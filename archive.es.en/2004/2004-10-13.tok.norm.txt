back in 1968 , a so-called " ruhr development program " aimed to improve the region 's infrastructure was started .
currently , the " goal 2 program 2002-2006 " represents yet another attempt to infuse life into dying cities . together with the european union , the state has set aside almost € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- to help fund companies working in six " fields of excellence , " including logistics , life sciences , micro systems and energy technology . small firms can especially profit from the program , said hartmut weigelt of the life technologies ruhr network , who helps identify fund-worthy projects at universities and in the private sector . a never-ending process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biomedical companies often lack the money to proceed with projects the money can help companies to set up new production technologies , especially in the biomedical sector , weigelt said , adding that the program aims to finance new projects that might not take off otherwise because of high economic risks . economic experts said the program is a step in the right direction . " structural change is not something that you can do and then you 're done with it , " said christoph schmidt , president of the rwi economic research institute .
" it has to go on , you have to keep adding things to be able to compete internationally .
that 's why it 's the right thing to focus on research and education , on new technologies , on scientific transfer . " bureaucratic hurdles but bureaucratic hurdles have prevented many companies from seeking funds so far , weigelt said : approval can take up to two years and applicants have to have matching funds - a problem for many german companies . " we have a structural problem , " weigelt said , adding that there 's a need to come up with financing mechanisms to raise a company 's equity share so that it can apply for funding . some success stories north rhine-westphalia is trying to do just that : the state is willing to vouch for up to 80 percent of bank credits .
time is running out to apply for the funds as € 130 million will return to the eu 's new technologies fund in 2006 if they have not been distributed . program officials can point to some success stories , however .
in bochum , 15 newly founded biomedical companies created about 1,000 new jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worker 's entering bochum 's opel factory another 5,000 are expected to be added in a new biomedical business park - a glimmer of hope in a city where 4,500 auto industry workers are currently fearing for their jobs following the news that general motors will make drastic cuts at its german subsidiary , opel . wiebke bomas -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de up to 7,000 jobs threatened at opel german car maker opel , the loss-making subsidiary of general motors , is to axe 6,000-7,000 jobs from a total german workforce of around 12,000 , according to news reports .

" germany 's task is simply to comply with eu rules . " but germany could face hefty fines if it loses the case in front of the court .
a decision is unlikely to come soon , however , as the court usually takes about two years to issue a verdict . vw has nothing to say a volkswagen spokesman at the company 's headquarters in wolfsburg , germany declined to comment on the commission 's action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany 's school of hard knocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students often need extra help in germany germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .
but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .

one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .

the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany 's school of hard knocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students often need extra help in germany germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .
but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

several nato members have criticized the fact that the two forces operate independently of one another .
german support for combat not likely struck said germany generally supported the nato initiative to increase its troops and expand its area of deployment , but he doubted his country 's parliament would support a change of its mandate to allow its troops to take on a combat mission .
with some 2,500 soldiers , germany is the largest contributor to the isaf peacekeeping mission .

" there is no intention to punish , " he added .
" germany 's task is simply to comply with eu rules . " but germany could face hefty fines if it loses the case in front of the court .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany 's school of hard knocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students often need extra help in germany germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .
but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

" bureaucratic hurdles but bureaucratic hurdles have prevented many companies from seeking funds so far , weigelt said : approval can take up to two years and applicants have to have matching funds - a problem for many german companies . " we have a structural problem , " weigelt said , adding that there 's a need to come up with financing mechanisms to raise a company 's equity share so that it can apply for funding . some success stories north rhine-westphalia is trying to do just that : the state is willing to vouch for up to 80 percent of bank credits .
time is running out to apply for the funds as € 130 million will return to the eu 's new technologies fund in 2006 if they have not been distributed . program officials can point to some success stories , however .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .

at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .

back in 1968 , a so-called " ruhr development program " aimed to improve the region 's infrastructure was started .
currently , the " goal 2 program 2002-2006 " represents yet another attempt to infuse life into dying cities . together with the european union , the state has set aside almost € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- to help fund companies working in six " fields of excellence , " including logistics , life sciences , micro systems and energy technology . small firms can especially profit from the program , said hartmut weigelt of the life technologies ruhr network , who helps identify fund-worthy projects at universities and in the private sector . a never-ending process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biomedical companies often lack the money to proceed with projects the money can help companies to set up new production technologies , especially in the biomedical sector , weigelt said , adding that the program aims to finance new projects that might not take off otherwise because of high economic risks . economic experts said the program is a step in the right direction . " structural change is not something that you can do and then you 're done with it , " said christoph schmidt , president of the rwi economic research institute .
" it has to go on , you have to keep adding things to be able to compete internationally .
that 's why it 's the right thing to focus on research and education , on new technologies , on scientific transfer . " bureaucratic hurdles but bureaucratic hurdles have prevented many companies from seeking funds so far , weigelt said : approval can take up to two years and applicants have to have matching funds - a problem for many german companies . " we have a structural problem , " weigelt said , adding that there 's a need to come up with financing mechanisms to raise a company 's equity share so that it can apply for funding . some success stories north rhine-westphalia is trying to do just that : the state is willing to vouch for up to 80 percent of bank credits .
time is running out to apply for the funds as € 130 million will return to the eu 's new technologies fund in 2006 if they have not been distributed . program officials can point to some success stories , however .
in bochum , 15 newly founded biomedical companies created about 1,000 new jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : worker 's entering bochum 's opel factory another 5,000 are expected to be added in a new biomedical business park - a glimmer of hope in a city where 4,500 auto industry workers are currently fearing for their jobs following the news that general motors will make drastic cuts at its german subsidiary , opel . wiebke bomas -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de up to 7,000 jobs threatened at opel german car maker opel , the loss-making subsidiary of general motors , is to axe 6,000-7,000 jobs from a total german workforce of around 12,000 , according to news reports .

" the vw law is a legacy of germany 's industrial past that is incompatible with the eu single market , " daniel gros , director of the brussels-based center of european policy studies , told reuters news service . " there is no intention to punish , " he added .
" germany 's task is simply to comply with eu rules . " but germany could face hefty fines if it loses the case in front of the court .
a decision is unlikely to come soon , however , as the court usually takes about two years to issue a verdict . vw has nothing to say a volkswagen spokesman at the company 's headquarters in wolfsburg , germany declined to comment on the commission 's action . " we have nothing to say on the matter , " he said .
" we are not the party involved in the whole procedure . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff but christian wulff -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , said the lawsuit was as " as useful as a hole in the head .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .

" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

" for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany opposes us plan in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mandate is to stabilize afghanistan not fight terrorism at a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania on wednesday , germany objected to washington 's proposal for nato forces to take over the us military mission in afghanistan as part of next year 's reorganization efforts . german defense minister peter struck , who met nato counterparts including us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for informal talks in romania , told reporters he opposed the proposal to integrate the nato peacekeeping force in afghanistan within the 18,000 strong us-led combat mission fighting remnants of the taliban and al qaeda .
nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldier on patrol in kabul while isaf is primary involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts , the separate us mission " operation enduring freedom " includes heavily armed units fighting suspected militants and terrorists , notably on the pakistan border in the southeastern part of the country .
several nato members have criticized the fact that the two forces operate independently of one another .
german support for combat not likely struck said germany generally supported the nato initiative to increase its troops and expand its area of deployment , but he doubted his country 's parliament would support a change of its mandate to allow its troops to take on a combat mission .
with some 2,500 soldiers , germany is the largest contributor to the isaf peacekeeping mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan " i will not accept that germany continues to be heavily engaged in afghanistan while others , despite their pledges , have held back from doing the same , " struck told the gathering of 26 defense ministers " i do not believe that the german government will be prepared to deploy its current 2,500 soldiers in a fight against terrorism .
we would prefer to continue using them for reconstruction efforts , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us blames europe for failures in afghanistan with the clock ticking on crucial presidential polls in afghanistan next month , the us congress has blasted european nations for not sending enough troops to bolster security in the volatile country .

back in 1968 , a so-called " ruhr development program " aimed to improve the region 's infrastructure was started .
currently , the " goal 2 program 2002-2006 " represents yet another attempt to infuse life into dying cities . together with the european union , the state has set aside almost € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- to help fund companies working in six " fields of excellence , " including logistics , life sciences , micro systems and energy technology . small firms can especially profit from the program , said hartmut weigelt of the life technologies ruhr network , who helps identify fund-worthy projects at universities and in the private sector . a never-ending process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biomedical companies often lack the money to proceed with projects the money can help companies to set up new production technologies , especially in the biomedical sector , weigelt said , adding that the program aims to finance new projects that might not take off otherwise because of high economic risks . economic experts said the program is a step in the right direction . " structural change is not something that you can do and then you 're done with it , " said christoph schmidt , president of the rwi economic research institute .
" it has to go on , you have to keep adding things to be able to compete internationally .
that 's why it 's the right thing to focus on research and education , on new technologies , on scientific transfer . " bureaucratic hurdles but bureaucratic hurdles have prevented many companies from seeking funds so far , weigelt said : approval can take up to two years and applicants have to have matching funds - a problem for many german companies . " we have a structural problem , " weigelt said , adding that there 's a need to come up with financing mechanisms to raise a company 's equity share so that it can apply for funding . some success stories north rhine-westphalia is trying to do just that : the state is willing to vouch for up to 80 percent of bank credits .
time is running out to apply for the funds as € 130 million will return to the eu 's new technologies fund in 2006 if they have not been distributed . program officials can point to some success stories , however .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is . " had i finished off france in ' 39 , then world history would have taken another course , " hitler says in german , alternating between rapid and slow speech and pausing frequently .
" but then i had to wait until 1940 . " hitler laments two-front war " then a two-front war , that was bad luck .
after that , even we were broken , " hitler says , explaining the setbacks of his campaign to conquer the soviet union to c.g.e. mannerheim , commander of the finnish forces during world war ii . the recording was made in secret on the evening of june 4 , 1942 , when hitler made a surprise visit to finland to congratulate the german ally on his 75th birthday . " that he came to finland was a political move , " said ohto manninen , professor of war history at finland 's national defense college .
" he wanted finland to remain in the war on germany 's side . " in 1941 , finland allied itself with nazi germany and attacked the soviet union just days after hitler launched his campaign against stalin , to regain territories lost to moscow in the winter war of 1939-41 . finnish alliance in war against red army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish troops aided the nazis in the siege of leningrad .
in 1942 , germany had 200,000 soldiers based in finland .
together the two allies grabbed large areas in northwestern russia and besieged saint petersburg , then called leningrad .
with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .
" yle was however allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container , " vihonen added , pointing to a cardboard box with the remains of several red wax seals on it . führer rues taking on the soviets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recording , which lasts for 18 minutes , ends abruptly in mid-sentence as hitler explains why it had been difficult to help finland more in their common war against stalin . " we did n't know ourselves just how monstrous this powerful beast was , " hitler says .
" had i known , i would have been more reluctant , but i had already made the decision then , and there would be no other possibility , " he added . yle radio is scheduled to broadcast the tape in its entirety with an accompanying documentary on oct .

but reliable polls show that germans have an increasing fear of islam .
it may be a frightening notion , but upon hearing the word " islam " many germans automatically think of fanaticism , repression of women , and terrorism .
an entire world religion seems to have fallen into disrepute .
this is not only the fault of the media , who often fail to clearly distinguish between believers and self-declared religious warriors .
the fault lies above all with religious extremists like metin kaplan , who have enormous public influence although they only have a tiny minority of people supporting them .
rejected by turks no question : kaplan 's outlawed " caliphate state " organization is dangerous and rightfully forbidden as anti-constitutional .
but in fact , it is a sect without popular support .
as with the majority of germans , the majority of turks and muslims in germany reject the machinations of the self styled " caliph of cologne . "
but they suffer because they themselves are either consistently identified with these machinations , or feel they have to have to justify themselves .
it is good that kaplan has finally been sent out of the country - even if it seems like it only came about because german justice had to cheat a bit to get it done , given its prior errors .
it is good for the image of muslims in germany when someone like kaplan is no longer shown around in the media as being a meaningful , important muslim .
and even though it came so very late , the deportation is also a confirmation of germany 's image of itself as being a true democracy .
the direction of the judgement is correct , and was already confirmed through previous judgements : those who endlessly hound jews , who want to get rid of democracy , and publicly call for murder , have lost their right to stay here .
test case for turkey a lawful state must treat its enemies fairly .
but it does n't need to be mocked by jurisprudence , and it does n't need to protect its enemies from lawsuits in other countries .
especially when the other country has agreed to a fair trial .
kaplan on wednesday already appeared before a judge in istanbul to face treason charges over his alleged involvement in a 1998 failed attempt to crash a plan into the mausoleum of mustafa kemal atatürk , the founder of the modern , secular turkish state .
for turkey , the kaplan case is an extremely important test of reliability .
the country must show that its recent justice-system reforms have teeth , and that even treason cases can be tried fairly and smoothly - as expected from an eu-accession candidate .
german interior minister otto schily says he has no doubt that the trial will be constitutionally valid .
it is rather unlikely that metin kaplan himself will be mistreated .
because ankara is highly aware that the case is in the spotlight in europe .
the decisive question is rather whether the turkish legal system will make a case based on six-year old confessions from alleged kaplan followers - confessions that , according to german courts , were forced by torture .
if this suspicion ca n't be purged and other proof is n't found , then the kaplan case can once more turn into a never ending story .

but reliable polls show that germans have an increasing fear of islam .
it may be a frightening notion , but upon hearing the word " islam " many germans automatically think of fanaticism , repression of women , and terrorism .
an entire world religion seems to have fallen into disrepute .
this is not only the fault of the media , who often fail to clearly distinguish between believers and self-declared religious warriors .
the fault lies above all with religious extremists like metin kaplan , who have enormous public influence although they only have a tiny minority of people supporting them .
rejected by turks no question : kaplan 's outlawed " caliphate state " organization is dangerous and rightfully forbidden as anti-constitutional .
but in fact , it is a sect without popular support .
as with the majority of germans , the majority of turks and muslims in germany reject the machinations of the self styled " caliph of cologne . "
but they suffer because they themselves are either consistently identified with these machinations , or feel they have to have to justify themselves .
it is good that kaplan has finally been sent out of the country - even if it seems like it only came about because german justice had to cheat a bit to get it done , given its prior errors .
it is good for the image of muslims in germany when someone like kaplan is no longer shown around in the media as being a meaningful , important muslim .
and even though it came so very late , the deportation is also a confirmation of germany 's image of itself as being a true democracy .
the direction of the judgement is correct , and was already confirmed through previous judgements : those who endlessly hound jews , who want to get rid of democracy , and publicly call for murder , have lost their right to stay here .
test case for turkey a lawful state must treat its enemies fairly .
but it does n't need to be mocked by jurisprudence , and it does n't need to protect its enemies from lawsuits in other countries .
especially when the other country has agreed to a fair trial .
kaplan on wednesday already appeared before a judge in istanbul to face treason charges over his alleged involvement in a 1998 failed attempt to crash a plan into the mausoleum of mustafa kemal atatürk , the founder of the modern , secular turkish state .
for turkey , the kaplan case is an extremely important test of reliability .
the country must show that its recent justice-system reforms have teeth , and that even treason cases can be tried fairly and smoothly - as expected from an eu-accession candidate .
german interior minister otto schily says he has no doubt that the trial will be constitutionally valid .
it is rather unlikely that metin kaplan himself will be mistreated .
because ankara is highly aware that the case is in the spotlight in europe .
the decisive question is rather whether the turkish legal system will make a case based on six-year old confessions from alleged kaplan followers - confessions that , according to german courts , were forced by torture .

but reliable polls show that germans have an increasing fear of islam .
it may be a frightening notion , but upon hearing the word " islam " many germans automatically think of fanaticism , repression of women , and terrorism .
an entire world religion seems to have fallen into disrepute .
this is not only the fault of the media , who often fail to clearly distinguish between believers and self-declared religious warriors .
the fault lies above all with religious extremists like metin kaplan , who have enormous public influence although they only have a tiny minority of people supporting them .
rejected by turks no question : kaplan 's outlawed " caliphate state " organization is dangerous and rightfully forbidden as anti-constitutional .
but in fact , it is a sect without popular support .
as with the majority of germans , the majority of turks and muslims in germany reject the machinations of the self styled " caliph of cologne . "
but they suffer because they themselves are either consistently identified with these machinations , or feel they have to have to justify themselves .
it is good that kaplan has finally been sent out of the country - even if it seems like it only came about because german justice had to cheat a bit to get it done , given its prior errors .
it is good for the image of muslims in germany when someone like kaplan is no longer shown around in the media as being a meaningful , important muslim .
and even though it came so very late , the deportation is also a confirmation of germany 's image of itself as being a true democracy .
the direction of the judgement is correct , and was already confirmed through previous judgements : those who endlessly hound jews , who want to get rid of democracy , and publicly call for murder , have lost their right to stay here .
test case for turkey a lawful state must treat its enemies fairly .
but it does n't need to be mocked by jurisprudence , and it does n't need to protect its enemies from lawsuits in other countries .
especially when the other country has agreed to a fair trial .
kaplan on wednesday already appeared before a judge in istanbul to face treason charges over his alleged involvement in a 1998 failed attempt to crash a plan into the mausoleum of mustafa kemal atatürk , the founder of the modern , secular turkish state .
for turkey , the kaplan case is an extremely important test of reliability .
the country must show that its recent justice-system reforms have teeth , and that even treason cases can be tried fairly and smoothly - as expected from an eu-accession candidate .
german interior minister otto schily says he has no doubt that the trial will be constitutionally valid .
it is rather unlikely that metin kaplan himself will be mistreated .
because ankara is highly aware that the case is in the spotlight in europe .
the decisive question is rather whether the turkish legal system will make a case based on six-year old confessions from alleged kaplan followers - confessions that , according to german courts , were forced by torture .
if this suspicion ca n't be purged and other proof is n't found , then the kaplan case can once more turn into a never ending story .

vw 's chief negotiator josef-fidelis senn said that one of the conditions for job guarantees would be a sharp reduction in labor costs .
" we 're still a long way apart on the details , " senn said .
the next round of negotiations was scheduled to take place on oct .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is .

" we have a structural problem , " weigelt said , adding that there 's a need to come up with financing mechanisms to raise a company 's equity share so that it can apply for funding . some success stories north rhine-westphalia is trying to do just that : the state is willing to vouch for up to 80 percent of bank credits .
time is running out to apply for the funds as € 130 million will return to the eu 's new technologies fund in 2006 if they have not been distributed . program officials can point to some success stories , however .

" the state has made it clear that someone who opposes the rule of law and the constitution has no place in our country , " schily told reporters .
while kaplan still has two weeks to appeal the deportation to a higher court , the minister said he considered the case closed . immediately after tuesday 's cologne court ruling that kaplan 's appeal before a federal court in leipzig did not justify his continued residency in germany , city officials had made it clear that they intended to act swiftly on the court 's decision . " we plan to deport him today , " cologne 's city spokeswoman , inge schürmann , told reporters .
a higher court could have stopped the process but apparently failed to do so . bildunterschrift : a private lear jet , allegedly transporting turkish islamic militant metin kaplan , leaves a hangar at düsseldorf international airport on tuesday . the cologne judges found that kaplan , the self-appointed " caliph of cologne " can be seen as an " identity figure for islamic extremism , " making it necessary to end his residency in germany . kaplan received a deportation order in may .
his application for asylum in germany was rejected in 2003 after he served prison time for inciting his followers to murder one of his rivals . germany has banned his caliphate state group , which calls for the overthrow of turkey 's secular government . in may , kaplan escaped arrest by police after the ruling by disappearing for several days .
a federal court then granted him an appeal to stay in germany .
he has been required to report to the police every week . kaplan faces treason charges in turkey and has been resisting deportation by arguing that he would face torture in his native country . he is accused of masterminding a failed 1998 plot to crash a plane laden with explosives into the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , the founder of the modern secular turkish state . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .

" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .

one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .

the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .

besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .

" much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .

one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany 's school of hard knocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students often need extra help in germany germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .
but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is . " had i finished off france in ' 39 , then world history would have taken another course , " hitler says in german , alternating between rapid and slow speech and pausing frequently .
" but then i had to wait until 1940 . " hitler laments two-front war " then a two-front war , that was bad luck .

with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .

" had i known , i would have been more reluctant , but i had already made the decision then , and there would be no other possibility , " he added . yle radio is scheduled to broadcast the tape in its entirety with an accompanying documentary on oct .

" for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .
" yle was however allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container , " vihonen added , pointing to a cardboard box with the remains of several red wax seals on it . führer rues taking on the soviets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recording , which lasts for 18 minutes , ends abruptly in mid-sentence as hitler explains why it had been difficult to help finland more in their common war against stalin . " we did n't know ourselves just how monstrous this powerful beast was , " hitler says .
" had i known , i would have been more reluctant , but i had already made the decision then , and there would be no other possibility , " he added . yle radio is scheduled to broadcast the tape in its entirety with an accompanying documentary on oct .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is . " had i finished off france in ' 39 , then world history would have taken another course , " hitler says in german , alternating between rapid and slow speech and pausing frequently .
" but then i had to wait until 1940 . " hitler laments two-front war " then a two-front war , that was bad luck .
after that , even we were broken , " hitler says , explaining the setbacks of his campaign to conquer the soviet union to c.g.e. mannerheim , commander of the finnish forces during world war ii . the recording was made in secret on the evening of june 4 , 1942 , when hitler made a surprise visit to finland to congratulate the german ally on his 75th birthday . " that he came to finland was a political move , " said ohto manninen , professor of war history at finland 's national defense college .
" he wanted finland to remain in the war on germany 's side . " in 1941 , finland allied itself with nazi germany and attacked the soviet union just days after hitler launched his campaign against stalin , to regain territories lost to moscow in the winter war of 1939-41 . finnish alliance in war against red army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish troops aided the nazis in the siege of leningrad .
in 1942 , germany had 200,000 soldiers based in finland .
together the two allies grabbed large areas in northwestern russia and besieged saint petersburg , then called leningrad .
with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .
" yle was however allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container , " vihonen added , pointing to a cardboard box with the remains of several red wax seals on it . führer rues taking on the soviets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recording , which lasts for 18 minutes , ends abruptly in mid-sentence as hitler explains why it had been difficult to help finland more in their common war against stalin . " we did n't know ourselves just how monstrous this powerful beast was , " hitler says .
" had i known , i would have been more reluctant , but i had already made the decision then , and there would be no other possibility , " he added . yle radio is scheduled to broadcast the tape in its entirety with an accompanying documentary on oct .

" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement . " struck also welcomed us democratic presidential candidate john kerry 's call for an international summit on iraq . kerry has maintained during his campaign for the presidency that he would have more success getting traditional us allies and iraq war opponents like germany and france to help in iraq .
in a debate last month with president george w. bush , kerry said that if elected he would call for a summit on iraq .
" this is a very sensible proposal , " struck said .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference . "
official denial the comment makes struck the first member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to hint that a rethink on germany 's official stance on the deployment of soldiers in iraq , may be underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a u.s. army base in baqouba , iraq , monday , july 26 , 2004 .
up to now , germany has helped train policemen and soldiers outside of iraq 's borders , but has strictly refused to send troops to the country . german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his firm opposition to deploying troops to iraq , a spokesman said , slapping down hints at a change in policy from his defense minister . " to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , he added . struck 's comments have also been played down by the greens , the junior , mainly pacifist , partner in the ruling coalition . green party defense expert winfried nachtwei told german television station zdf he assumed struck meant that there would be no deployment of german soldiers to iraq " really , in the foreseeable future . "
the comment was just an acknowledgement that no one knows what the case could be in five years , nachtwei said . germany , who along with france was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led war in iraq , has categorically refused to send soldiers to iraq .
it has also ruled out sending soldiers there as part of a nato-led training program for iraqi soldiers . berlin however is currently training iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates as well as offered the use of some of its bases in bavaria to train iraqi military recruits .
it has also agreed to deliver 20 armored vehicles to iraq . urgent call for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq deputy prime minister barham saleh , right , delivers a speech at an iraq donors meeting in tokyo , wednesday , oct.13 , 2004 .
meanwhile , at a two-day donors ' conference in tokyo aimed at assessing how to spend billions of dollars in aid pledged to the war-shattered nation , an iraqi official pleaded for greater involvement by the international community . interim deputy prime minister barham saleh told representatives of some 55 countries and organizations that donors should waive the debt from the rule of saddam hussein , and that the united nations should play a more active role in iraq . germany , along with italy and russia , is backing a french proposal for an immediate write off of 50 percent of iraqi debt . the meeting aims not to raise more pledges , but rather to figure out how to disburse the $ 14 billion -lrb- € 11.39 billion -rrb- pledged at a donors ' conference in madrid last year . past pledges saleh urged donors to live up to their past pledges .
only a few hundred million dollars have so far been spent .
" assistance and aid in the short term is the key to destroying the causes of terrorism , " saleh said .
" it is also the only way we can build a sustainable , long-term future for our people . " he urged countries that were holding back on " political or geopolitical grounds " not to delay their support , and noted that " the images of calamity and carnage that you see on television screens do not reflect the reality of iraq . "
germany pledged more than € 100 million to iraq , about 50 million of that through european union funds , to which france also contributes . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence chief warns of chaos in iraq the head of german intelligence warned the fighting in iraq could lead the country to chaos , making it a haven for terrorists affiliated with osama bin laden - who is still alive and active .

the german group would send a sales memorandum to prospective buyers in the coming weeks , a degussa spokeswoman said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.10.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc most germans want poll on turkey a majority of germans want a referendum on the possible entry of turkey into the european union , according to an opinion poll in stern magazine published on wednesday .
fifty-nine percent of those questioned by the forsa polling institute were in favour of a referendum , while 39 percent were against .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will vote in favor of turkey starting membership talks when eu leaders gather in december .
schröder has indicated that the german constitution would have to be changed to allow a referendum on the issue .
such a change would require the support of a two-thirds majority of the lower and upper houses of parliament .

" the vw law is a legacy of germany 's industrial past that is incompatible with the eu single market , " daniel gros , director of the brussels-based center of european policy studies , told reuters news service . " there is no intention to punish , " he added .
" germany 's task is simply to comply with eu rules . " but germany could face hefty fines if it loses the case in front of the court .
a decision is unlikely to come soon , however , as the court usually takes about two years to issue a verdict . vw has nothing to say a volkswagen spokesman at the company 's headquarters in wolfsburg , germany declined to comment on the commission 's action . " we have nothing to say on the matter , " he said .
" we are not the party involved in the whole procedure . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian wulff but christian wulff -lrb- photo -rrb- , the christian democratic premier of lower saxony , said the lawsuit was as " as useful as a hole in the head .

fifty-nine percent of those questioned by the forsa polling institute were in favour of a referendum , while 39 percent were against .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will vote in favor of turkey starting membership talks when eu leaders gather in december .
schröder has indicated that the german constitution would have to be changed to allow a referendum on the issue .
such a change would require the support of a two-thirds majority of the lower and upper houses of parliament .
germany is home to two and a half million turkish immigrants , yet the issue of turkey joining the eu divides opinion .
the main opposition party in germany , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against turkey becoming an eu member , preferring instead to see the predominantly muslim nation have a ' privileged relationship ' with the eu .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de merkel calls for petition against turkish membership germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel has called for a petition to be drawn up against turkey 's membership of the european union and has advocated privileged partnership status as an alternative .

" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement . " struck also welcomed us democratic presidential candidate john kerry 's call for an international summit on iraq . kerry has maintained during his campaign for the presidency that he would have more success getting traditional us allies and iraq war opponents like germany and france to help in iraq .
in a debate last month with president george w. bush , kerry said that if elected he would call for a summit on iraq .
" this is a very sensible proposal , " struck said .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference . "
official denial the comment makes struck the first member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to hint that a rethink on germany 's official stance on the deployment of soldiers in iraq , may be underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a u.s. army base in baqouba , iraq , monday , july 26 , 2004 .
up to now , germany has helped train policemen and soldiers outside of iraq 's borders , but has strictly refused to send troops to the country . german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his firm opposition to deploying troops to iraq , a spokesman said , slapping down hints at a change in policy from his defense minister . " to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , he added . struck 's comments have also been played down by the greens , the junior , mainly pacifist , partner in the ruling coalition . green party defense expert winfried nachtwei told german television station zdf he assumed struck meant that there would be no deployment of german soldiers to iraq " really , in the foreseeable future . "
the comment was just an acknowledgement that no one knows what the case could be in five years , nachtwei said . germany , who along with france was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led war in iraq , has categorically refused to send soldiers to iraq .
it has also ruled out sending soldiers there as part of a nato-led training program for iraqi soldiers . berlin however is currently training iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates as well as offered the use of some of its bases in bavaria to train iraqi military recruits .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is . " had i finished off france in ' 39 , then world history would have taken another course , " hitler says in german , alternating between rapid and slow speech and pausing frequently .
" but then i had to wait until 1940 . " hitler laments two-front war " then a two-front war , that was bad luck .
after that , even we were broken , " hitler says , explaining the setbacks of his campaign to conquer the soviet union to c.g.e. mannerheim , commander of the finnish forces during world war ii . the recording was made in secret on the evening of june 4 , 1942 , when hitler made a surprise visit to finland to congratulate the german ally on his 75th birthday . " that he came to finland was a political move , " said ohto manninen , professor of war history at finland 's national defense college .
" he wanted finland to remain in the war on germany 's side . " in 1941 , finland allied itself with nazi germany and attacked the soviet union just days after hitler launched his campaign against stalin , to regain territories lost to moscow in the winter war of 1939-41 . finnish alliance in war against red army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish troops aided the nazis in the siege of leningrad .
in 1942 , germany had 200,000 soldiers based in finland .
together the two allies grabbed large areas in northwestern russia and besieged saint petersburg , then called leningrad .
with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .
" yle was however allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container , " vihonen added , pointing to a cardboard box with the remains of several red wax seals on it . führer rues taking on the soviets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recording , which lasts for 18 minutes , ends abruptly in mid-sentence as hitler explains why it had been difficult to help finland more in their common war against stalin . " we did n't know ourselves just how monstrous this powerful beast was , " hitler says .
" had i known , i would have been more reluctant , but i had already made the decision then , and there would be no other possibility , " he added . yle radio is scheduled to broadcast the tape in its entirety with an accompanying documentary on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.10.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc most germans want poll on turkey a majority of germans want a referendum on the possible entry of turkey into the european union , according to an opinion poll in stern magazine published on wednesday .
fifty-nine percent of those questioned by the forsa polling institute were in favour of a referendum , while 39 percent were against .
chancellor gerhard schröder has said he will vote in favor of turkey starting membership talks when eu leaders gather in december .
schröder has indicated that the german constitution would have to be changed to allow a referendum on the issue .
such a change would require the support of a two-thirds majority of the lower and upper houses of parliament .
germany is home to two and a half million turkish immigrants , yet the issue of turkey joining the eu divides opinion .
the main opposition party in germany , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is against turkey becoming an eu member , preferring instead to see the predominantly muslim nation have a ' privileged relationship ' with the eu .
-lrb- afp -rrb- dw-world.de merkel calls for petition against turkish membership germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel has called for a petition to be drawn up against turkey 's membership of the european union and has advocated privileged partnership status as an alternative .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "

at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .

" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .

" the vw law is a legacy of germany 's industrial past that is incompatible with the eu single market , " daniel gros , director of the brussels-based center of european policy studies , told reuters news service . " there is no intention to punish , " he added .
" germany 's task is simply to comply with eu rules . " but germany could face hefty fines if it loses the case in front of the court .
a decision is unlikely to come soon , however , as the court usually takes about two years to issue a verdict . vw has nothing to say a volkswagen spokesman at the company 's headquarters in wolfsburg , germany declined to comment on the commission 's action . " we have nothing to say on the matter , " he said .
" we are not the party involved in the whole procedure .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

german support for combat not likely struck said germany generally supported the nato initiative to increase its troops and expand its area of deployment , but he doubted his country 's parliament would support a change of its mandate to allow its troops to take on a combat mission .

" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.10.2004 opinion : kaplan ouster is good for all großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaplan already appeared before a turkish judge on wednesday the deportation to turkey of radical islamic leader and accused terrorist metin kaplan is good news for germany , writes dw 's rainer sollich . it is mostly only said behind closed doors .
but reliable polls show that germans have an increasing fear of islam .
it may be a frightening notion , but upon hearing the word " islam " many germans automatically think of fanaticism , repression of women , and terrorism .
an entire world religion seems to have fallen into disrepute .
this is not only the fault of the media , who often fail to clearly distinguish between believers and self-declared religious warriors .
the fault lies above all with religious extremists like metin kaplan , who have enormous public influence although they only have a tiny minority of people supporting them .
rejected by turks no question : kaplan 's outlawed " caliphate state " organization is dangerous and rightfully forbidden as anti-constitutional .
but in fact , it is a sect without popular support .
as with the majority of germans , the majority of turks and muslims in germany reject the machinations of the self styled " caliph of cologne . "
but they suffer because they themselves are either consistently identified with these machinations , or feel they have to have to justify themselves .
it is good that kaplan has finally been sent out of the country - even if it seems like it only came about because german justice had to cheat a bit to get it done , given its prior errors .
it is good for the image of muslims in germany when someone like kaplan is no longer shown around in the media as being a meaningful , important muslim .
and even though it came so very late , the deportation is also a confirmation of germany 's image of itself as being a true democracy .
the direction of the judgement is correct , and was already confirmed through previous judgements : those who endlessly hound jews , who want to get rid of democracy , and publicly call for murder , have lost their right to stay here .
test case for turkey a lawful state must treat its enemies fairly .
but it does n't need to be mocked by jurisprudence , and it does n't need to protect its enemies from lawsuits in other countries .
especially when the other country has agreed to a fair trial .
kaplan on wednesday already appeared before a judge in istanbul to face treason charges over his alleged involvement in a 1998 failed attempt to crash a plan into the mausoleum of mustafa kemal atatürk , the founder of the modern , secular turkish state .
for turkey , the kaplan case is an extremely important test of reliability .
the country must show that its recent justice-system reforms have teeth , and that even treason cases can be tried fairly and smoothly - as expected from an eu-accession candidate .
german interior minister otto schily says he has no doubt that the trial will be constitutionally valid .
it is rather unlikely that metin kaplan himself will be mistreated .
because ankara is highly aware that the case is in the spotlight in europe .
the decisive question is rather whether the turkish legal system will make a case based on six-year old confessions from alleged kaplan followers - confessions that , according to german courts , were forced by torture .
if this suspicion ca n't be purged and other proof is n't found , then the kaplan case can once more turn into a never ending story .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is . " had i finished off france in ' 39 , then world history would have taken another course , " hitler says in german , alternating between rapid and slow speech and pausing frequently .
" but then i had to wait until 1940 . " hitler laments two-front war " then a two-front war , that was bad luck .
after that , even we were broken , " hitler says , explaining the setbacks of his campaign to conquer the soviet union to c.g.e. mannerheim , commander of the finnish forces during world war ii . the recording was made in secret on the evening of june 4 , 1942 , when hitler made a surprise visit to finland to congratulate the german ally on his 75th birthday . " that he came to finland was a political move , " said ohto manninen , professor of war history at finland 's national defense college .
" he wanted finland to remain in the war on germany 's side .

together the two allies grabbed large areas in northwestern russia and besieged saint petersburg , then called leningrad .
with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .

" had i known , i would have been more reluctant , but i had already made the decision then , and there would be no other possibility , " he added . yle radio is scheduled to broadcast the tape in its entirety with an accompanying documentary on oct .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is . " had i finished off france in ' 39 , then world history would have taken another course , " hitler says in german , alternating between rapid and slow speech and pausing frequently .
" but then i had to wait until 1940 . " hitler laments two-front war " then a two-front war , that was bad luck .
after that , even we were broken , " hitler says , explaining the setbacks of his campaign to conquer the soviet union to c.g.e. mannerheim , commander of the finnish forces during world war ii . the recording was made in secret on the evening of june 4 , 1942 , when hitler made a surprise visit to finland to congratulate the german ally on his 75th birthday . " that he came to finland was a political move , " said ohto manninen , professor of war history at finland 's national defense college .
" he wanted finland to remain in the war on germany 's side . " in 1941 , finland allied itself with nazi germany and attacked the soviet union just days after hitler launched his campaign against stalin , to regain territories lost to moscow in the winter war of 1939-41 . finnish alliance in war against red army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish troops aided the nazis in the siege of leningrad .
in 1942 , germany had 200,000 soldiers based in finland .
together the two allies grabbed large areas in northwestern russia and besieged saint petersburg , then called leningrad .
with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .

" that he came to finland was a political move , " said ohto manninen , professor of war history at finland 's national defense college .
" he wanted finland to remain in the war on germany 's side . " in 1941 , finland allied itself with nazi germany and attacked the soviet union just days after hitler launched his campaign against stalin , to regain territories lost to moscow in the winter war of 1939-41 . finnish alliance in war against red army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish troops aided the nazis in the siege of leningrad .
in 1942 , germany had 200,000 soldiers based in finland .
together the two allies grabbed large areas in northwestern russia and besieged saint petersburg , then called leningrad .
with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .
" yle was however allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container , " vihonen added , pointing to a cardboard box with the remains of several red wax seals on it . führer rues taking on the soviets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recording , which lasts for 18 minutes , ends abruptly in mid-sentence as hitler explains why it had been difficult to help finland more in their common war against stalin . " we did n't know ourselves just how monstrous this powerful beast was , " hitler says .
" had i known , i would have been more reluctant , but i had already made the decision then , and there would be no other possibility , " he added . yle radio is scheduled to broadcast the tape in its entirety with an accompanying documentary on oct .

but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .

it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany opposes us plan in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mandate is to stabilize afghanistan not fight terrorism at a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania on wednesday , germany objected to washington 's proposal for nato forces to take over the us military mission in afghanistan as part of next year 's reorganization efforts . german defense minister peter struck , who met nato counterparts including us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for informal talks in romania , told reporters he opposed the proposal to integrate the nato peacekeeping force in afghanistan within the 18,000 strong us-led combat mission fighting remnants of the taliban and al qaeda .
nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

several nato members have criticized the fact that the two forces operate independently of one another .
german support for combat not likely struck said germany generally supported the nato initiative to increase its troops and expand its area of deployment , but he doubted his country 's parliament would support a change of its mandate to allow its troops to take on a combat mission .
with some 2,500 soldiers , germany is the largest contributor to the isaf peacekeeping mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan " i will not accept that germany continues to be heavily engaged in afghanistan while others , despite their pledges , have held back from doing the same , " struck told the gathering of 26 defense ministers " i do not believe that the german government will be prepared to deploy its current 2,500 soldiers in a fight against terrorism .
we would prefer to continue using them for reconstruction efforts , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us blames europe for failures in afghanistan with the clock ticking on crucial presidential polls in afghanistan next month , the us congress has blasted european nations for not sending enough troops to bolster security in the volatile country .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany signals shift on iraq policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : struck suggested german solders could someday go to iraq in a possible softening of its strict non-deployment policy in iraq , germany 's defense minister said he could not rule out sending troops there in the future . in a first sign that germany may be altering its iraq deployment policy , defense minister peter struck has said he could someday be open to sending solders to fight in iraq . in an interview with the financial times newspaper on wednesday , struck said that germany might deploy troops if conditions in the country , now plagued by insurgency , changed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck told the paper .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement . " struck also welcomed us democratic presidential candidate john kerry 's call for an international summit on iraq . kerry has maintained during his campaign for the presidency that he would have more success getting traditional us allies and iraq war opponents like germany and france to help in iraq .
in a debate last month with president george w. bush , kerry said that if elected he would call for a summit on iraq .
" this is a very sensible proposal , " struck said .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference . "
official denial the comment makes struck the first member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to hint that a rethink on germany 's official stance on the deployment of soldiers in iraq , may be underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a u.s. army base in baqouba , iraq , monday , july 26 , 2004 .
up to now , germany has helped train policemen and soldiers outside of iraq 's borders , but has strictly refused to send troops to the country . german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his firm opposition to deploying troops to iraq , a spokesman said , slapping down hints at a change in policy from his defense minister . " to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , he added . struck 's comments have also been played down by the greens , the junior , mainly pacifist , partner in the ruling coalition . green party defense expert winfried nachtwei told german television station zdf he assumed struck meant that there would be no deployment of german soldiers to iraq " really , in the foreseeable future . "
the comment was just an acknowledgement that no one knows what the case could be in five years , nachtwei said . germany , who along with france was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led war in iraq , has categorically refused to send soldiers to iraq .
it has also ruled out sending soldiers there as part of a nato-led training program for iraqi soldiers . berlin however is currently training iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates as well as offered the use of some of its bases in bavaria to train iraqi military recruits .
it has also agreed to deliver 20 armored vehicles to iraq . urgent call for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq deputy prime minister barham saleh , right , delivers a speech at an iraq donors meeting in tokyo , wednesday , oct.13 , 2004 .
meanwhile , at a two-day donors ' conference in tokyo aimed at assessing how to spend billions of dollars in aid pledged to the war-shattered nation , an iraqi official pleaded for greater involvement by the international community . interim deputy prime minister barham saleh told representatives of some 55 countries and organizations that donors should waive the debt from the rule of saddam hussein , and that the united nations should play a more active role in iraq . germany , along with italy and russia , is backing a french proposal for an immediate write off of 50 percent of iraqi debt . the meeting aims not to raise more pledges , but rather to figure out how to disburse the $ 14 billion -lrb- € 11.39 billion -rrb- pledged at a donors ' conference in madrid last year . past pledges saleh urged donors to live up to their past pledges .
only a few hundred million dollars have so far been spent .
" assistance and aid in the short term is the key to destroying the causes of terrorism , " saleh said .
" it is also the only way we can build a sustainable , long-term future for our people . " he urged countries that were holding back on " political or geopolitical grounds " not to delay their support , and noted that " the images of calamity and carnage that you see on television screens do not reflect the reality of iraq . "
germany pledged more than € 100 million to iraq , about 50 million of that through european union funds , to which france also contributes . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence chief warns of chaos in iraq the head of german intelligence warned the fighting in iraq could lead the country to chaos , making it a haven for terrorists affiliated with osama bin laden - who is still alive and active .

" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement . " struck also welcomed us democratic presidential candidate john kerry 's call for an international summit on iraq . kerry has maintained during his campaign for the presidency that he would have more success getting traditional us allies and iraq war opponents like germany and france to help in iraq .
in a debate last month with president george w. bush , kerry said that if elected he would call for a summit on iraq .
" this is a very sensible proposal , " struck said .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference . "
official denial the comment makes struck the first member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to hint that a rethink on germany 's official stance on the deployment of soldiers in iraq , may be underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a u.s. army base in baqouba , iraq , monday , july 26 , 2004 .
up to now , germany has helped train policemen and soldiers outside of iraq 's borders , but has strictly refused to send troops to the country . german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his firm opposition to deploying troops to iraq , a spokesman said , slapping down hints at a change in policy from his defense minister . " to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , he added . struck 's comments have also been played down by the greens , the junior , mainly pacifist , partner in the ruling coalition . green party defense expert winfried nachtwei told german television station zdf he assumed struck meant that there would be no deployment of german soldiers to iraq " really , in the foreseeable future . "
the comment was just an acknowledgement that no one knows what the case could be in five years , nachtwei said . germany , who along with france was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led war in iraq , has categorically refused to send soldiers to iraq .
it has also ruled out sending soldiers there as part of a nato-led training program for iraqi soldiers . berlin however is currently training iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates as well as offered the use of some of its bases in bavaria to train iraqi military recruits .
it has also agreed to deliver 20 armored vehicles to iraq . urgent call for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq deputy prime minister barham saleh , right , delivers a speech at an iraq donors meeting in tokyo , wednesday , oct.13 , 2004 .
meanwhile , at a two-day donors ' conference in tokyo aimed at assessing how to spend billions of dollars in aid pledged to the war-shattered nation , an iraqi official pleaded for greater involvement by the international community . interim deputy prime minister barham saleh told representatives of some 55 countries and organizations that donors should waive the debt from the rule of saddam hussein , and that the united nations should play a more active role in iraq . germany , along with italy and russia , is backing a french proposal for an immediate write off of 50 percent of iraqi debt . the meeting aims not to raise more pledges , but rather to figure out how to disburse the $ 14 billion -lrb- € 11.39 billion -rrb- pledged at a donors ' conference in madrid last year . past pledges saleh urged donors to live up to their past pledges .
only a few hundred million dollars have so far been spent .
" assistance and aid in the short term is the key to destroying the causes of terrorism , " saleh said .
" it is also the only way we can build a sustainable , long-term future for our people . " he urged countries that were holding back on " political or geopolitical grounds " not to delay their support , and noted that " the images of calamity and carnage that you see on television screens do not reflect the reality of iraq .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

several nato members have criticized the fact that the two forces operate independently of one another .
german support for combat not likely struck said germany generally supported the nato initiative to increase its troops and expand its area of deployment , but he doubted his country 's parliament would support a change of its mandate to allow its troops to take on a combat mission .
with some 2,500 soldiers , germany is the largest contributor to the isaf peacekeeping mission .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement . " struck also welcomed us democratic presidential candidate john kerry 's call for an international summit on iraq . kerry has maintained during his campaign for the presidency that he would have more success getting traditional us allies and iraq war opponents like germany and france to help in iraq .
in a debate last month with president george w. bush , kerry said that if elected he would call for a summit on iraq .
" this is a very sensible proposal , " struck said .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference . "
official denial the comment makes struck the first member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to hint that a rethink on germany 's official stance on the deployment of soldiers in iraq , may be underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a u.s. army base in baqouba , iraq , monday , july 26 , 2004 .
up to now , germany has helped train policemen and soldiers outside of iraq 's borders , but has strictly refused to send troops to the country . german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his firm opposition to deploying troops to iraq , a spokesman said , slapping down hints at a change in policy from his defense minister . " to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , he added . struck 's comments have also been played down by the greens , the junior , mainly pacifist , partner in the ruling coalition . green party defense expert winfried nachtwei told german television station zdf he assumed struck meant that there would be no deployment of german soldiers to iraq " really , in the foreseeable future . "

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars .

unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany opposes us plan in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mandate is to stabilize afghanistan not fight terrorism at a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania on wednesday , germany objected to washington 's proposal for nato forces to take over the us military mission in afghanistan as part of next year 's reorganization efforts . german defense minister peter struck , who met nato counterparts including us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for informal talks in romania , told reporters he opposed the proposal to integrate the nato peacekeeping force in afghanistan within the 18,000 strong us-led combat mission fighting remnants of the taliban and al qaeda .
nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldier on patrol in kabul while isaf is primary involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts , the separate us mission " operation enduring freedom " includes heavily armed units fighting suspected militants and terrorists , notably on the pakistan border in the southeastern part of the country .
several nato members have criticized the fact that the two forces operate independently of one another .
german support for combat not likely struck said germany generally supported the nato initiative to increase its troops and expand its area of deployment , but he doubted his country 's parliament would support a change of its mandate to allow its troops to take on a combat mission .
with some 2,500 soldiers , germany is the largest contributor to the isaf peacekeeping mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan " i will not accept that germany continues to be heavily engaged in afghanistan while others , despite their pledges , have held back from doing the same , " struck told the gathering of 26 defense ministers " i do not believe that the german government will be prepared to deploy its current 2,500 soldiers in a fight against terrorism .
we would prefer to continue using them for reconstruction efforts , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us blames europe for failures in afghanistan with the clock ticking on crucial presidential polls in afghanistan next month , the us congress has blasted european nations for not sending enough troops to bolster security in the volatile country .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

back in 1968 , a so-called " ruhr development program " aimed to improve the region 's infrastructure was started .
currently , the " goal 2 program 2002-2006 " represents yet another attempt to infuse life into dying cities . together with the european union , the state has set aside almost € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- to help fund companies working in six " fields of excellence , " including logistics , life sciences , micro systems and energy technology . small firms can especially profit from the program , said hartmut weigelt of the life technologies ruhr network , who helps identify fund-worthy projects at universities and in the private sector . a never-ending process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biomedical companies often lack the money to proceed with projects the money can help companies to set up new production technologies , especially in the biomedical sector , weigelt said , adding that the program aims to finance new projects that might not take off otherwise because of high economic risks . economic experts said the program is a step in the right direction . " structural change is not something that you can do and then you 're done with it , " said christoph schmidt , president of the rwi economic research institute .
" it has to go on , you have to keep adding things to be able to compete internationally .
that 's why it 's the right thing to focus on research and education , on new technologies , on scientific transfer . " bureaucratic hurdles but bureaucratic hurdles have prevented many companies from seeking funds so far , weigelt said : approval can take up to two years and applicants have to have matching funds - a problem for many german companies . " we have a structural problem , " weigelt said , adding that there 's a need to come up with financing mechanisms to raise a company 's equity share so that it can apply for funding . some success stories north rhine-westphalia is trying to do just that : the state is willing to vouch for up to 80 percent of bank credits .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany 's school of hard knocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students often need extra help in germany germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .
but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

" there is no intention to punish , " he added .
" germany 's task is simply to comply with eu rules . " but germany could face hefty fines if it loses the case in front of the court .
a decision is unlikely to come soon , however , as the court usually takes about two years to issue a verdict . vw has nothing to say a volkswagen spokesman at the company 's headquarters in wolfsburg , germany declined to comment on the commission 's action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany 's school of hard knocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students often need extra help in germany germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .
but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is . " had i finished off france in ' 39 , then world history would have taken another course , " hitler says in german , alternating between rapid and slow speech and pausing frequently .
" but then i had to wait until 1940 . " hitler laments two-front war " then a two-front war , that was bad luck .
after that , even we were broken , " hitler says , explaining the setbacks of his campaign to conquer the soviet union to c.g.e. mannerheim , commander of the finnish forces during world war ii . the recording was made in secret on the evening of june 4 , 1942 , when hitler made a surprise visit to finland to congratulate the german ally on his 75th birthday . " that he came to finland was a political move , " said ohto manninen , professor of war history at finland 's national defense college .
" he wanted finland to remain in the war on germany 's side . " in 1941 , finland allied itself with nazi germany and attacked the soviet union just days after hitler launched his campaign against stalin , to regain territories lost to moscow in the winter war of 1939-41 . finnish alliance in war against red army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish troops aided the nazis in the siege of leningrad .
in 1942 , germany had 200,000 soldiers based in finland .
together the two allies grabbed large areas in northwestern russia and besieged saint petersburg , then called leningrad .
with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .
" yle was however allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container , " vihonen added , pointing to a cardboard box with the remains of several red wax seals on it . führer rues taking on the soviets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recording , which lasts for 18 minutes , ends abruptly in mid-sentence as hitler explains why it had been difficult to help finland more in their common war against stalin . " we did n't know ourselves just how monstrous this powerful beast was , " hitler says .
" had i known , i would have been more reluctant , but i had already made the decision then , and there would be no other possibility , " he added . yle radio is scheduled to broadcast the tape in its entirety with an accompanying documentary on oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany 's school of hard knocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students often need extra help in germany germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .
but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldier on patrol in kabul while isaf is primary involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts , the separate us mission " operation enduring freedom " includes heavily armed units fighting suspected militants and terrorists , notably on the pakistan border in the southeastern part of the country .
several nato members have criticized the fact that the two forces operate independently of one another .
german support for combat not likely struck said germany generally supported the nato initiative to increase its troops and expand its area of deployment , but he doubted his country 's parliament would support a change of its mandate to allow its troops to take on a combat mission .
with some 2,500 soldiers , germany is the largest contributor to the isaf peacekeeping mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan " i will not accept that germany continues to be heavily engaged in afghanistan while others , despite their pledges , have held back from doing the same , " struck told the gathering of 26 defense ministers " i do not believe that the german government will be prepared to deploy its current 2,500 soldiers in a fight against terrorism .
we would prefer to continue using them for reconstruction efforts , " he concluded . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us blames europe for failures in afghanistan with the clock ticking on crucial presidential polls in afghanistan next month , the us congress has blasted european nations for not sending enough troops to bolster security in the volatile country .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is .

only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany 's school of hard knocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students often need extra help in germany germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .
but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .
an annual oecd report suggested that germany spends too little on learning , students get too little instruction and too few people get university degrees .
-lrb- sept .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "

at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .

" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement . " struck also welcomed us democratic presidential candidate john kerry 's call for an international summit on iraq . kerry has maintained during his campaign for the presidency that he would have more success getting traditional us allies and iraq war opponents like germany and france to help in iraq .
in a debate last month with president george w. bush , kerry said that if elected he would call for a summit on iraq .
" this is a very sensible proposal , " struck said .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference . "
official denial the comment makes struck the first member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to hint that a rethink on germany 's official stance on the deployment of soldiers in iraq , may be underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a u.s. army base in baqouba , iraq , monday , july 26 , 2004 .
up to now , germany has helped train policemen and soldiers outside of iraq 's borders , but has strictly refused to send troops to the country . german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his firm opposition to deploying troops to iraq , a spokesman said , slapping down hints at a change in policy from his defense minister . " to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , he added . struck 's comments have also been played down by the greens , the junior , mainly pacifist , partner in the ruling coalition . green party defense expert winfried nachtwei told german television station zdf he assumed struck meant that there would be no deployment of german soldiers to iraq " really , in the foreseeable future . "
the comment was just an acknowledgement that no one knows what the case could be in five years , nachtwei said . germany , who along with france was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led war in iraq , has categorically refused to send soldiers to iraq .
it has also ruled out sending soldiers there as part of a nato-led training program for iraqi soldiers . berlin however is currently training iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates as well as offered the use of some of its bases in bavaria to train iraqi military recruits .
it has also agreed to deliver 20 armored vehicles to iraq . urgent call for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq deputy prime minister barham saleh , right , delivers a speech at an iraq donors meeting in tokyo , wednesday , oct.13 , 2004 .
meanwhile , at a two-day donors ' conference in tokyo aimed at assessing how to spend billions of dollars in aid pledged to the war-shattered nation , an iraqi official pleaded for greater involvement by the international community . interim deputy prime minister barham saleh told representatives of some 55 countries and organizations that donors should waive the debt from the rule of saddam hussein , and that the united nations should play a more active role in iraq . germany , along with italy and russia , is backing a french proposal for an immediate write off of 50 percent of iraqi debt . the meeting aims not to raise more pledges , but rather to figure out how to disburse the $ 14 billion -lrb- € 11.39 billion -rrb- pledged at a donors ' conference in madrid last year . past pledges saleh urged donors to live up to their past pledges .
only a few hundred million dollars have so far been spent .
" assistance and aid in the short term is the key to destroying the causes of terrorism , " saleh said .
" it is also the only way we can build a sustainable , long-term future for our people . " he urged countries that were holding back on " political or geopolitical grounds " not to delay their support , and noted that " the images of calamity and carnage that you see on television screens do not reflect the reality of iraq . "
germany pledged more than € 100 million to iraq , about 50 million of that through european union funds , to which france also contributes . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence chief warns of chaos in iraq the head of german intelligence warned the fighting in iraq could lead the country to chaos , making it a haven for terrorists affiliated with osama bin laden - who is still alive and active .

" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement . " struck also welcomed us democratic presidential candidate john kerry 's call for an international summit on iraq . kerry has maintained during his campaign for the presidency that he would have more success getting traditional us allies and iraq war opponents like germany and france to help in iraq .
in a debate last month with president george w. bush , kerry said that if elected he would call for a summit on iraq .
" this is a very sensible proposal , " struck said .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference . "
official denial the comment makes struck the first member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to hint that a rethink on germany 's official stance on the deployment of soldiers in iraq , may be underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a u.s. army base in baqouba , iraq , monday , july 26 , 2004 .
up to now , germany has helped train policemen and soldiers outside of iraq 's borders , but has strictly refused to send troops to the country . german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his firm opposition to deploying troops to iraq , a spokesman said , slapping down hints at a change in policy from his defense minister . " to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , he added . struck 's comments have also been played down by the greens , the junior , mainly pacifist , partner in the ruling coalition . green party defense expert winfried nachtwei told german television station zdf he assumed struck meant that there would be no deployment of german soldiers to iraq " really , in the foreseeable future . "
the comment was just an acknowledgement that no one knows what the case could be in five years , nachtwei said . germany , who along with france was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led war in iraq , has categorically refused to send soldiers to iraq .
it has also ruled out sending soldiers there as part of a nato-led training program for iraqi soldiers . berlin however is currently training iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates as well as offered the use of some of its bases in bavaria to train iraqi military recruits .
it has also agreed to deliver 20 armored vehicles to iraq . urgent call for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq deputy prime minister barham saleh , right , delivers a speech at an iraq donors meeting in tokyo , wednesday , oct.13 , 2004 .
meanwhile , at a two-day donors ' conference in tokyo aimed at assessing how to spend billions of dollars in aid pledged to the war-shattered nation , an iraqi official pleaded for greater involvement by the international community . interim deputy prime minister barham saleh told representatives of some 55 countries and organizations that donors should waive the debt from the rule of saddam hussein , and that the united nations should play a more active role in iraq . germany , along with italy and russia , is backing a french proposal for an immediate write off of 50 percent of iraqi debt . the meeting aims not to raise more pledges , but rather to figure out how to disburse the $ 14 billion -lrb- € 11.39 billion -rrb- pledged at a donors ' conference in madrid last year . past pledges saleh urged donors to live up to their past pledges .
only a few hundred million dollars have so far been spent .
" assistance and aid in the short term is the key to destroying the causes of terrorism , " saleh said .
" it is also the only way we can build a sustainable , long-term future for our people . " he urged countries that were holding back on " political or geopolitical grounds " not to delay their support , and noted that " the images of calamity and carnage that you see on television screens do not reflect the reality of iraq . "

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany opposes us plan in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's mandate is to stabilize afghanistan not fight terrorism at a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania on wednesday , germany objected to washington 's proposal for nato forces to take over the us military mission in afghanistan as part of next year 's reorganization efforts . german defense minister peter struck , who met nato counterparts including us defense secretary donald rumsfeld for informal talks in romania , told reporters he opposed the proposal to integrate the nato peacekeeping force in afghanistan within the 18,000 strong us-led combat mission fighting remnants of the taliban and al qaeda .
nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german isaf soldier on patrol in kabul while isaf is primary involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction efforts , the separate us mission " operation enduring freedom " includes heavily armed units fighting suspected militants and terrorists , notably on the pakistan border in the southeastern part of the country .
several nato members have criticized the fact that the two forces operate independently of one another .
german support for combat not likely struck said germany generally supported the nato initiative to increase its troops and expand its area of deployment , but he doubted his country 's parliament would support a change of its mandate to allow its troops to take on a combat mission .
with some 2,500 soldiers , germany is the largest contributor to the isaf peacekeeping mission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in afghanistan " i will not accept that germany continues to be heavily engaged in afghanistan while others , despite their pledges , have held back from doing the same , " struck told the gathering of 26 defense ministers " i do not believe that the german government will be prepared to deploy its current 2,500 soldiers in a fight against terrorism .

back in 1968 , a so-called " ruhr development program " aimed to improve the region 's infrastructure was started .
currently , the " goal 2 program 2002-2006 " represents yet another attempt to infuse life into dying cities . together with the european union , the state has set aside almost € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- to help fund companies working in six " fields of excellence , " including logistics , life sciences , micro systems and energy technology . small firms can especially profit from the program , said hartmut weigelt of the life technologies ruhr network , who helps identify fund-worthy projects at universities and in the private sector . a never-ending process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biomedical companies often lack the money to proceed with projects the money can help companies to set up new production technologies , especially in the biomedical sector , weigelt said , adding that the program aims to finance new projects that might not take off otherwise because of high economic risks . economic experts said the program is a step in the right direction . " structural change is not something that you can do and then you 're done with it , " said christoph schmidt , president of the rwi economic research institute .
" it has to go on , you have to keep adding things to be able to compete internationally .
that 's why it 's the right thing to focus on research and education , on new technologies , on scientific transfer . " bureaucratic hurdles but bureaucratic hurdles have prevented many companies from seeking funds so far , weigelt said : approval can take up to two years and applicants have to have matching funds - a problem for many german companies . " we have a structural problem , " weigelt said , adding that there 's a need to come up with financing mechanisms to raise a company 's equity share so that it can apply for funding . some success stories north rhine-westphalia is trying to do just that : the state is willing to vouch for up to 80 percent of bank credits .
time is running out to apply for the funds as € 130 million will return to the eu 's new technologies fund in 2006 if they have not been distributed . program officials can point to some success stories , however .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany , italy push ahead on asylum centers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's schröder and italy 's berlusconi in rome on wednesday despite a lukewarm reception in the eu , berlin and rome intend to press ahead with a controversial plan to create holding asylum camps for european-bound migrants in north africa as a means to combat illegal immigration . italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu has described a proposal to set up north african transit camps for illegal immigrants as a humane solution in the fight against human trafficking .
italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement . " struck also welcomed us democratic presidential candidate john kerry 's call for an international summit on iraq . kerry has maintained during his campaign for the presidency that he would have more success getting traditional us allies and iraq war opponents like germany and france to help in iraq .
in a debate last month with president george w. bush , kerry said that if elected he would call for a summit on iraq .
" this is a very sensible proposal , " struck said .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference . "
official denial the comment makes struck the first member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to hint that a rethink on germany 's official stance on the deployment of soldiers in iraq , may be underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a u.s. army base in baqouba , iraq , monday , july 26 , 2004 .
up to now , germany has helped train policemen and soldiers outside of iraq 's borders , but has strictly refused to send troops to the country . german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his firm opposition to deploying troops to iraq , a spokesman said , slapping down hints at a change in policy from his defense minister . " to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , he added . struck 's comments have also been played down by the greens , the junior , mainly pacifist , partner in the ruling coalition . green party defense expert winfried nachtwei told german television station zdf he assumed struck meant that there would be no deployment of german soldiers to iraq " really , in the foreseeable future . "
the comment was just an acknowledgement that no one knows what the case could be in five years , nachtwei said . germany , who along with france was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led war in iraq , has categorically refused to send soldiers to iraq .
it has also ruled out sending soldiers there as part of a nato-led training program for iraqi soldiers . berlin however is currently training iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates as well as offered the use of some of its bases in bavaria to train iraqi military recruits .
it has also agreed to deliver 20 armored vehicles to iraq . urgent call for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq deputy prime minister barham saleh , right , delivers a speech at an iraq donors meeting in tokyo , wednesday , oct.13 , 2004 .
meanwhile , at a two-day donors ' conference in tokyo aimed at assessing how to spend billions of dollars in aid pledged to the war-shattered nation , an iraqi official pleaded for greater involvement by the international community . interim deputy prime minister barham saleh told representatives of some 55 countries and organizations that donors should waive the debt from the rule of saddam hussein , and that the united nations should play a more active role in iraq . germany , along with italy and russia , is backing a french proposal for an immediate write off of 50 percent of iraqi debt . the meeting aims not to raise more pledges , but rather to figure out how to disburse the $ 14 billion -lrb- € 11.39 billion -rrb- pledged at a donors ' conference in madrid last year . past pledges saleh urged donors to live up to their past pledges .
only a few hundred million dollars have so far been spent .
" assistance and aid in the short term is the key to destroying the causes of terrorism , " saleh said .
" it is also the only way we can build a sustainable , long-term future for our people . " he urged countries that were holding back on " political or geopolitical grounds " not to delay their support , and noted that " the images of calamity and carnage that you see on television screens do not reflect the reality of iraq . "
germany pledged more than € 100 million to iraq , about 50 million of that through european union funds , to which france also contributes . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german intelligence chief warns of chaos in iraq the head of german intelligence warned the fighting in iraq could lead the country to chaos , making it a haven for terrorists affiliated with osama bin laden - who is still alive and active .

back in 1968 , a so-called " ruhr development program " aimed to improve the region 's infrastructure was started .
currently , the " goal 2 program 2002-2006 " represents yet another attempt to infuse life into dying cities . together with the european union , the state has set aside almost € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- to help fund companies working in six " fields of excellence , " including logistics , life sciences , micro systems and energy technology . small firms can especially profit from the program , said hartmut weigelt of the life technologies ruhr network , who helps identify fund-worthy projects at universities and in the private sector . a never-ending process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biomedical companies often lack the money to proceed with projects the money can help companies to set up new production technologies , especially in the biomedical sector , weigelt said , adding that the program aims to finance new projects that might not take off otherwise because of high economic risks . economic experts said the program is a step in the right direction . " structural change is not something that you can do and then you 're done with it , " said christoph schmidt , president of the rwi economic research institute .
" it has to go on , you have to keep adding things to be able to compete internationally .
that 's why it 's the right thing to focus on research and education , on new technologies , on scientific transfer . " bureaucratic hurdles but bureaucratic hurdles have prevented many companies from seeking funds so far , weigelt said : approval can take up to two years and applicants have to have matching funds - a problem for many german companies . " we have a structural problem , " weigelt said , adding that there 's a need to come up with financing mechanisms to raise a company 's equity share so that it can apply for funding . some success stories north rhine-westphalia is trying to do just that : the state is willing to vouch for up to 80 percent of bank credits .
time is running out to apply for the funds as € 130 million will return to the eu 's new technologies fund in 2006 if they have not been distributed . program officials can point to some success stories , however .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is . " had i finished off france in ' 39 , then world history would have taken another course , " hitler says in german , alternating between rapid and slow speech and pausing frequently .
" but then i had to wait until 1940 . " hitler laments two-front war " then a two-front war , that was bad luck .
after that , even we were broken , " hitler says , explaining the setbacks of his campaign to conquer the soviet union to c.g.e. mannerheim , commander of the finnish forces during world war ii . the recording was made in secret on the evening of june 4 , 1942 , when hitler made a surprise visit to finland to congratulate the german ally on his 75th birthday . " that he came to finland was a political move , " said ohto manninen , professor of war history at finland 's national defense college .
" he wanted finland to remain in the war on germany 's side .

together the two allies grabbed large areas in northwestern russia and besieged saint petersburg , then called leningrad .
with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

nato 's mandate in afghanistan is to stabilize the country , not to fight international terrorism he said .
" the german government sees its mandate as protecting and helping , not fighting , " struck added .
" therefore , we are against a merger of the two mandates . "
nicholas burns , the us ambassador to nato , said the aim of the united states is to combine the two missions under a single alliance commander , possibly as early as 2005 .
" it 's a very complicated issue , " burns said .
" that 's the direction the alliance has been heading for many months now , " he added and hinted to reporters that the proposal would find several supporters in the near future .
new role for nato ?
nato is in need of a reorganization in afghanistan , burns said .
the transatlantic alliance has been in command of the 8,000-strong international security and assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan since last year , but has struggled to drum up the troop numbers needed to expand the un-mandated force outside of kabul .
the alliance 's weakness was particularly evident in the run-up to last week 's presidential elections when nato members only reluctantly relented to supplying more troops .
nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said although the alliance had succeeded in guaranteeing a peaceful election environment , there was still a good deal more to do in afghanistan .
the united states , which provides the biggest number of troops in the war-torn country , has been pushing its european allies to commit more resources and to expand into western afghanistan , where war lords and armed factions of the taliban still hold sway .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .
it was for instance recently used by actor bruno ganz , who has won praise for his portrayal of hitler in the newly released german movie " the downfall . " the low pitch of the voice on the recording may sound unfamiliar , but the message leaves no doubt who the speaker is . " had i finished off france in ' 39 , then world history would have taken another course , " hitler says in german , alternating between rapid and slow speech and pausing frequently .
" but then i had to wait until 1940 . " hitler laments two-front war " then a two-front war , that was bad luck .
after that , even we were broken , " hitler says , explaining the setbacks of his campaign to conquer the soviet union to c.g.e. mannerheim , commander of the finnish forces during world war ii . the recording was made in secret on the evening of june 4 , 1942 , when hitler made a surprise visit to finland to congratulate the german ally on his 75th birthday . " that he came to finland was a political move , " said ohto manninen , professor of war history at finland 's national defense college .
" he wanted finland to remain in the war on germany 's side . " in 1941 , finland allied itself with nazi germany and attacked the soviet union just days after hitler launched his campaign against stalin , to regain territories lost to moscow in the winter war of 1939-41 . finnish alliance in war against red army bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finnish troops aided the nazis in the siege of leningrad .
in 1942 , germany had 200,000 soldiers based in finland .
together the two allies grabbed large areas in northwestern russia and besieged saint petersburg , then called leningrad .
with his forces stretched thin all over europe , it was essential for hitler to keep finland in the war , even though finnish goals had already been met . the tape , mostly a rambling monologue by the nazi dictator , gives a rare glimpse into hitler 's personality , since he had forbidden any recordings of his private conversations .
only hitler 's carefully staged speeches in which he talks in a well-rehearsed , high-pitched and feverish voice were supposed to be saved for posterity . while yle 's recording remained under lock and key for nearly 15 years after it was made , the tape has since been frequently used by actors , journalists and historians in their work . according to manninen , finland 's most respected war historian , the tape however has little value for scholars . " for a person who would like to know hitler better , this recording is important , but it does n't tell us historians anything new that we do not already know from other sources , " manninen said . hitler unaware of recording the tape was made by yle sound engineer thor damen , who was responsible for recording the speeches at mannerheim 's birthday party .
unbeknownst to both the finnish marshal and hitler , damen continued to tape their private conversation after the official part of the program was over , vihonen said . " when the german security officers found out , it really became a scene , with them threatening to kill damen and ordering him to destroy the tape , " he said .
" yle was however allowed to keep the reel after promising to keep it in a sealed container , " vihonen added , pointing to a cardboard box with the remains of several red wax seals on it . führer rues taking on the soviets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recording , which lasts for 18 minutes , ends abruptly in mid-sentence as hitler explains why it had been difficult to help finland more in their common war against stalin . " we did n't know ourselves just how monstrous this powerful beast was , " hitler says .
" had i known , i would have been more reluctant , but i had already made the decision then , and there would be no other possibility , " he added . yle radio is scheduled to broadcast the tape in its entirety with an accompanying documentary on oct .

" this recording is really unique , " lasse vihonen , head of the sound archives at finnish public broadcaster yle , told afp .
" it is the only one in existence where hitler speaks freely . " the tape is a treasure trove for actors rendering the intimate side of the nazi dictator .

back in 1968 , a so-called " ruhr development program " aimed to improve the region 's infrastructure was started .
currently , the " goal 2 program 2002-2006 " represents yet another attempt to infuse life into dying cities . together with the european union , the state has set aside almost € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.46 billion -rrb- to help fund companies working in six " fields of excellence , " including logistics , life sciences , micro systems and energy technology . small firms can especially profit from the program , said hartmut weigelt of the life technologies ruhr network , who helps identify fund-worthy projects at universities and in the private sector . a never-ending process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biomedical companies often lack the money to proceed with projects the money can help companies to set up new production technologies , especially in the biomedical sector , weigelt said , adding that the program aims to finance new projects that might not take off otherwise because of high economic risks . economic experts said the program is a step in the right direction . " structural change is not something that you can do and then you 're done with it , " said christoph schmidt , president of the rwi economic research institute .
" it has to go on , you have to keep adding things to be able to compete internationally .
that 's why it 's the right thing to focus on research and education , on new technologies , on scientific transfer . " bureaucratic hurdles but bureaucratic hurdles have prevented many companies from seeking funds so far , weigelt said : approval can take up to two years and applicants have to have matching funds - a problem for many german companies . " we have a structural problem , " weigelt said , adding that there 's a need to come up with financing mechanisms to raise a company 's equity share so that it can apply for funding . some success stories north rhine-westphalia is trying to do just that : the state is willing to vouch for up to 80 percent of bank credits .
time is running out to apply for the funds as € 130 million will return to the eu 's new technologies fund in 2006 if they have not been distributed . program officials can point to some success stories , however .

" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement . " struck also welcomed us democratic presidential candidate john kerry 's call for an international summit on iraq . kerry has maintained during his campaign for the presidency that he would have more success getting traditional us allies and iraq war opponents like germany and france to help in iraq .
in a debate last month with president george w. bush , kerry said that if elected he would call for a summit on iraq .
" this is a very sensible proposal , " struck said .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference . "
official denial the comment makes struck the first member of chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to hint that a rethink on germany 's official stance on the deployment of soldiers in iraq , may be underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a u.s. army base in baqouba , iraq , monday , july 26 , 2004 .
up to now , germany has helped train policemen and soldiers outside of iraq 's borders , but has strictly refused to send troops to the country . german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday renewed his firm opposition to deploying troops to iraq , a spokesman said , slapping down hints at a change in policy from his defense minister . " to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , he added . struck 's comments have also been played down by the greens , the junior , mainly pacifist , partner in the ruling coalition . green party defense expert winfried nachtwei told german television station zdf he assumed struck meant that there would be no deployment of german soldiers to iraq " really , in the foreseeable future . "
the comment was just an acknowledgement that no one knows what the case could be in five years , nachtwei said . germany , who along with france was one of the most vocal opponents of the us-led war in iraq , has categorically refused to send soldiers to iraq .
it has also ruled out sending soldiers there as part of a nato-led training program for iraqi soldiers . berlin however is currently training iraqi police officers in the united arab emirates as well as offered the use of some of its bases in bavaria to train iraqi military recruits .
it has also agreed to deliver 20 armored vehicles to iraq . urgent call for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraq deputy prime minister barham saleh , right , delivers a speech at an iraq donors meeting in tokyo , wednesday , oct.13 , 2004 .
meanwhile , at a two-day donors ' conference in tokyo aimed at assessing how to spend billions of dollars in aid pledged to the war-shattered nation , an iraqi official pleaded for greater involvement by the international community . interim deputy prime minister barham saleh told representatives of some 55 countries and organizations that donors should waive the debt from the rule of saddam hussein , and that the united nations should play a more active role in iraq . germany , along with italy and russia , is backing a french proposal for an immediate write off of 50 percent of iraqi debt . the meeting aims not to raise more pledges , but rather to figure out how to disburse the $ 14 billion -lrb- € 11.39 billion -rrb- pledged at a donors ' conference in madrid last year . past pledges saleh urged donors to live up to their past pledges .
only a few hundred million dollars have so far been spent .
" assistance and aid in the short term is the key to destroying the causes of terrorism , " saleh said .
" it is also the only way we can build a sustainable , long-term future for our people . " he urged countries that were holding back on " political or geopolitical grounds " not to delay their support , and noted that " the images of calamity and carnage that you see on television screens do not reflect the reality of iraq .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .
" i do n't think they can be called concentration camps . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a boat carrying would-be immigrants from africa docks at lampedusa island 's harbour , south of sicily .
pisanu admitted the proposal was " controversial " and would have to be closely examined " so as to fully explain it to those who are concerned about it . "
at the same time he said europe can not ignore the growing number of illegal immigrants knocking on its doors .
a european problem " there are countries who have not yet been invaded by illegal immigrants and which think there 's no problem .
they 're wrong because sooner or later illegal immigrants will arrive in their countries as well , " pisanu argued .
" clandestine immigration will double in the next 50 years and will even concern the extreme north of europe .
that 's why it 's wise to confront the problem straight away , " said the minister .
" immigration is a european-wide problem , " pisanu said , a view german chancellor gerhard schröder is also likely to stress during his talks with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi later on wednesday .
the issue is expected to be a topic of discussion at the end of the week when interior ministers from germany , france , spain and great britain converge in florence for two days of discussions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy resumes controversial deportations italy resumed the forced expulsions of illegal immigrants from the remote mediterranean island of lampedusa on wednesday , brushing aside criticism from human rights groups .

italy , which has been swamped by a recent wave of would-be asylum seekers landing on its southern shores , has joined forces with germany to hammer out a plan for combating what the two governments see as a major european issue .
addressing foreign journalists in rome ahead of a meeting with his german counterpart on wednesday , pisanu likened illegal immigration to the slave trade for its dangers and brutality .
the minister said the issue had a high priority because human traffickers had no qualms about endangering the lives of the european-bound migrants by selling them one-way tickets on rickety boats that often ca n't make it across the mediterranean .
the proposal to create transit camps in libya for processing immigrants before they headed for europe was first brought up by german interior minister otto schily after a german aid relief ship full of african refugees was stranded on the italian island of lampedusa in august .
combatting illegal immigration aware that the proposal has met with criticism from human rights groups and other eu member states , particularly france and spain , the italian minister made clear that the detention centers can in no way be described as " concentration camps , " as they have often been referred to in past discussions .
" the idea of creating reception centers for immigration candidates is one of the measures in the campaign against illegal immigration , " the minister said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2004 germany 's school of hard knocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign students often need extra help in germany germany has long sought to bring the world 's best students to the country 's universities .
but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

but unfortunately most foreigners leave without receiving a degree .
even worse , many never even manage to enroll in classes . studying abroad is n't easy .
besides attempting to do well at university , a foreigner often has to master a new language while trying to fit into a strange culture .
those are challenges similar around the world .
but there is growing criticism that the educational system in germany is failing to properly select and prepare prospective students from abroad . according to a recent study by the non-profit his higher education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to even enroll , unable to pass the university 's entry exams . " we really need to develop another system for picking students , " dr. jochen hellmann , director of the university of hamburg 's international programs , told dw-world .
" we need to focus less on the qualifications someone may have on paper and instead determine what they are really capable of doing . " much of the demand for reform has focused on germany 's so-called studienkollegs , preparatory institutions that are supposed to help foreigners qualify for study at universities .
besides offering language instruction , they also help students improve their academic deficiencies in specific subjects . not enough students who are unable to enter the german university system directly are often redirected to the studienkollegs for extra help .
however , that assistance often is n't enough .
sadly , there are countless tales of would-be students that spend a year in preparatory classes only to be forced to leave germany after they fail to qualify for university . though they are not charged fees above what a normally enrolled university student would have to pay , those attending a studienkolleg still need to cover their cost of living in germany .
and that can often be quite expensive for prospective students from china , indonesia or other developing countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " after half a year or a year at the studienkolleg they find out it 's all been for nothing .
it 's not a very efficient way of doing things .
it 's almost haphazard , " said hellmann . accordingly , there growing calls from both inside and outside the studienkollegs for reform .
one of the most important suggestions is to give the studienkollegs more discretion and input on the selection process .
instead of simply concentrating on those students that ca n't garner a university spot straight away , they could then focus on choosing those people best suited to succeed in the german higher education system .
currently , a central office sets the criteria for non-eu students who want to study in germany . " in my experience it 's extremely difficult to compare the diplomas of different countries , " harald klingel , head of the university of cologne 's studienkolleg , told dw-world .
" being more involved in the selection could help weed out those that maybe do n't really belong here , but it could also improve how we help others that do . " testing abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one option being discussed is increasing the number of students that are tested before they even leave their home countries .
currently there is one privately funded institution abroad that offers recognized instruction and testing .
associated with the university of hanover , the german international school in jakarta , indonesia just graduated its second class of studienkolleg participants . dr ekkehard zeeb , the school 's director , said the program was started on the private initiative of indonesians after they learned how many of their students were failing to qualify for spots at german universities .
the indonesian embassy in berlin has estimated that around two thirds of all indonesians that come to germany to study leave without managing to enroll at a university . zeeb said although the 12 prospective students in indonesia had to pay an estimated € 3,600 -lrb- $ 4,456 -rrb- to cover tuition costs , the program often worked out to be cheaper than spending time at a studienkolleg in germany .
" that may sound like a lot , but not if you compare the cost of living in indonesia to what it is in germany , " zeeb told dw-world in a telephone interview from jakarta . klingel , who is also the chairman of the national studienkolleg directorate , said he saw advantages to increasing the level of overseas testing and training , but he also cautioned that approach had disadvantages as well . " besides preparing students linguistically and academically , the studienkollegs are also supposed to help them integrate into german society , " he said .
" that can clearly only be done here . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bad grades for german schools germany ’ s school system has gotten bad marks yet again .

mr chen used a speech on sunday to urge beijing to agree to talks to resolve tensions over the build-up of weapons between the two rivals .
but china has dismissed his " false overtures " and said his " separatist " plans risked a " great catastrophe " .
beijing has repeatedly pledged to invade if taiwan declares independence .
" if chen shui-bian remains bent on sticking to his splittist and taiwan independence activities , he will never bring peace and prosperity to the taiwan compatriots , but will only bring great catastrophe , " said china 's taiwan affairs office spokesman zhang mingqing on wednesday .
" taiwan independence is the biggest danger to peace and stability across the taiwan strait and the asian region . "
the bbc 's louisa lim in beijing says the statement underlines the lack of trust between the two sides .
chen made conciliatory noises towards china in his speech , president chen asserted the island of taiwan was a sovereign nation .
tensions have been high since mr chen was re-elected to a second term in march .
the us state department welcomed mr chen 's speech as constructive , prompting beijing to ask america to stop sending the island the wrong message .
china has more than 600 ballistic missiles pointed at the island and is adding 60 to 70 new missiles each year .
taiwan , which broke with the new communist state in 1949 , is locked in a debate over whether to strengthen its defences even further with us military aid .

his body has never been recovered but his family wish to celebrate his life with friends .
donations the newlyn and lizard lifeboats spent hours searching for the 30ft netter , which did not have an emergency satellite beacon .
staff from the newlyn branch of the royal national mission to deep sea fishermen have been helping the family cope with their loss .
the family has requested that donations in lieu of flowers go the penlee branch of the rnli and to the royal national mission to deep sea fishermen .

" he always had a smile on his face and was always willing to give you a hand .
" he would never walk past a struggling fisherman .
