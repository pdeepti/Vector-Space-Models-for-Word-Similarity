for him , it typifies the gradual decline of the black forest , one of germany 's biggest tourist draws . " that 's the most visible effect of pollution .
the trees began yellowing in autumn and have progressively lost their needles , " says the researcher from the german fva forestry office , which supervises the black forest . black forest badly damaged the agriculture ministry too acknowledges the problem has become acute .
in a report this month , it said that germany 's woodlands have never been in such bad shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in four trees is damaged , and the number of those worst hit has increased by eight percent over the last year , the report said .
the development is particularly disturbing in the black forest , which is considered to be 40 percent " damaged " , the worst attrition rate since 1983 . the number of unhealthy trees in this southwest corner of germany near the french border has risen by 10 percent over 2003 , due in part to a drought last year whose effects are being felt with some delay . pollution the culprit " you ca n't just turn a blind eye .
the black forest has been historically weakened , above all here on the western edges where the wind brings in pollutants from the rhine valley , " says wilpert . with a turn of the breeze , the soil can be contaminated with nitrates , ammonium , nitrogen and acids from industry and traffic in the valley . pollution 's first victims are the spruce and beech , shallow rooted trees which absorb elements closer to the surface of the soil .
the problem is even more pronounced on the other side of germany , where waste from heavy industry in poland and the czech republic wafts over woodland . self-made problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the fva is singling out the rhine river basin here , it does admit some responsibility for the problems by having planted trees from 1950-1970 that were not well adapted to the environment . " the spruce grows quickly .
we made the error of wanting to rapidly grow wood for cutting , " the researcher says , gesturing to a clutch of trees some 10 meters -lrb- 30 feet -rrb- taller than nearby pines planted at the same time . " but it 's a fragile tree and its needles are acidic and add to the pollution in the streams and ground water . " researchers and experts may be assessing the destruction and outlining ways to nurse the ailing woodlands back to health .

father thomas george pattarumadathil will be telling them about christmas in india and giving them insight into his experiences as an assistant parish priest in germany .
pattarumadathil , 37 , is one of many foreign pastors working in germany .
while there are no figures for the exact number of foreign religious workers in germany , most of whom come from eastern europe , india and africa , the catholic and protestant churches agree their help is appreciated .
filling a gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian priests are used to different conditions when preaching at home " foreign priests are welcome to help with pastoral care , " said stefanie uphues , a spokeswoman for the german bishops conference .
" it 's not easy for them , especially when the church and community structure differ from their experience at home . "
though the process may not be easy , there are still people like pattarumadathil who come to preach in germany , and fill gaps left by the dwindling number of germans entering the priesthood .
" there are many places , especially in rural areas , that would not be able to hold sunday services without foreign priests , " said reinhard kürzinger , a cathedral vicar in bavaria 's eichstätt diocese , who has directed a program that has been training foreign priests to work in germany since 1997 .
" many of the priests come from countries where germany used to do missionary work . "
missionizing in the home country but now germany itself has practically become a country in need of missionary work .
the german catholic church , which has about 26 million members , ordained 130 priests in 2003 , one less than 2002 , continuing a general downward trend .
the number of priests here has been on the decline for the past 15 years , with the amount of active catholic priests falling 20 percent since 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pastors are at work in catholic as well as protestant churches in germany foreign pastors are also at work in germany 's protestant church , which also counts about 26 million members .
but unlike the catholic church , there is no program to encourage them to work in german congregations , according to christof vetter , a german protestant church spokesman .
foreigners part of pastoral team recognizing the increasing need for foreign religious workers , kürzinger recently drew up guidelines to help dioceses looking to use foreign priests .
he outlined what the church needs to do to ensure that the foreigners fit into their congregation and what assistance their german mentors should provide .
in most cases , foreign priests do not work independently but as part of a pastoral team and stay in germany for between five and seven years .
language often a problem making sure parishioners can understand the foreign priests is one of the main tasks for the churches .
but , being able to speak german is sometimes not enough .
the dialects spoken in parts of the country can seem indecipherable even to priests who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a declining number of germans going into the priesthood , the country 's dioceses are looking abroad for help " my german is good , and i can speak without thinking about each word , but i can still make improvements to my grammar , " said pattarumadathil , who has been in germany for three years and receives language courses from the eichstätt diocese .
" people here are patient with me and have made me feel really comfortable . "
in addition to language lessons , the priests also get tips on how to approach german parishioners and what church members expect of priests .
" the essence of the liturgy here is the same , but the cultural and traditional differences make it very different from india , " pattarumadathil said .
" but people have been patient , and i feel like i 'm at home here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2004 gap growing between poor and rich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer a problem confined to the developing world a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it . the gap between the rich and poor in germany has drastically increased since 1998 when the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens took over from its conservative predecessors .
that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .
some 1.6 million germans own at least half a million euros each , and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : poverty in germany set to rise social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes .

poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .
some 1.6 million germans own at least half a million euros each , and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : poverty in germany set to rise social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes .

a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2004 gap growing between poor and rich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer a problem confined to the developing world a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it . the gap between the rich and poor in germany has drastically increased since 1998 when the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens took over from its conservative predecessors .
that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .
some 1.6 million germans own at least half a million euros each , and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : poverty in germany set to rise social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes .
-lrb- july 8 , 2004 -rrb- thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms .

that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .
some 1.6 million germans own at least half a million euros each , and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : poverty in germany set to rise social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes .

many a reveller gets into the spirit at one of the country 's omnipresent christmas markets . christmas time in germany means decorated trees , gifts , strings of colored lights and supermarket loudspeakers blaring carols .
that might not seem very different from christmas time in the rest of western hemisphere .
but , it 's the christmas markets that stand out in germany . mulled wine , music , and cold feet : you could say , that 's what 's special about christmas markets in germany .
a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .
the cathedral ’ s towers , reaching some 150 meters into the clear winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around two million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" they are n't the top -lrb- cologne tourist -rrb- attraction , " merfeld explained .
" for that we have the 2006 soccer world cup , next year 's world youth day and , of course , cologne 's carnival .
but the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights . " centuries ' old tradition wooden signs above the stalls state what 's on offer - anything from silver jewelry and wooden toys to christmas stollen , a cake typical of the season .
and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .
little old ladies use walking sticks to make their way through the crowd ; young mothers navigate prams with a grim determination through the narrow aisles ; and families huddle together with a warm drink - glühwein for the parents - for a brief respite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mulled wine , glühwein , is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwein .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff . besides the obligatory sausage , christmas market visitors can gorge on reibekuchen , potato pancakes served with apple sauce .
though nowadays tradition has made way for chinese chop suey , mexican burritos and other non-german specialties . christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .

" the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said . after all , christmas markets are n't really about glühwein , reibekuchen or buying useless things - they 're about coming together in anticipation of the advent of christmas , a season of peace and harmony . andrea rönsberg -lrb- ncy , jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's gingerbread giant at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .

for him , it typifies the gradual decline of the black forest , one of germany 's biggest tourist draws . " that 's the most visible effect of pollution .
the trees began yellowing in autumn and have progressively lost their needles , " says the researcher from the german fva forestry office , which supervises the black forest . black forest badly damaged the agriculture ministry too acknowledges the problem has become acute .
in a report this month , it said that germany 's woodlands have never been in such bad shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in four trees is damaged , and the number of those worst hit has increased by eight percent over the last year , the report said .
the development is particularly disturbing in the black forest , which is considered to be 40 percent " damaged " , the worst attrition rate since 1983 . the number of unhealthy trees in this southwest corner of germany near the french border has risen by 10 percent over 2003 , due in part to a drought last year whose effects are being felt with some delay . pollution the culprit " you ca n't just turn a blind eye .
the black forest has been historically weakened , above all here on the western edges where the wind brings in pollutants from the rhine valley , " says wilpert . with a turn of the breeze , the soil can be contaminated with nitrates , ammonium , nitrogen and acids from industry and traffic in the valley . pollution 's first victims are the spruce and beech , shallow rooted trees which absorb elements closer to the surface of the soil .
the problem is even more pronounced on the other side of germany , where waste from heavy industry in poland and the czech republic wafts over woodland . self-made problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the fva is singling out the rhine river basin here , it does admit some responsibility for the problems by having planted trees from 1950-1970 that were not well adapted to the environment . " the spruce grows quickly .
we made the error of wanting to rapidly grow wood for cutting , " the researcher says , gesturing to a clutch of trees some 10 meters -lrb- 30 feet -rrb- taller than nearby pines planted at the same time . " but it 's a fragile tree and its needles are acidic and add to the pollution in the streams and ground water . " researchers and experts may be assessing the destruction and outlining ways to nurse the ailing woodlands back to health .

" eu leaders agreed at a summit in brussels last week to open membership negotiations with ankara on october 3 , but set a series of tough conditions and made clear that turkey could not hope to join the eu before 2014 . all 25 eu member states must ratify the constitution , which aims to streamline the workings of the bloc , before it can go into effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey sobers up after eu dream brussels ’ announcement of a date to start eu membership talks comes as a relief to tukey , after the issue of cyprus threatened to derail negotiations .

" a letter from the minister authorizing the extradition was sent on october 31 , " patrick charette , a spokesman for canada 's justice ministry , told news agency afp thursday .
but he said that schreiber in november lodged a challenge to the minister 's decision with the court of appeal in the canadian province of ontario which will be heard next year .
ontario 's superior court had originally okayed the extradition of schreiber , who has waged a long legal battle to avoid being sent back to germany .
but schreiber also appealed that setback , and now both legal tracks will be examined by the ontario court of appeal .
even if that body approves his expulsion from canada , he still has recourse to appeal to the federal supreme court .
schreiber was arrested in toronto in 1999 , on a german warrant alleging tax evasion , corruption , bribery and breach of trust .
the german government has alleged that schreiber did not pay any income tax on around 20 million canadian dollars -lrb- € 12 million , 14.4 million us -rrb- he received between 1988 and 1993 .
he is also accused of bribing government officials in germany to facilitate a 325 million dollar sale of tanks to saudi arabia in 1991 . dw-world.de fugitive german defense official arrested for bribery french police on tuesday apprehended holger pfahls , who served as deputy defense minister from 1989 to 1992 .

" a letter from the minister authorizing the extradition was sent on october 31 , " patrick charette , a spokesman for canada 's justice ministry , told news agency afp thursday .
but he said that schreiber in november lodged a challenge to the minister 's decision with the court of appeal in the canadian province of ontario which will be heard next year .
ontario 's superior court had originally okayed the extradition of schreiber , who has waged a long legal battle to avoid being sent back to germany .
but schreiber also appealed that setback , and now both legal tracks will be examined by the ontario court of appeal .
even if that body approves his expulsion from canada , he still has recourse to appeal to the federal supreme court .
schreiber was arrested in toronto in 1999 , on a german warrant alleging tax evasion , corruption , bribery and breach of trust .
the german government has alleged that schreiber did not pay any income tax on around 20 million canadian dollars -lrb- € 12 million , 14.4 million us -rrb- he received between 1988 and 1993 .
he is also accused of bribing government officials in germany to facilitate a 325 million dollar sale of tanks to saudi arabia in 1991 . dw-world.de fugitive german defense official arrested for bribery french police on tuesday apprehended holger pfahls , who served as deputy defense minister from 1989 to 1992 .

" eu leaders agreed at a summit in brussels last week to open membership negotiations with ankara on october 3 , but set a series of tough conditions and made clear that turkey could not hope to join the eu before 2014 . all 25 eu member states must ratify the constitution , which aims to streamline the workings of the bloc , before it can go into effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey sobers up after eu dream brussels ’ announcement of a date to start eu membership talks comes as a relief to tukey , after the issue of cyprus threatened to derail negotiations .

many a reveller gets into the spirit at one of the country 's omnipresent christmas markets . christmas time in germany means decorated trees , gifts , strings of colored lights and supermarket loudspeakers blaring carols .
that might not seem very different from christmas time in the rest of western hemisphere .
but , it 's the christmas markets that stand out in germany . mulled wine , music , and cold feet : you could say , that 's what 's special about christmas markets in germany .
a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .
the cathedral ’ s towers , reaching some 150 meters into the clear winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around two million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" they are n't the top -lrb- cologne tourist -rrb- attraction , " merfeld explained .
" for that we have the 2006 soccer world cup , next year 's world youth day and , of course , cologne 's carnival .
but the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights . " centuries ' old tradition wooden signs above the stalls state what 's on offer - anything from silver jewelry and wooden toys to christmas stollen , a cake typical of the season .
and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .
little old ladies use walking sticks to make their way through the crowd ; young mothers navigate prams with a grim determination through the narrow aisles ; and families huddle together with a warm drink - glühwein for the parents - for a brief respite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mulled wine , glühwein , is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwein .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff . besides the obligatory sausage , christmas market visitors can gorge on reibekuchen , potato pancakes served with apple sauce .
though nowadays tradition has made way for chinese chop suey , mexican burritos and other non-german specialties . christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
escape the modern day hectic now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuchen is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwein available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening proclamation at nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt - in existence since 1628 though christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago .
" the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said . after all , christmas markets are n't really about glühwein , reibekuchen or buying useless things - they 're about coming together in anticipation of the advent of christmas , a season of peace and harmony . andrea rönsberg -lrb- ncy , jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's gingerbread giant at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .

that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .

for him , it typifies the gradual decline of the black forest , one of germany 's biggest tourist draws . " that 's the most visible effect of pollution .
the trees began yellowing in autumn and have progressively lost their needles , " says the researcher from the german fva forestry office , which supervises the black forest . black forest badly damaged the agriculture ministry too acknowledges the problem has become acute .
in a report this month , it said that germany 's woodlands have never been in such bad shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in four trees is damaged , and the number of those worst hit has increased by eight percent over the last year , the report said .
the development is particularly disturbing in the black forest , which is considered to be 40 percent " damaged " , the worst attrition rate since 1983 . the number of unhealthy trees in this southwest corner of germany near the french border has risen by 10 percent over 2003 , due in part to a drought last year whose effects are being felt with some delay . pollution the culprit " you ca n't just turn a blind eye .
the black forest has been historically weakened , above all here on the western edges where the wind brings in pollutants from the rhine valley , " says wilpert . with a turn of the breeze , the soil can be contaminated with nitrates , ammonium , nitrogen and acids from industry and traffic in the valley . pollution 's first victims are the spruce and beech , shallow rooted trees which absorb elements closer to the surface of the soil .
the problem is even more pronounced on the other side of germany , where waste from heavy industry in poland and the czech republic wafts over woodland . self-made problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the fva is singling out the rhine river basin here , it does admit some responsibility for the problems by having planted trees from 1950-1970 that were not well adapted to the environment . " the spruce grows quickly .
we made the error of wanting to rapidly grow wood for cutting , " the researcher says , gesturing to a clutch of trees some 10 meters -lrb- 30 feet -rrb- taller than nearby pines planted at the same time . " but it 's a fragile tree and its needles are acidic and add to the pollution in the streams and ground water . " researchers and experts may be assessing the destruction and outlining ways to nurse the ailing woodlands back to health .

many a reveller gets into the spirit at one of the country 's omnipresent christmas markets . christmas time in germany means decorated trees , gifts , strings of colored lights and supermarket loudspeakers blaring carols .
that might not seem very different from christmas time in the rest of western hemisphere .
but , it 's the christmas markets that stand out in germany . mulled wine , music , and cold feet : you could say , that 's what 's special about christmas markets in germany .
a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .

and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .

many a reveller gets into the spirit at one of the country 's omnipresent christmas markets . christmas time in germany means decorated trees , gifts , strings of colored lights and supermarket loudspeakers blaring carols .
that might not seem very different from christmas time in the rest of western hemisphere .
but , it 's the christmas markets that stand out in germany . mulled wine , music , and cold feet : you could say , that 's what 's special about christmas markets in germany .
a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .
the cathedral ’ s towers , reaching some 150 meters into the clear winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around two million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" they are n't the top -lrb- cologne tourist -rrb- attraction , " merfeld explained .
" for that we have the 2006 soccer world cup , next year 's world youth day and , of course , cologne 's carnival .
but the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights . " centuries ' old tradition wooden signs above the stalls state what 's on offer - anything from silver jewelry and wooden toys to christmas stollen , a cake typical of the season .
and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .
little old ladies use walking sticks to make their way through the crowd ; young mothers navigate prams with a grim determination through the narrow aisles ; and families huddle together with a warm drink - glühwein for the parents - for a brief respite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mulled wine , glühwein , is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwein .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff . besides the obligatory sausage , christmas market visitors can gorge on reibekuchen , potato pancakes served with apple sauce .
though nowadays tradition has made way for chinese chop suey , mexican burritos and other non-german specialties . christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
escape the modern day hectic now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuchen is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwein available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening proclamation at nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt - in existence since 1628 though christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago .
" the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said . after all , christmas markets are n't really about glühwein , reibekuchen or buying useless things - they 're about coming together in anticipation of the advent of christmas , a season of peace and harmony . andrea rönsberg -lrb- ncy , jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's gingerbread giant at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .

father thomas george pattarumadathil will be telling them about christmas in india and giving them insight into his experiences as an assistant parish priest in germany .
pattarumadathil , 37 , is one of many foreign pastors working in germany .
while there are no figures for the exact number of foreign religious workers in germany , most of whom come from eastern europe , india and africa , the catholic and protestant churches agree their help is appreciated .
filling a gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian priests are used to different conditions when preaching at home " foreign priests are welcome to help with pastoral care , " said stefanie uphues , a spokeswoman for the german bishops conference .
" it 's not easy for them , especially when the church and community structure differ from their experience at home . "
though the process may not be easy , there are still people like pattarumadathil who come to preach in germany , and fill gaps left by the dwindling number of germans entering the priesthood .
" there are many places , especially in rural areas , that would not be able to hold sunday services without foreign priests , " said reinhard kürzinger , a cathedral vicar in bavaria 's eichstätt diocese , who has directed a program that has been training foreign priests to work in germany since 1997 .
" many of the priests come from countries where germany used to do missionary work . "
missionizing in the home country but now germany itself has practically become a country in need of missionary work .
the german catholic church , which has about 26 million members , ordained 130 priests in 2003 , one less than 2002 , continuing a general downward trend .
the number of priests here has been on the decline for the past 15 years , with the amount of active catholic priests falling 20 percent since 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pastors are at work in catholic as well as protestant churches in germany foreign pastors are also at work in germany 's protestant church , which also counts about 26 million members .
but unlike the catholic church , there is no program to encourage them to work in german congregations , according to christof vetter , a german protestant church spokesman .
foreigners part of pastoral team recognizing the increasing need for foreign religious workers , kürzinger recently drew up guidelines to help dioceses looking to use foreign priests .
he outlined what the church needs to do to ensure that the foreigners fit into their congregation and what assistance their german mentors should provide .
in most cases , foreign priests do not work independently but as part of a pastoral team and stay in germany for between five and seven years .
language often a problem making sure parishioners can understand the foreign priests is one of the main tasks for the churches .
but , being able to speak german is sometimes not enough .
the dialects spoken in parts of the country can seem indecipherable even to priests who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a declining number of germans going into the priesthood , the country 's dioceses are looking abroad for help " my german is good , and i can speak without thinking about each word , but i can still make improvements to my grammar , " said pattarumadathil , who has been in germany for three years and receives language courses from the eichstätt diocese .
" people here are patient with me and have made me feel really comfortable . "
in addition to language lessons , the priests also get tips on how to approach german parishioners and what church members expect of priests .
" the essence of the liturgy here is the same , but the cultural and traditional differences make it very different from india , " pattarumadathil said .
" but people have been patient , and i feel like i 'm at home here .

father thomas george pattarumadathil will be telling them about christmas in india and giving them insight into his experiences as an assistant parish priest in germany .
pattarumadathil , 37 , is one of many foreign pastors working in germany .
while there are no figures for the exact number of foreign religious workers in germany , most of whom come from eastern europe , india and africa , the catholic and protestant churches agree their help is appreciated .
filling a gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian priests are used to different conditions when preaching at home " foreign priests are welcome to help with pastoral care , " said stefanie uphues , a spokeswoman for the german bishops conference .
" it 's not easy for them , especially when the church and community structure differ from their experience at home . "
though the process may not be easy , there are still people like pattarumadathil who come to preach in germany , and fill gaps left by the dwindling number of germans entering the priesthood .
" there are many places , especially in rural areas , that would not be able to hold sunday services without foreign priests , " said reinhard kürzinger , a cathedral vicar in bavaria 's eichstätt diocese , who has directed a program that has been training foreign priests to work in germany since 1997 .
" many of the priests come from countries where germany used to do missionary work . "
missionizing in the home country but now germany itself has practically become a country in need of missionary work .
the german catholic church , which has about 26 million members , ordained 130 priests in 2003 , one less than 2002 , continuing a general downward trend .
the number of priests here has been on the decline for the past 15 years , with the amount of active catholic priests falling 20 percent since 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pastors are at work in catholic as well as protestant churches in germany foreign pastors are also at work in germany 's protestant church , which also counts about 26 million members .
but unlike the catholic church , there is no program to encourage them to work in german congregations , according to christof vetter , a german protestant church spokesman .
foreigners part of pastoral team recognizing the increasing need for foreign religious workers , kürzinger recently drew up guidelines to help dioceses looking to use foreign priests .
he outlined what the church needs to do to ensure that the foreigners fit into their congregation and what assistance their german mentors should provide .
in most cases , foreign priests do not work independently but as part of a pastoral team and stay in germany for between five and seven years .
language often a problem making sure parishioners can understand the foreign priests is one of the main tasks for the churches .
but , being able to speak german is sometimes not enough .
the dialects spoken in parts of the country can seem indecipherable even to priests who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a declining number of germans going into the priesthood , the country 's dioceses are looking abroad for help " my german is good , and i can speak without thinking about each word , but i can still make improvements to my grammar , " said pattarumadathil , who has been in germany for three years and receives language courses from the eichstätt diocese .
" people here are patient with me and have made me feel really comfortable . "
in addition to language lessons , the priests also get tips on how to approach german parishioners and what church members expect of priests .
" the essence of the liturgy here is the same , but the cultural and traditional differences make it very different from india , " pattarumadathil said .
" but people have been patient , and i feel like i 'm at home here .

that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .

opinion polls show more than two-thirds of french voters oppose turkey 's entry .
many fear the entry of a large , overwhelmingly muslim country will change the nature of the union and turkish immigrants will flood europe . too populous and poor the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of the main opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will host sarkozy at its annual parliamentary group conference january 6 to discuss turkey 's eu ambitions and its implications for the planned european union constitution , daily rheinische post said . sarkozy will then meet with cdu leaders at a conference in the northern city of kiel , the party has said . while german chancellor gerhard schröder has spearheaded efforts to bring turkey into the eu fold , the christian union parties are lobbying for a " privileged partnership " with ankara as opposed to full membership . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , head of the cdu in germany earlier press reports said that several csu members of parliament were now considering opposing the eu constitution because they argue it would leave the bloc hamstrung if turkey did eventually become a member . csu deputy johannes singhammer told daily münchner merkur that turkey was too populous and too poor for the bloc to take on . door open for eu-turkey talks france is to hold a national referendum on the eu constitution next year and under pressure from sarkozy , french president jacques chirac was forced to promise a referendum on ratifying turkey 's eventual eu membership . in a recent interview on french television , sarkozy said , " if turkey were european , we 'd know it . " eu leaders agreed at a summit in brussels last week to open membership negotiations with ankara on october 3 , but set a series of tough conditions and made clear that turkey could not hope to join the eu before 2014 . all 25 eu member states must ratify the constitution , which aims to streamline the workings of the bloc , before it can go into effect . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey sobers up after eu dream brussels ’ announcement of a date to start eu membership talks comes as a relief to tukey , after the issue of cyprus threatened to derail negotiations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2004 gap growing between poor and rich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer a problem confined to the developing world a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it . the gap between the rich and poor in germany has drastically increased since 1998 when the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens took over from its conservative predecessors .
that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .
some 1.6 million germans own at least half a million euros each , and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : poverty in germany set to rise social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.12.2004 searching for the christmas market pulse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wherever you turn in germany , you 'll find a christmas market the holiday season means more than gifts , music and trees in germany .
many a reveller gets into the spirit at one of the country 's omnipresent christmas markets . christmas time in germany means decorated trees , gifts , strings of colored lights and supermarket loudspeakers blaring carols .
that might not seem very different from christmas time in the rest of western hemisphere .
but , it 's the christmas markets that stand out in germany . mulled wine , music , and cold feet : you could say , that 's what 's special about christmas markets in germany .
a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .
the cathedral ’ s towers , reaching some 150 meters into the clear winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around two million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" they are n't the top -lrb- cologne tourist -rrb- attraction , " merfeld explained .
" for that we have the 2006 soccer world cup , next year 's world youth day and , of course , cologne 's carnival .
but the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights . " centuries ' old tradition wooden signs above the stalls state what 's on offer - anything from silver jewelry and wooden toys to christmas stollen , a cake typical of the season .
and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .
little old ladies use walking sticks to make their way through the crowd ; young mothers navigate prams with a grim determination through the narrow aisles ; and families huddle together with a warm drink - glühwein for the parents - for a brief respite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mulled wine , glühwein , is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwein .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff . besides the obligatory sausage , christmas market visitors can gorge on reibekuchen , potato pancakes served with apple sauce .
though nowadays tradition has made way for chinese chop suey , mexican burritos and other non-german specialties . christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
escape the modern day hectic now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuchen is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwein available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening proclamation at nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt - in existence since 1628 though christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago .
" the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said . after all , christmas markets are n't really about glühwein , reibekuchen or buying useless things - they 're about coming together in anticipation of the advent of christmas , a season of peace and harmony . andrea rönsberg -lrb- ncy , jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's gingerbread giant at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .

but the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights . " centuries ' old tradition wooden signs above the stalls state what 's on offer - anything from silver jewelry and wooden toys to christmas stollen , a cake typical of the season .
and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .
little old ladies use walking sticks to make their way through the crowd ; young mothers navigate prams with a grim determination through the narrow aisles ; and families huddle together with a warm drink - glühwein for the parents - for a brief respite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mulled wine , glühwein , is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwein .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff . besides the obligatory sausage , christmas market visitors can gorge on reibekuchen , potato pancakes served with apple sauce .
though nowadays tradition has made way for chinese chop suey , mexican burritos and other non-german specialties . christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
escape the modern day hectic now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuchen is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwein available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening proclamation at nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt - in existence since 1628 though christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago .
" the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said . after all , christmas markets are n't really about glühwein , reibekuchen or buying useless things - they 're about coming together in anticipation of the advent of christmas , a season of peace and harmony . andrea rönsberg -lrb- ncy , jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's gingerbread giant at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .

for him , it typifies the gradual decline of the black forest , one of germany 's biggest tourist draws . " that 's the most visible effect of pollution .
the trees began yellowing in autumn and have progressively lost their needles , " says the researcher from the german fva forestry office , which supervises the black forest . black forest badly damaged the agriculture ministry too acknowledges the problem has become acute .
in a report this month , it said that germany 's woodlands have never been in such bad shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in four trees is damaged , and the number of those worst hit has increased by eight percent over the last year , the report said .
the development is particularly disturbing in the black forest , which is considered to be 40 percent " damaged " , the worst attrition rate since 1983 . the number of unhealthy trees in this southwest corner of germany near the french border has risen by 10 percent over 2003 , due in part to a drought last year whose effects are being felt with some delay . pollution the culprit " you ca n't just turn a blind eye .
the black forest has been historically weakened , above all here on the western edges where the wind brings in pollutants from the rhine valley , " says wilpert . with a turn of the breeze , the soil can be contaminated with nitrates , ammonium , nitrogen and acids from industry and traffic in the valley . pollution 's first victims are the spruce and beech , shallow rooted trees which absorb elements closer to the surface of the soil .
the problem is even more pronounced on the other side of germany , where waste from heavy industry in poland and the czech republic wafts over woodland . self-made problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the fva is singling out the rhine river basin here , it does admit some responsibility for the problems by having planted trees from 1950-1970 that were not well adapted to the environment . " the spruce grows quickly .
we made the error of wanting to rapidly grow wood for cutting , " the researcher says , gesturing to a clutch of trees some 10 meters -lrb- 30 feet -rrb- taller than nearby pines planted at the same time . " but it 's a fragile tree and its needles are acidic and add to the pollution in the streams and ground water .

that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2004 gap growing between poor and rich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer a problem confined to the developing world a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it . the gap between the rich and poor in germany has drastically increased since 1998 when the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens took over from its conservative predecessors .
that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .
some 1.6 million germans own at least half a million euros each , and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : poverty in germany set to rise social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.12.2004 gap growing between poor and rich großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer a problem confined to the developing world a government-commissioned report on the rich-poor divide has found that poverty is on the rise in germany and that the state might in fact be exacerbating it . the gap between the rich and poor in germany has drastically increased since 1998 when the ruling coalition government of social democrats and greens took over from its conservative predecessors .
that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .
some 1.6 million germans own at least half a million euros each , and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : poverty in germany set to rise social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .

many a reveller gets into the spirit at one of the country 's omnipresent christmas markets . christmas time in germany means decorated trees , gifts , strings of colored lights and supermarket loudspeakers blaring carols .
that might not seem very different from christmas time in the rest of western hemisphere .
but , it 's the christmas markets that stand out in germany . mulled wine , music , and cold feet : you could say , that 's what 's special about christmas markets in germany .
a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .
the cathedral ’ s towers , reaching some 150 meters into the clear winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around two million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" they are n't the top -lrb- cologne tourist -rrb- attraction , " merfeld explained .
" for that we have the 2006 soccer world cup , next year 's world youth day and , of course , cologne 's carnival .
but the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights . " centuries ' old tradition wooden signs above the stalls state what 's on offer - anything from silver jewelry and wooden toys to christmas stollen , a cake typical of the season .
and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .
little old ladies use walking sticks to make their way through the crowd ; young mothers navigate prams with a grim determination through the narrow aisles ; and families huddle together with a warm drink - glühwein for the parents - for a brief respite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mulled wine , glühwein , is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwein .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff . besides the obligatory sausage , christmas market visitors can gorge on reibekuchen , potato pancakes served with apple sauce .
though nowadays tradition has made way for chinese chop suey , mexican burritos and other non-german specialties . christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
escape the modern day hectic now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuchen is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwein available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening proclamation at nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt - in existence since 1628 though christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago .
" the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said . after all , christmas markets are n't really about glühwein , reibekuchen or buying useless things - they 're about coming together in anticipation of the advent of christmas , a season of peace and harmony . andrea rönsberg -lrb- ncy , jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's gingerbread giant at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .

many a reveller gets into the spirit at one of the country 's omnipresent christmas markets . christmas time in germany means decorated trees , gifts , strings of colored lights and supermarket loudspeakers blaring carols .
that might not seem very different from christmas time in the rest of western hemisphere .
but , it 's the christmas markets that stand out in germany . mulled wine , music , and cold feet : you could say , that 's what 's special about christmas markets in germany .
a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .

" centuries ' old tradition wooden signs above the stalls state what 's on offer - anything from silver jewelry and wooden toys to christmas stollen , a cake typical of the season .
and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .

that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .
however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked . " " government making people poorer " faced with an ageing population and an overburdened welfare system as a result , the coalition government of social democrats and greens has set out to overhaul mechanisms of granting benefits for the needy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : of the measures to come into effect as of january next year will be the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits at a low level which will see a good proportion of people , first and foremost the long-term unemployed , in an even greater financial plight . barbara stolterfoht , head of the country ’ s welfare umbrella organization , predicts poverty levels going up even further as a result . " the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .
" but , merging this on the level of social benefits which is very low and which means poverty is a bad idea . "
stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .
" what this government is doing is just making people poorer without giving them work . " it 's a view shared by walter hanesch , a professor of social sciences in darmstadt .
he reckons that with an ongoing polarization in society more unrest is programmed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : essence this means that we ’ re drifting more and more towards a greater potential of social unrest in the country , he said .
" it ’ ll be interesting to see what impact the government ’ s social reforms will have in 2005 . " hanesch contended that the merging of unemployment and welfare benefits will not be conducive to reducing poverty levels .
" on the contrary , some of the poorest – particularly the long-term unemployed – will even get poorer . ” rich getting richer ? while more and more people have to turn over every cent , there ’ s also an increasing number of people at the other side of the spectrum who can afford to spend money like water . 10 percent of people with the highest earnings now account for almost half of all net incomes in the country .
some 1.6 million germans own at least half a million euros each , and an unspecified number can proudly call themselves billionaires . hardy graupner -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts : poverty in germany set to rise social organizations are warning of a dramatic increase in the number of poor people in germany as a result of welfare reforms being implemented next year .
children will be among the worst affected by the changes .

father thomas george pattarumadathil will be telling them about christmas in india and giving them insight into his experiences as an assistant parish priest in germany .

though the process may not be easy , there are still people like pattarumadathil who come to preach in germany , and fill gaps left by the dwindling number of germans entering the priesthood .
" there are many places , especially in rural areas , that would not be able to hold sunday services without foreign priests , " said reinhard kürzinger , a cathedral vicar in bavaria 's eichstätt diocese , who has directed a program that has been training foreign priests to work in germany since 1997 .

in most cases , foreign priests do not work independently but as part of a pastoral team and stay in germany for between five and seven years .
language often a problem making sure parishioners can understand the foreign priests is one of the main tasks for the churches .

in addition to language lessons , the priests also get tips on how to approach german parishioners and what church members expect of priests .

that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state .

" the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .

stolterfoht said poverty was bound to be the final outcome .

that 's the core finding of a draft study commissioned by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government and released on thursday . the draft report minces no words .
poverty is on the rise in what is still considered to be one of the richest countries in the world , it says . children worst affected the situation is particularly drastic in germany ’ s big cities where children are among those worst affected in families with either lower incomes and reduced subsidies or suffering from long-term unemployment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 5 percent of the households concerned have to make do with less than 60 percent of average earnings , which is generally accepted by social scientists in the western world as the definition of poverty . this means that these households have fewer than € 938 -lrb- $ 1,269 -rrb- a month at their disposal .
15 percent of children up to 14 years of age are registered as being poor , and 19 percent of young people between 14 and 19 years of age . german social scientist klaus hurrelmann maintains that families and particularly single-parent households are not adequately supported by the state . " the social situation of many children is getting worse , " he said .
" of course the problems that children in rich germany face can not be compared to those of children in the developing world .

" the merging of social and unemployment benefits is a good idea , not a bad one , " she said .

many a reveller gets into the spirit at one of the country 's omnipresent christmas markets . christmas time in germany means decorated trees , gifts , strings of colored lights and supermarket loudspeakers blaring carols .
that might not seem very different from christmas time in the rest of western hemisphere .
but , it 's the christmas markets that stand out in germany . mulled wine , music , and cold feet : you could say , that 's what 's special about christmas markets in germany .
a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .
the cathedral ’ s towers , reaching some 150 meters into the clear winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around two million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" they are n't the top -lrb- cologne tourist -rrb- attraction , " merfeld explained .
" for that we have the 2006 soccer world cup , next year 's world youth day and , of course , cologne 's carnival .
but the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights . " centuries ' old tradition wooden signs above the stalls state what 's on offer - anything from silver jewelry and wooden toys to christmas stollen , a cake typical of the season .
and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .
little old ladies use walking sticks to make their way through the crowd ; young mothers navigate prams with a grim determination through the narrow aisles ; and families huddle together with a warm drink - glühwein for the parents - for a brief respite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mulled wine , glühwein , is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwein .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff . besides the obligatory sausage , christmas market visitors can gorge on reibekuchen , potato pancakes served with apple sauce .
though nowadays tradition has made way for chinese chop suey , mexican burritos and other non-german specialties . christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
escape the modern day hectic now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuchen is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwein available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening proclamation at nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt - in existence since 1628 though christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago .
" the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said . after all , christmas markets are n't really about glühwein , reibekuchen or buying useless things - they 're about coming together in anticipation of the advent of christmas , a season of peace and harmony . andrea rönsberg -lrb- ncy , jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's gingerbread giant at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .

many a reveller gets into the spirit at one of the country 's omnipresent christmas markets . christmas time in germany means decorated trees , gifts , strings of colored lights and supermarket loudspeakers blaring carols .
that might not seem very different from christmas time in the rest of western hemisphere .
but , it 's the christmas markets that stand out in germany . mulled wine , music , and cold feet : you could say , that 's what 's special about christmas markets in germany .
a typical christmas market consists of small wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy food , and sometimes to buy christmas decorations , to stop and drink glühwein , german mulled wine .
there 's usually also a nativity scene on display , but with all the other distractions , it 's easily overlooked . cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's cathedral .
the cathedral ’ s towers , reaching some 150 meters into the clear winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around two million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" they are n't the top -lrb- cologne tourist -rrb- attraction , " merfeld explained .
" for that we have the 2006 soccer world cup , next year 's world youth day and , of course , cologne 's carnival .
but the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights . " centuries ' old tradition wooden signs above the stalls state what 's on offer - anything from silver jewelry and wooden toys to christmas stollen , a cake typical of the season .
and it 's a good thing that there are signs above the stalls - with the hordes of people making their way past each other , it 's hard to see what 's on display .
little old ladies use walking sticks to make their way through the crowd ; young mothers navigate prams with a grim determination through the narrow aisles ; and families huddle together with a warm drink - glühwein for the parents - for a brief respite . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mulled wine , glühwein , is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwein .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff . besides the obligatory sausage , christmas market visitors can gorge on reibekuchen , potato pancakes served with apple sauce .
though nowadays tradition has made way for chinese chop suey , mexican burritos and other non-german specialties . christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
escape the modern day hectic now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuchen is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwein available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening proclamation at nuremberg 's christkindlesmarkt - in existence since 1628 though christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago .
" the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said . after all , christmas markets are n't really about glühwein , reibekuchen or buying useless things - they 're about coming together in anticipation of the advent of christmas , a season of peace and harmony . andrea rönsberg -lrb- ncy , jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's gingerbread giant at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .

father thomas george pattarumadathil will be telling them about christmas in india and giving them insight into his experiences as an assistant parish priest in germany .
pattarumadathil , 37 , is one of many foreign pastors working in germany .
while there are no figures for the exact number of foreign religious workers in germany , most of whom come from eastern europe , india and africa , the catholic and protestant churches agree their help is appreciated .
filling a gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian priests are used to different conditions when preaching at home " foreign priests are welcome to help with pastoral care , " said stefanie uphues , a spokeswoman for the german bishops conference .
" it 's not easy for them , especially when the church and community structure differ from their experience at home . "
though the process may not be easy , there are still people like pattarumadathil who come to preach in germany , and fill gaps left by the dwindling number of germans entering the priesthood .
" there are many places , especially in rural areas , that would not be able to hold sunday services without foreign priests , " said reinhard kürzinger , a cathedral vicar in bavaria 's eichstätt diocese , who has directed a program that has been training foreign priests to work in germany since 1997 .
" many of the priests come from countries where germany used to do missionary work . "
missionizing in the home country but now germany itself has practically become a country in need of missionary work .
the german catholic church , which has about 26 million members , ordained 130 priests in 2003 , one less than 2002 , continuing a general downward trend .
the number of priests here has been on the decline for the past 15 years , with the amount of active catholic priests falling 20 percent since 1990 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign pastors are at work in catholic as well as protestant churches in germany foreign pastors are also at work in germany 's protestant church , which also counts about 26 million members .
but unlike the catholic church , there is no program to encourage them to work in german congregations , according to christof vetter , a german protestant church spokesman .
foreigners part of pastoral team recognizing the increasing need for foreign religious workers , kürzinger recently drew up guidelines to help dioceses looking to use foreign priests .
he outlined what the church needs to do to ensure that the foreigners fit into their congregation and what assistance their german mentors should provide .
in most cases , foreign priests do not work independently but as part of a pastoral team and stay in germany for between five and seven years .
language often a problem making sure parishioners can understand the foreign priests is one of the main tasks for the churches .
but , being able to speak german is sometimes not enough .
the dialects spoken in parts of the country can seem indecipherable even to priests who speak german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with a declining number of germans going into the priesthood , the country 's dioceses are looking abroad for help " my german is good , and i can speak without thinking about each word , but i can still make improvements to my grammar , " said pattarumadathil , who has been in germany for three years and receives language courses from the eichstätt diocese .
" people here are patient with me and have made me feel really comfortable . "
in addition to language lessons , the priests also get tips on how to approach german parishioners and what church members expect of priests .
" the essence of the liturgy here is the same , but the cultural and traditional differences make it very different from india , " pattarumadathil said .
" but people have been patient , and i feel like i 'm at home here .

for him , it typifies the gradual decline of the black forest , one of germany 's biggest tourist draws . " that 's the most visible effect of pollution .
the trees began yellowing in autumn and have progressively lost their needles , " says the researcher from the german fva forestry office , which supervises the black forest . black forest badly damaged the agriculture ministry too acknowledges the problem has become acute .
in a report this month , it said that germany 's woodlands have never been in such bad shape . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one in four trees is damaged , and the number of those worst hit has increased by eight percent over the last year , the report said .
the development is particularly disturbing in the black forest , which is considered to be 40 percent " damaged " , the worst attrition rate since 1983 . the number of unhealthy trees in this southwest corner of germany near the french border has risen by 10 percent over 2003 , due in part to a drought last year whose effects are being felt with some delay . pollution the culprit " you ca n't just turn a blind eye .
the black forest has been historically weakened , above all here on the western edges where the wind brings in pollutants from the rhine valley , " says wilpert . with a turn of the breeze , the soil can be contaminated with nitrates , ammonium , nitrogen and acids from industry and traffic in the valley . pollution 's first victims are the spruce and beech , shallow rooted trees which absorb elements closer to the surface of the soil .
the problem is even more pronounced on the other side of germany , where waste from heavy industry in poland and the czech republic wafts over woodland . self-made problem ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while the fva is singling out the rhine river basin here , it does admit some responsibility for the problems by having planted trees from 1950-1970 that were not well adapted to the environment . " the spruce grows quickly .
we made the error of wanting to rapidly grow wood for cutting , " the researcher says , gesturing to a clutch of trees some 10 meters -lrb- 30 feet -rrb- taller than nearby pines planted at the same time . " but it 's a fragile tree and its needles are acidic and add to the pollution in the streams and ground water . " researchers and experts may be assessing the destruction and outlining ways to nurse the ailing woodlands back to health .

tim blackman 's 21-year-old daughter lucie was drugged , raped and murdered .
her father , 51 , of the isle of wight , said the scheme let people send a delayed message if they felt unsafe .
the text message is stored for up to 24 hours , which the user cancels if they arrive safely .
if they do not arrive , the message is sent to raise the alarm .
lucie blackman was working as a nightclub hostess in the roppongi district of tokyo when she vanished in july 2000 .
trial under way the former flight attendant , from sevenoaks , had told a room-mate she was going to the seaside , but did not say who with .
it was the last time anyone heard from her .
her dismembered body was found in february 2001 after a seven-month search .
japanese property developer joji obara , 52 , went on trial last year accused of abduction , rape and disposal of the body , as well as attacks on other women - he denies all charges .
lucie 's father said : " here is a device that people should use as a way to make sure that if something happened to them , somebody would know where to start looking .
" do n't think ' oh well , it wo n't happen to me ' , because it can happen to you . "
he said the text scheme would have allowed his daughter to be found in seven hours rather than seven months .

hundreds of drivers were forced to sleep in their vehicles after the three lorry pile-up on the a74 between carlisle and gretna on wednesday .
timothy parker , 42 , and his son bryan , 12 , from eccles in salford , greater manchester were killed .
the route linking england and scotland was reopened on thursday night after a clean-up operation .
red powder it is believed that mr parker and his son were heading south when high winds blew their lorry on to the northbound carriageway , where it overturned and was hit by two other lorries two police officers needed hospital treatment after coming into contact with a mystery red powder , which leaked from one of the crashed lorries .
i know the government consider railways to be a higher priority , but cumbria can not survive without decent roads mp david maclean britain 's worst roads cumbria 's chief constable michael baxter said the substance had been " the main problem " .
mr baxter said : " we could n't reopen the highway with this there .
" another problem is that we simply do not know what a lot of these lorries are carrying on our county 's roads .
" barriers are something we need to look at .
we will be having a thorough debrief with all the agencies involved , to see if our contingency plans worked well . "
he said he would be looking at ways to remove central reservation barriers to enable traffic to leave accident scenes more quickly .
mr baxter also agreed with some motorists who claimed there were too few road signs informing drivers how to find alternative routes .
penrith and the border tory mp david maclean , whose constituency includes the stretch of the a74 where the accident happened , criticised the government over its roads policy .
he called on ministers to improve cumbria 's road network , especially the a74 and a66 .
mr maclean said : " i 'm fed up nagging about the cumberland gap , the a66 and other roads in my constituency .
stranded in cars " i know the government consider railways to be a higher priority , but cumbria can not survive without decent roads . "
people were left stranded in their cars as police officers walked up and down the miles of vehicles with soup and cups of tea .
additional officers were drafted in from northumbria police to help divert motorists .
cumbria police earlier said the recovery operation was restricted because the a74 only has two lanes and no hard shoulder , so gaining access was difficult .
police say it not thought to be dangerous to motorists as long as they remain in vehicles .
were you trapped in your vehicle following the crash ?
have your travel plans been affected ?
send us your comments .
this debate has now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your comments : it is times like this i remind myself why i left britain with it 's traffic nightmares !
rob wilson , new zealand £ 400m-plus spent on the scottish parliament and yet we still have a bumpy , poor standard highway linking two of the major countries in the uk .
for crying out loud , how difficult is it to build a stretch of motorway in an area as flat as a pancake ?
tarun patel , gloucestershire the police said it was " not thought to be dangerous to motorists as long as they remain in vehicles " .
has the person who said this ever been stuck in a car in freezing temperatures for six or seven hours with a small baby or elderly person ?
what a complete idiot .
the handling of this incident is a disgrace .
andrew , warwick , england i 've heard people asking if an accident would be allowed to leave the m1 or the m25 blocked for more than 24 hours .
yes it would .
i got stuck in a big motorway jam in 2003 on the m25 , got diverted off to south mimms services .
both sides of the m25 where closed , one side got reopened , the other remained closed for more than 24hours .
sarah , chelmsford , essex can someone please give us a transport secretary that is n't anti-car , actually has a drivers licence , drives daily and knows what the hell they are actually talking about ?

hundreds of drivers were forced to sleep in their vehicles after the three lorry pile-up on the a74 between carlisle and gretna on wednesday .
timothy parker , 42 , and his son bryan , 12 , from eccles in salford , greater manchester were killed .
the route linking england and scotland was reopened on thursday night after a clean-up operation .
red powder it is believed that mr parker and his son were heading south when high winds blew their lorry on to the northbound carriageway , where it overturned and was hit by two other lorries two police officers needed hospital treatment after coming into contact with a mystery red powder , which leaked from one of the crashed lorries .
i know the government consider railways to be a higher priority , but cumbria can not survive without decent roads mp david maclean britain 's worst roads cumbria 's chief constable michael baxter said the substance had been " the main problem " .
mr baxter said : " we could n't reopen the highway with this there .
" another problem is that we simply do not know what a lot of these lorries are carrying on our county 's roads .
" barriers are something we need to look at .
we will be having a thorough debrief with all the agencies involved , to see if our contingency plans worked well . "
he said he would be looking at ways to remove central reservation barriers to enable traffic to leave accident scenes more quickly .
mr baxter also agreed with some motorists who claimed there were too few road signs informing drivers how to find alternative routes .
penrith and the border tory mp david maclean , whose constituency includes the stretch of the a74 where the accident happened , criticised the government over its roads policy .
he called on ministers to improve cumbria 's road network , especially the a74 and a66 .
mr maclean said : " i 'm fed up nagging about the cumberland gap , the a66 and other roads in my constituency .
stranded in cars " i know the government consider railways to be a higher priority , but cumbria can not survive without decent roads . "
people were left stranded in their cars as police officers walked up and down the miles of vehicles with soup and cups of tea .
additional officers were drafted in from northumbria police to help divert motorists .
cumbria police earlier said the recovery operation was restricted because the a74 only has two lanes and no hard shoulder , so gaining access was difficult .
police say it not thought to be dangerous to motorists as long as they remain in vehicles .
were you trapped in your vehicle following the crash ?
have your travel plans been affected ?
send us your comments .
this debate has now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your comments : it is times like this i remind myself why i left britain with it 's traffic nightmares !
rob wilson , new zealand £ 400m-plus spent on the scottish parliament and yet we still have a bumpy , poor standard highway linking two of the major countries in the uk .
for crying out loud , how difficult is it to build a stretch of motorway in an area as flat as a pancake ?
tarun patel , gloucestershire the police said it was " not thought to be dangerous to motorists as long as they remain in vehicles " .
has the person who said this ever been stuck in a car in freezing temperatures for six or seven hours with a small baby or elderly person ?
what a complete idiot .
the handling of this incident is a disgrace .
andrew , warwick , england i 've heard people asking if an accident would be allowed to leave the m1 or the m25 blocked for more than 24 hours .
yes it would .
i got stuck in a big motorway jam in 2003 on the m25 , got diverted off to south mimms services .
both sides of the m25 where closed , one side got reopened , the other remained closed for more than 24hours .
sarah , chelmsford , essex can someone please give us a transport secretary that is n't anti-car , actually has a drivers licence , drives daily and knows what the hell they are actually talking about ?
