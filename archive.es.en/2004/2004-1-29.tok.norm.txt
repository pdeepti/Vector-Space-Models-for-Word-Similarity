metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers at a daimlerchrysler plant in mannheim .
the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .

"
after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .
the seminar , to be held with representatives from the world jewish congress , was intended to focus on accusations of growing bias against jews in the european union .
prodi called off the meeting after he was specifically named in the press as being responsible for a controversial study in november last year naming israel as europe ’ s greatest threat to peace .
since then prodi and the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , have made amends .
preparations are now underway for the seminar to take place .
but the fuss surrounding the seminar is indicative of the attention such accusations of anti-semitism garner in europe .
just over a week ago , anti-semitism was once again in the headlines after the israeli ambassador to sweden vandalized a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white .
calling it an " act against growing anti-semitism , " israeli premier ariel sharon endorsed the ambassador ’ s action .
dw-world readers responded to the news with a variety of comments .
read what they had to say : " the saddest thing in all this is that every time someone tries to understand what leads a human being to such desperate actions , some jewish fanatics step up and denounce it as an endorsement for the act and call the understander purely anti-semitic , which is quite laughable since the artist is a jew .
these same fanatics call critics of the state of israel anti-semites and those who try to make true peace with their neighbors are called traitors .
so in response to the ambassador ’ s accusations of anti-semitism , i call him an anti-understander of suffering and desperation and a traitor for denouncing a fellow jew ’ s curiosity of such desperation and suffering . " - mike messiah , montreal , canada " attacking that piece of work in sweden was an incredibly dumb thing to do .
understandably , such a ‘ neutral ’ depiction of violence can cause pain to any victims of terrorism .
yet for the ambassador to vandalize another country ’ s art is an act of base juvenilishness and should be punished by sharon , not praised . " - eric h. west " i find it tedious that any pejorative action , comment or reference toward the israelis or jewish people is being considered by sharon to be anti-semitic .
it seems sometimes that the jewish people -lrb- not as a whole , but when it comes to public reactions -rrb- have become used to a victim status and have trouble getting out of that mindset ; everything is a personal attack , because of their religion .
i support the efforts against anti-semitism that still threatens jews all over the world , but i would hail the recognition that not every negative comment against a jewish person is an anti-semitic remark . " - andrew aitken , canadian in berlin " it is difficult to agree with the actions of the ambassador .
whatever his motivations and his sentiments , it is an extreme act to destroy a work of art in a museum .
on the other hand , the suicide bombings in israel have left so many dead , wounded and scarred that it is no ordinary subject for an artist to select .
he knew he was being provocative when he selected his theme and certainly when he treated the subject as he did .
so the artist sets out to provoke a reaction and he provokes a reaction – would the artist call the ambassador ’ s response ‘ performance art ’ ?
the two of them ought to be ashamed . " - glenn easton " i do not believe the israeli ambassador was right in destroying the art work .
the world needs to know that being pro-palestinian , pro peace or even anti-israel is not synonymous with anti-semitism .
one can hate a government without hating it ’ s people . " - katherine juestel , american in australia " both the ambassador and ariel sharon have behaved abominably in this case .
i am not anti-semitic , but am very quickly losing patience with the actions of the israeli government . " - harry calkins , illinois , u.s.
" i think the artist ’ s exhibit in stockholm was anti-semitic and praised terrorist murderers of innocent civilians .
i think that israeli ambassador mazal most definitely did the right thing . " - name withheld " the artist himself being jewish quite appropriately depicts the wrongs on both sides , and ever since sharon took office it seems that even the truth is perceived to represent anti-semitism .
the truth is that horrible suffering is experienced by both sides , but sharon ’ s actions have only fed the flames of hatred of a people who have no options left . " - inge perreault " the israeli ambassador behaved very unprofessionally and he did not improve the image of israeli politicians and diplomats in europe .
i fear such behavior will lead to more israel critical voices in europe . " - atilla a. iftikhar " a pool of ‘ blood ’ with snow white is not a work of art .
i agree with the destruction .
too bad it was not permanent . " - e.p. coughlin " the artist must be given an opportunity to explain the intent and motivation for the creation of the work .
after this the rest of the world can debate the intent and whether one would support the display in their own neighborhood .
the destruction or defacing of art must be held as a criminal act with severe penalties . " - thomas clark " i see the act of the israeli ambassador as a strong political act .
i do not believe it is an attack against art itself , and the fact that he understood or not he meaning and intent of the artwork is meaningless .
i believe he used this piece as a simple opportunity to push his political views and make a slam .
i find it sad that the israeli political establishment is so violently attacking the rest of the planet , i.e. the vast majority of people -lrb- including most europeans -rrb- who observe that their politics are utterly blind and drive the middle east into a deep end .
i believe history will record sharon and his supporters as some of the worst politicians in israel .
instead of acting for the population ’ s good , they instead may be creating the conditions for the demise of israel .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers at a daimlerchrysler plant in mannheim .
the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

"
after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers at a daimlerchrysler plant in mannheim .
the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

the eu has been a keen supporter of the protocol which is being held up by the refusal of the us and russia to ratify it .
to enter into force , the 1997 deal needs countries responsible for at least 55 percent of greenhouse gas emissions to sign up .
as washington has said it will not ratify the deal , russia holds the key to its success , or failure .

after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .
the seminar , to be held with representatives from the world jewish congress , was intended to focus on accusations of growing bias against jews in the european union .
prodi called off the meeting after he was specifically named in the press as being responsible for a controversial study in november last year naming israel as europe ’ s greatest threat to peace .
since then prodi and the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , have made amends .
preparations are now underway for the seminar to take place .
but the fuss surrounding the seminar is indicative of the attention such accusations of anti-semitism garner in europe .
just over a week ago , anti-semitism was once again in the headlines after the israeli ambassador to sweden vandalized a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white .
calling it an " act against growing anti-semitism , " israeli premier ariel sharon endorsed the ambassador ’ s action .
dw-world readers responded to the news with a variety of comments .
read what they had to say : " the saddest thing in all this is that every time someone tries to understand what leads a human being to such desperate actions , some jewish fanatics step up and denounce it as an endorsement for the act and call the understander purely anti-semitic , which is quite laughable since the artist is a jew .
these same fanatics call critics of the state of israel anti-semites and those who try to make true peace with their neighbors are called traitors .
so in response to the ambassador ’ s accusations of anti-semitism , i call him an anti-understander of suffering and desperation and a traitor for denouncing a fellow jew ’ s curiosity of such desperation and suffering . " - mike messiah , montreal , canada " attacking that piece of work in sweden was an incredibly dumb thing to do .
understandably , such a ‘ neutral ’ depiction of violence can cause pain to any victims of terrorism .

" - eric h. west " i find it tedious that any pejorative action , comment or reference toward the israelis or jewish people is being considered by sharon to be anti-semitic .
it seems sometimes that the jewish people -lrb- not as a whole , but when it comes to public reactions -rrb- have become used to a victim status and have trouble getting out of that mindset ; everything is a personal attack , because of their religion .
i support the efforts against anti-semitism that still threatens jews all over the world , but i would hail the recognition that not every negative comment against a jewish person is an anti-semitic remark . " - andrew aitken , canadian in berlin " it is difficult to agree with the actions of the ambassador .
whatever his motivations and his sentiments , it is an extreme act to destroy a work of art in a museum .
on the other hand , the suicide bombings in israel have left so many dead , wounded and scarred that it is no ordinary subject for an artist to select .
he knew he was being provocative when he selected his theme and certainly when he treated the subject as he did .

the two of them ought to be ashamed . " - glenn easton " i do not believe the israeli ambassador was right in destroying the art work .
the world needs to know that being pro-palestinian , pro peace or even anti-israel is not synonymous with anti-semitism .

after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .
the seminar , to be held with representatives from the world jewish congress , was intended to focus on accusations of growing bias against jews in the european union .
prodi called off the meeting after he was specifically named in the press as being responsible for a controversial study in november last year naming israel as europe ’ s greatest threat to peace .
since then prodi and the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , have made amends .
preparations are now underway for the seminar to take place .
but the fuss surrounding the seminar is indicative of the attention such accusations of anti-semitism garner in europe .
just over a week ago , anti-semitism was once again in the headlines after the israeli ambassador to sweden vandalized a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white .
calling it an " act against growing anti-semitism , " israeli premier ariel sharon endorsed the ambassador ’ s action .
dw-world readers responded to the news with a variety of comments .
read what they had to say : " the saddest thing in all this is that every time someone tries to understand what leads a human being to such desperate actions , some jewish fanatics step up and denounce it as an endorsement for the act and call the understander purely anti-semitic , which is quite laughable since the artist is a jew .
these same fanatics call critics of the state of israel anti-semites and those who try to make true peace with their neighbors are called traitors .

" - mike messiah , montreal , canada " attacking that piece of work in sweden was an incredibly dumb thing to do .
understandably , such a ‘ neutral ’ depiction of violence can cause pain to any victims of terrorism .

" - eric h. west " i find it tedious that any pejorative action , comment or reference toward the israelis or jewish people is being considered by sharon to be anti-semitic .
it seems sometimes that the jewish people -lrb- not as a whole , but when it comes to public reactions -rrb- have become used to a victim status and have trouble getting out of that mindset ; everything is a personal attack , because of their religion .
i support the efforts against anti-semitism that still threatens jews all over the world , but i would hail the recognition that not every negative comment against a jewish person is an anti-semitic remark . " - andrew aitken , canadian in berlin " it is difficult to agree with the actions of the ambassador .

after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .
the seminar , to be held with representatives from the world jewish congress , was intended to focus on accusations of growing bias against jews in the european union .
prodi called off the meeting after he was specifically named in the press as being responsible for a controversial study in november last year naming israel as europe ’ s greatest threat to peace .
since then prodi and the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , have made amends .
preparations are now underway for the seminar to take place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.01.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc briton gets top job at eu arms agency the eu 's foreign policy chief javier solana announced the appointment of nick witney as head of the unit - a key element of the eu 's common foreign and security policy .
the choice was up to solana after paris and london could not find a compromise solution .
but france 's annoyance at the news is likely to be mitigated by the appointment of a french officer to take over as head of the eu 's military staff from february .
there is also talk of witney stepping down after three years in favour of his french counterpart .
the armaments chief 's nationality is especially important in this case , because different eu countries are said to have different ideas about what the agency should achieve .
for the italians and germans , the agency should be a small-scale co-ordination unit .
but the french want the agency to define a european arms procurement strategy .
the uk 's position is somewhere in the middle .
it believes that the agency should help national defense ministries develop and harmonize armaments across the eu but that the french idea goes too far .

instead the club ’ s lawyer markus schäpe suggested more mandatory rest breaks for drivers .

the state prosecutor has accused a former border commander and his two assistants , today 69 and 70 years old , of being responsible for the death of four escapees .
the three border guards have pleaded " not guilty . "
speaking to the court , the former commander said he regretted " all the deaths and injuries resulting from the politics of the cold war . "
at the same time , he defended himself against the " despicable and discriminating accusations " that east german authorities simply accepted the deaths as a matter of course .
all three of the accused referred to the former east german law , under which their actions would not have been considered illegal .
according to the state prosecutor ’ s office , there are currently three similar cases still pending ruling .
in berlin alone , more than 100 people were killed trying to escape over the wall . more briefs 28.01.2004 -pipe- study uncovers discrepancies in german primary schooling 28.01.2004 -pipe- fewer conscripts to serve in german army 28.01.2004 -pipe- germany plans to return afghan refugees home 27.01.2004 -pipe- former professor accused of nazi-era “ mercy killings ” 27.01.2004 -pipe- germany and canada sign women ’ s soccer deal 27.01.2004 -pipe- bayern 's deisler leaves nerve clinic 27.01.2004 -pipe- german to be extradited from kazakhstan 27.01.2004 -pipe- schröder 's party fined for illegal donation radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "

the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "

the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.01.2004 -pipe- 17:00 utc east german officers face charges of murder nearly 15 years after the berlin wall fell , one of the last chapters in east german history unfolded thursday in a berlin court when three former border guards were called upon to answer to charges of murder and accessory to murder .
the state prosecutor has accused a former border commander and his two assistants , today 69 and 70 years old , of being responsible for the death of four escapees .
the three border guards have pleaded " not guilty . "
speaking to the court , the former commander said he regretted " all the deaths and injuries resulting from the politics of the cold war . "
at the same time , he defended himself against the " despicable and discriminating accusations " that east german authorities simply accepted the deaths as a matter of course .

"
after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .
the seminar , to be held with representatives from the world jewish congress , was intended to focus on accusations of growing bias against jews in the european union .
prodi called off the meeting after he was specifically named in the press as being responsible for a controversial study in november last year naming israel as europe ’ s greatest threat to peace .
since then prodi and the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , have made amends .
preparations are now underway for the seminar to take place .
but the fuss surrounding the seminar is indicative of the attention such accusations of anti-semitism garner in europe .
just over a week ago , anti-semitism was once again in the headlines after the israeli ambassador to sweden vandalized a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white .
calling it an " act against growing anti-semitism , " israeli premier ariel sharon endorsed the ambassador ’ s action .
dw-world readers responded to the news with a variety of comments .
read what they had to say : " the saddest thing in all this is that every time someone tries to understand what leads a human being to such desperate actions , some jewish fanatics step up and denounce it as an endorsement for the act and call the understander purely anti-semitic , which is quite laughable since the artist is a jew .
these same fanatics call critics of the state of israel anti-semites and those who try to make true peace with their neighbors are called traitors .
so in response to the ambassador ’ s accusations of anti-semitism , i call him an anti-understander of suffering and desperation and a traitor for denouncing a fellow jew ’ s curiosity of such desperation and suffering . " - mike messiah , montreal , canada " attacking that piece of work in sweden was an incredibly dumb thing to do .
understandably , such a ‘ neutral ’ depiction of violence can cause pain to any victims of terrorism .
yet for the ambassador to vandalize another country ’ s art is an act of base juvenilishness and should be punished by sharon , not praised . " - eric h. west " i find it tedious that any pejorative action , comment or reference toward the israelis or jewish people is being considered by sharon to be anti-semitic .
it seems sometimes that the jewish people -lrb- not as a whole , but when it comes to public reactions -rrb- have become used to a victim status and have trouble getting out of that mindset ; everything is a personal attack , because of their religion .
i support the efforts against anti-semitism that still threatens jews all over the world , but i would hail the recognition that not every negative comment against a jewish person is an anti-semitic remark . " - andrew aitken , canadian in berlin " it is difficult to agree with the actions of the ambassador .
whatever his motivations and his sentiments , it is an extreme act to destroy a work of art in a museum .
on the other hand , the suicide bombings in israel have left so many dead , wounded and scarred that it is no ordinary subject for an artist to select .
he knew he was being provocative when he selected his theme and certainly when he treated the subject as he did .
so the artist sets out to provoke a reaction and he provokes a reaction – would the artist call the ambassador ’ s response ‘ performance art ’ ?
the two of them ought to be ashamed . " - glenn easton " i do not believe the israeli ambassador was right in destroying the art work .
the world needs to know that being pro-palestinian , pro peace or even anti-israel is not synonymous with anti-semitism .
one can hate a government without hating it ’ s people . " - katherine juestel , american in australia " both the ambassador and ariel sharon have behaved abominably in this case .
i am not anti-semitic , but am very quickly losing patience with the actions of the israeli government . " - harry calkins , illinois , u.s.

the truth is that horrible suffering is experienced by both sides , but sharon ’ s actions have only fed the flames of hatred of a people who have no options left . " - inge perreault " the israeli ambassador behaved very unprofessionally and he did not improve the image of israeli politicians and diplomats in europe .

i agree with the destruction .
too bad it was not permanent . " - e.p. coughlin " the artist must be given an opportunity to explain the intent and motivation for the creation of the work .
after this the rest of the world can debate the intent and whether one would support the display in their own neighborhood .
the destruction or defacing of art must be held as a criminal act with severe penalties . " - thomas clark " i see the act of the israeli ambassador as a strong political act .
i do not believe it is an attack against art itself , and the fact that he understood or not he meaning and intent of the artwork is meaningless .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers at a daimlerchrysler plant in mannheim .
the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

"
after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .
the seminar , to be held with representatives from the world jewish congress , was intended to focus on accusations of growing bias against jews in the european union .
prodi called off the meeting after he was specifically named in the press as being responsible for a controversial study in november last year naming israel as europe ’ s greatest threat to peace .
since then prodi and the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , have made amends .
preparations are now underway for the seminar to take place .
but the fuss surrounding the seminar is indicative of the attention such accusations of anti-semitism garner in europe .
just over a week ago , anti-semitism was once again in the headlines after the israeli ambassador to sweden vandalized a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white .
calling it an " act against growing anti-semitism , " israeli premier ariel sharon endorsed the ambassador ’ s action .
dw-world readers responded to the news with a variety of comments .
read what they had to say : " the saddest thing in all this is that every time someone tries to understand what leads a human being to such desperate actions , some jewish fanatics step up and denounce it as an endorsement for the act and call the understander purely anti-semitic , which is quite laughable since the artist is a jew .
these same fanatics call critics of the state of israel anti-semites and those who try to make true peace with their neighbors are called traitors .
so in response to the ambassador ’ s accusations of anti-semitism , i call him an anti-understander of suffering and desperation and a traitor for denouncing a fellow jew ’ s curiosity of such desperation and suffering . " - mike messiah , montreal , canada " attacking that piece of work in sweden was an incredibly dumb thing to do .
understandably , such a ‘ neutral ’ depiction of violence can cause pain to any victims of terrorism .
yet for the ambassador to vandalize another country ’ s art is an act of base juvenilishness and should be punished by sharon , not praised . " - eric h. west " i find it tedious that any pejorative action , comment or reference toward the israelis or jewish people is being considered by sharon to be anti-semitic .
it seems sometimes that the jewish people -lrb- not as a whole , but when it comes to public reactions -rrb- have become used to a victim status and have trouble getting out of that mindset ; everything is a personal attack , because of their religion .
i support the efforts against anti-semitism that still threatens jews all over the world , but i would hail the recognition that not every negative comment against a jewish person is an anti-semitic remark . " - andrew aitken , canadian in berlin " it is difficult to agree with the actions of the ambassador .
whatever his motivations and his sentiments , it is an extreme act to destroy a work of art in a museum .
on the other hand , the suicide bombings in israel have left so many dead , wounded and scarred that it is no ordinary subject for an artist to select .
he knew he was being provocative when he selected his theme and certainly when he treated the subject as he did .
so the artist sets out to provoke a reaction and he provokes a reaction – would the artist call the ambassador ’ s response ‘ performance art ’ ?
the two of them ought to be ashamed . " - glenn easton " i do not believe the israeli ambassador was right in destroying the art work .

"
after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .
the seminar , to be held with representatives from the world jewish congress , was intended to focus on accusations of growing bias against jews in the european union .
prodi called off the meeting after he was specifically named in the press as being responsible for a controversial study in november last year naming israel as europe ’ s greatest threat to peace .
since then prodi and the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , have made amends .
preparations are now underway for the seminar to take place .
but the fuss surrounding the seminar is indicative of the attention such accusations of anti-semitism garner in europe .
just over a week ago , anti-semitism was once again in the headlines after the israeli ambassador to sweden vandalized a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white .
calling it an " act against growing anti-semitism , " israeli premier ariel sharon endorsed the ambassador ’ s action .
dw-world readers responded to the news with a variety of comments .
read what they had to say : " the saddest thing in all this is that every time someone tries to understand what leads a human being to such desperate actions , some jewish fanatics step up and denounce it as an endorsement for the act and call the understander purely anti-semitic , which is quite laughable since the artist is a jew .
these same fanatics call critics of the state of israel anti-semites and those who try to make true peace with their neighbors are called traitors .
so in response to the ambassador ’ s accusations of anti-semitism , i call him an anti-understander of suffering and desperation and a traitor for denouncing a fellow jew ’ s curiosity of such desperation and suffering . " - mike messiah , montreal , canada " attacking that piece of work in sweden was an incredibly dumb thing to do .
understandably , such a ‘ neutral ’ depiction of violence can cause pain to any victims of terrorism .
yet for the ambassador to vandalize another country ’ s art is an act of base juvenilishness and should be punished by sharon , not praised . " - eric h. west " i find it tedious that any pejorative action , comment or reference toward the israelis or jewish people is being considered by sharon to be anti-semitic .
it seems sometimes that the jewish people -lrb- not as a whole , but when it comes to public reactions -rrb- have become used to a victim status and have trouble getting out of that mindset ; everything is a personal attack , because of their religion .
i support the efforts against anti-semitism that still threatens jews all over the world , but i would hail the recognition that not every negative comment against a jewish person is an anti-semitic remark . " - andrew aitken , canadian in berlin " it is difficult to agree with the actions of the ambassador .
whatever his motivations and his sentiments , it is an extreme act to destroy a work of art in a museum .
on the other hand , the suicide bombings in israel have left so many dead , wounded and scarred that it is no ordinary subject for an artist to select .
he knew he was being provocative when he selected his theme and certainly when he treated the subject as he did .
so the artist sets out to provoke a reaction and he provokes a reaction – would the artist call the ambassador ’ s response ‘ performance art ’ ?
the two of them ought to be ashamed . " - glenn easton " i do not believe the israeli ambassador was right in destroying the art work .
the world needs to know that being pro-palestinian , pro peace or even anti-israel is not synonymous with anti-semitism .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers at a daimlerchrysler plant in mannheim .
the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "

the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .
the seminar , to be held with representatives from the world jewish congress , was intended to focus on accusations of growing bias against jews in the european union .
prodi called off the meeting after he was specifically named in the press as being responsible for a controversial study in november last year naming israel as europe ’ s greatest threat to peace .
since then prodi and the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , have made amends .

just over a week ago , anti-semitism was once again in the headlines after the israeli ambassador to sweden vandalized a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white .
calling it an " act against growing anti-semitism , " israeli premier ariel sharon endorsed the ambassador ’ s action .
dw-world readers responded to the news with a variety of comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.01.2004 german metalworkers launch warning strikes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall is making sure its demands are heard .
metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers at a daimlerchrysler plant in mannheim .
the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "

the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

"
after the eu commission cancelled a conference with jewish leaders and a swedish museum displayed works by a palestinian terrorist , many dw-world readers expressed concern that europe is becoming anti-semitic . at the beginning of january , eu commission president romano prodi came under attack for announcing he would cancel a high-profile seminar on anti-semitism scheduled to take place in february .
the seminar , to be held with representatives from the world jewish congress , was intended to focus on accusations of growing bias against jews in the european union .
prodi called off the meeting after he was specifically named in the press as being responsible for a controversial study in november last year naming israel as europe ’ s greatest threat to peace .
since then prodi and the chairman of the governing board of the world jewish congress , israel singer , have made amends .
preparations are now underway for the seminar to take place .
but the fuss surrounding the seminar is indicative of the attention such accusations of anti-semitism garner in europe .
just over a week ago , anti-semitism was once again in the headlines after the israeli ambassador to sweden vandalized a work of art depicting a palestinian suicide bomber as snow white .
calling it an " act against growing anti-semitism , " israeli premier ariel sharon endorsed the ambassador ’ s action .
dw-world readers responded to the news with a variety of comments .
read what they had to say : " the saddest thing in all this is that every time someone tries to understand what leads a human being to such desperate actions , some jewish fanatics step up and denounce it as an endorsement for the act and call the understander purely anti-semitic , which is quite laughable since the artist is a jew .
these same fanatics call critics of the state of israel anti-semites and those who try to make true peace with their neighbors are called traitors .
so in response to the ambassador ’ s accusations of anti-semitism , i call him an anti-understander of suffering and desperation and a traitor for denouncing a fellow jew ’ s curiosity of such desperation and suffering . " - mike messiah , montreal , canada " attacking that piece of work in sweden was an incredibly dumb thing to do .
understandably , such a ‘ neutral ’ depiction of violence can cause pain to any victims of terrorism .
yet for the ambassador to vandalize another country ’ s art is an act of base juvenilishness and should be punished by sharon , not praised . " - eric h. west " i find it tedious that any pejorative action , comment or reference toward the israelis or jewish people is being considered by sharon to be anti-semitic .
it seems sometimes that the jewish people -lrb- not as a whole , but when it comes to public reactions -rrb- have become used to a victim status and have trouble getting out of that mindset ; everything is a personal attack , because of their religion .
i support the efforts against anti-semitism that still threatens jews all over the world , but i would hail the recognition that not every negative comment against a jewish person is an anti-semitic remark . " - andrew aitken , canadian in berlin " it is difficult to agree with the actions of the ambassador .
whatever his motivations and his sentiments , it is an extreme act to destroy a work of art in a museum .
on the other hand , the suicide bombings in israel have left so many dead , wounded and scarred that it is no ordinary subject for an artist to select .
he knew he was being provocative when he selected his theme and certainly when he treated the subject as he did .
so the artist sets out to provoke a reaction and he provokes a reaction – would the artist call the ambassador ’ s response ‘ performance art ’ ?
the two of them ought to be ashamed . " - glenn easton " i do not believe the israeli ambassador was right in destroying the art work .
the world needs to know that being pro-palestinian , pro peace or even anti-israel is not synonymous with anti-semitism .
one can hate a government without hating it ’ s people . " - katherine juestel , american in australia " both the ambassador and ariel sharon have behaved abominably in this case .
i am not anti-semitic , but am very quickly losing patience with the actions of the israeli government . " - harry calkins , illinois , u.s.
" i think the artist ’ s exhibit in stockholm was anti-semitic and praised terrorist murderers of innocent civilians .
i think that israeli ambassador mazal most definitely did the right thing . " - name withheld " the artist himself being jewish quite appropriately depicts the wrongs on both sides , and ever since sharon took office it seems that even the truth is perceived to represent anti-semitism .
the truth is that horrible suffering is experienced by both sides , but sharon ’ s actions have only fed the flames of hatred of a people who have no options left . " - inge perreault " the israeli ambassador behaved very unprofessionally and he did not improve the image of israeli politicians and diplomats in europe .
i fear such behavior will lead to more israel critical voices in europe . " - atilla a. iftikhar " a pool of ‘ blood ’ with snow white is not a work of art .
i agree with the destruction .
too bad it was not permanent . " - e.p. coughlin " the artist must be given an opportunity to explain the intent and motivation for the creation of the work .
after this the rest of the world can debate the intent and whether one would support the display in their own neighborhood .
the destruction or defacing of art must be held as a criminal act with severe penalties . " - thomas clark " i see the act of the israeli ambassador as a strong political act .
i do not believe it is an attack against art itself , and the fact that he understood or not he meaning and intent of the artwork is meaningless .
i believe he used this piece as a simple opportunity to push his political views and make a slam .
i find it sad that the israeli political establishment is so violently attacking the rest of the planet , i.e. the vast majority of people -lrb- including most europeans -rrb- who observe that their politics are utterly blind and drive the middle east into a deep end .
i believe history will record sharon and his supporters as some of the worst politicians in israel .
instead of acting for the population ’ s good , they instead may be creating the conditions for the demise of israel .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers at a daimlerchrysler plant in mannheim .
the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .
employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strikers at a daimlerchrysler plant in mannheim .
the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

employers had offered a 1.2 percent pay increase over the next 27 months , but ig metall rejected it , saying it was far below the union ’ s demands of 4 percent increase over 12 months .
the employer ’ s association had also tied the pay raise to the introduction of contracts allowing for a flexible work " corridor " of between 35 and 40 hours without an increase in wage - a demand ig metall categorically rejected as a " slap in the face " and a " provocation . "

the return to a 40-hour work week , after unions had fought hard for reducing the week to between 35 and 38 hours , would cost the manufacturing sector at least 400,000 jobs , says ig metall vice president berthold huber .
the head of the gesamtmetall employers ' association , martin kannegiesser , has dismissed ig metall ’ s criticisms as proof that the union is not willing to be flexible and work with industry to establish tariff guidelines that would benefit economic recovery .
strikes dampen recovery several leading economic institutes are also of the opinion that the union ’ s warning strikes and insistence on a significant pay increases could endanger the still tentative signs of germany ’ s economic recovery .
according to a survey conducted by the berliner zeitung , the kiel institute for world economics -lrb- ifw kiel -rrb- and the hamburg institute of international economics -lrb- hwwa -rrb- have both criticized ig metall for putting jobs at risk .
roland dährn from the rhine-westphalia institute for economic research in essen said a wage increase of two percent would be ideal .
" that would encourage more hiring , " he told the newspaper .
a strike , however , would put everything on hold and slow down recovery , he said .
joachim scheide from ifw maintained that anything above a 2 percent pay raise would have a negative affect on the economy .
eckhardt wohlers from hwwa pointed out that ig metall wage tariffs were traditionally regarded as the model for negotiations in the rest of industry .
" when the metalworkers agree on more than 2 percent , it sends a sign to all other branches to do the same , " he said warning that an industry-wide increase would severely hinder germany ’ s competitive advantage and cost even more jobs at a time when the country is just beginning to pull itself out of recession . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de strike debacle plunges ig metall into disarray germany ’ s engineering union ig metall faced its biggest leadership crisis after it was embarrassingly forced to call off a strike to shorten working hours in the eastern part of the country . -lrb- july 1 , 2003 -rrb- eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers take to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

metal and electrical industry workers began warning strikes in several states thursday , after employers rejected union demands for a pay increase .
economists say the strikes could endanger the recovering economy . shortly after midnight workers across the country downed tools as part of a series of warning strikes organized by the country ’ s largest industrial union , ig metall .
representing around 3.4 million workers in the manufacturing sector , ig metall called for the strikes after several rounds of negotiations failed to bring about a new wage agreement .
early estimates say several thousand workers in baden-württemberg , bavaria , rhineland-palatinate , hesse , lower saxony and berlin participated in the selective work stoppages .
at the daimlerchrysler plant in sindelfingen in southwestern germany the assembly line came to a complete standstill as 1,000 employees stopped working for an hour .
the night shifts at several other major companies including bosch , epcos , infineon , osram and continental were also affected by the strikes .
ig metall says the round of warning strikes is scheduled to continue through the first week in february .
wage increase , fewer hours the union had threatened to organize warning strikes since talks with industry representatives unraveled late last week .

rsa security found that 66 % of the networks surveyed use the encryption system built-in to the wi-fi standard to help them prevent unauthorised access .
this is a big change since the last survey which found that only 37 % had the security system turned on .
despite this improvement , rsa said many firms were still making basic mistakes on wireless security and were leaving themselves open to attack .
free to air wireless networks have proved hugely popular with many businesses because they are so easy to set up and they eliminate the need for expensive cabling to give workers net access .

it found that many other networks are protected with other techniques that stop people outside a business using the net or getting access to internal networks .
but despite the good news , rsa said that many firms were still not doing the basics to ensure that they were protected .
about a quarter of the networks surveyed , almost 300 wi-fi access points , were poorly protected .
research author phil cracknell said that many firms used the default settings for wi-fi hardware they were installing making it easy for malicious hackers or criminals to eavesdrop or steal net access .
he said many departments could be buying their own networks and posing big problems for corporate security .
" the price of access points has fallen rapidly and can now be bought for as little as £ 140 - a purchase that could easily be made on expenses , " he said .

a pringles tube can help locate a wi-fi network the rsa survey found that the popularity of wireless networks has not been dimmed by the publicity about the technology 's security failings .
if found that the numbers of wireless networks being used by london businesses has risen by 235 % in the year since the last survey .
many are more secure than last year too and have the basic wired equivalent privacy -lrb- wep -rrb- system turned on .
this scrambles signals to make it harder to use a wi-fi network without permission .
it found that many other networks are protected with other techniques that stop people outside a business using the net or getting access to internal networks .
but despite the good news , rsa said that many firms were still not doing the basics to ensure that they were protected .
about a quarter of the networks surveyed , almost 300 wi-fi access points , were poorly protected .
research author phil cracknell said that many firms used the default settings for wi-fi hardware they were installing making it easy for malicious hackers or criminals to eavesdrop or steal net access .
he said many departments could be buying their own networks and posing big problems for corporate security .
" the price of access points has fallen rapidly and can now be bought for as little as £ 140 - a purchase that could easily be made on expenses , " he said .

chips-to-laptop makers nec and fujitsu both climbed back to quarterly profit , while at canon digital camera sales boosted full-year profits by 45 % .
nec reported october to december net profits of 11.1bn yen -lrb- $ 104m ; £ 57m -rrb- against a loss of 4.5bn yen a year ago .
fujitsu 's quarterly profit was 7.6bn yen against a 24bn yen loss in 2002 .
snap-happy consumers japan 's chip makers and electronic goods firms have shed thousands of jobs in recent years to get back in shape after being hit by sudden stagnation in demand for pcs and mobile phones coupled with the global economic downturn .
but consumers ' appetite for digital cameras , photo phones and flat screen tvs now seems to be driving the hi-tech sector .
earlier this month , leading us tech companies intel - the world 's biggest maker of computer chips - and computer-maker apple also reported improved business during the final quarter of 2003 .
nec 's return to profit was helped by strong sales of mobile handsets , where it has nearly a quarter of japan 's domestic market , and a 76 % jump in quarterly profits at its chip-making subsidiary nec electronics .
fujitsu makes screens and microchips used in flat screen tvs photo phones and digital cameras .
painful cure pays fujitsu has cut jobs and targeted software and outsourcing business , recently winning a £ 896m contract to manage british health service record-keeping systems .
canon , which sells one fifth of the world 's digital cameras , reported forecast-beating full-year 2003 net profits of 275.7bn yen , up 45 % from 2002 .
its 2003 sales rose by a more modest 8.8 % to 3.2 trillion yen .
toshiba was the japanese tech sector 's odd one out , failing to make a net profit in the october-to-december quarter .
toshiba , which produces laptops and memory cards for digital cameras , posted an increased quarterly net loss of 9.25bn yen , up from 6.90bn yen in the same period a year ago .
but toshiba said a change to its tax rules was to blame and that core operating profits rose to 14bn yen from 2.4bn yen in the comparable period .

several warders were injured during a riot at lincoln jail in october 2002 , and a 37-year-old inmate died from a drug overdose during the incident .
a report by the chief inspector of prisons , anne owers , has concluded that work is still needed to restore harmony at the victorian jail .
" lincoln has a long way to go to meet fully the inspectorate 's tests of a healthy prison , " ms owers said in the report .
