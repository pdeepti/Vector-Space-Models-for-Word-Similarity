it 's not a career-damaging move , as other leading german politicians have proven . always on the look-out for juicy stories to fill the summer news hole , editors at germany 's mass tabloid bild got lucky on tuesday : they came across a picture of two men in suits , talking to each other during the 50th birthday celebration for german opposition leader angela merkel . one of the men was guido westerwelle , who reportedly aspires to become germany 's next foreign minister should a center-right government rule the country after the 2006 elections .
the other was michael mronz , the executive director of an equestrian festival . " westerwelle loves this man , " read bild 's front-page headline the following day .
while neither of the men confirmed the relationship , they did n't deny it , either .
" i live my life and that 's all i 'm saying , " westerwelle told reporters .

it added that the public introduction of his boyfriend might also win him sympathy points with voters , many of whom see him as a cold careerist who is pushing for harsh and painful reforms of germany 's social welfare state .

" as a result , vw 's operating profit before special items fell by 19.8 percent to € 979 million in the january-june period .
at the bottom line , net profit was down 35.7 percent at € 383 million . although overall sales rose slightly , europe 's largest car manufacturer sustained a decline in unit sales in the united states where rivals were offering massive discounts to hold on to market share at a time when demand for new cars was shrinking . china sales also drop in the all-important chinese market , where vw is market leader , the company 's sales fell for the first time by 4.2 percent to 310,657 units . the decline was attributable to increasing competition , notably from vw 's arch-rival general motors , and the sharp increase in sales incentives from rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw lupo fsi looking ahead , vw said it was unlikely it would see " any substantial improvement through the second half of 2004 , mainly because of ongoing weak demand in key markets , unfavourable exchange rates , and the current high price of oil . " moreover there was unlikely to be any let up in competitive pressure in key markets , such as the us , europe and china . " we therefore forecast that growth in deliveries to customers in the second half of 2004 will be similar to that in the first half of the year , " vw said .
as a result , " our expected sales volume for the year as a whole , though up on the previous year , will fall well short of our original expectation .

only four ghanaians and one nigerian remain in italy . thursday ’ s deportation came after italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu told parliament that none of the africans were eligible for asylum . he said that there was “ no way round existing italian norms governing illegal entry into the country , ” but added that authorities were considering issuing some of the group with temporary residency permits on “ humanitarian grounds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refugees aboard the ship prior to entering italy pisanu also said that a “ scrupulous investigation by police ” had ascertained that none of the africans were refugees from sudan 's war-torn darfur region as some had originally claimed . italian 's criticize ship 's operators italy had refused to allow the german ship to enter a port in sicily for over a week but finally relented when pressure mounted .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .
but berlin 's support for india caused trouble in pakistan , new delhi 's archrival .
elsewhere , officials in china , bangladesh and sri lanka all remained reticent to commit on the issue . " when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .
but berlin 's support for india caused trouble in pakistan , new delhi 's archrival .
elsewhere , officials in china , bangladesh and sri lanka all remained reticent to commit on the issue . " when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .

now , a team of scientists involved in the € 3.6 million -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- eu research project promess1 -lrb- profiles across mediterranean sedimentary systems -rrb- are hoping to extend that understanding using ocean drilling techniques . the promess1 team has collected 500,000-year-old sediment cores from the bottom of the mediterranean sea .
these cores , which act like an archive of past climate developments , will allow scientists to reconstruct climate variations dating from pre-historic times , and hopefully , provide keys to better understand climate change now . the project involves partners from france , germany , italy , spain , the netherlands and the united kingdom . " the findings of the promess1 project place european research on a par with the world leaders in marine geosciences , the us and japan , " said european research commissioner philippe busquin .
" this research helps us to understand the earth 's situation and envisage scenarios to be taken into account by policy-makers . " complementing ice core data between june 24 and july 22 , the team of european scientists were on a drilling expedition in the mediterranean , which took them from brindisi , italy , to barcelona , spain , collecting long sediment cores of up to 300 meters .
the data collected from the cores will be compared with data provided from ice core drilling projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a climate researcher extracts a frozen ice core last month , the european commission presented the latest results of its ice core project in antarctica -lrb- epica -rrb- .
scientists there brought to the surface a 740,000-year-old ice core - the oldest ever analyzed .
the results will feed into computer models used to predict future climate changes . eu climate change researchers have found that over the last 740,000 years , the earth experienced eight ice ages , and eight warmer periods .
in the last 400,000 years , the warm periods have had a temperature similar to that of today .
however , carbon dioxide levels , which are known to contribute to global warming , are the highest they 've been in the last 440,000 years . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " environmental protection is thriving in germany " german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests .

now , a team of scientists involved in the € 3.6 million -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- eu research project promess1 -lrb- profiles across mediterranean sedimentary systems -rrb- are hoping to extend that understanding using ocean drilling techniques . the promess1 team has collected 500,000-year-old sediment cores from the bottom of the mediterranean sea .
these cores , which act like an archive of past climate developments , will allow scientists to reconstruct climate variations dating from pre-historic times , and hopefully , provide keys to better understand climate change now . the project involves partners from france , germany , italy , spain , the netherlands and the united kingdom . " the findings of the promess1 project place european research on a par with the world leaders in marine geosciences , the us and japan , " said european research commissioner philippe busquin .
" this research helps us to understand the earth 's situation and envisage scenarios to be taken into account by policy-makers . " complementing ice core data between june 24 and july 22 , the team of european scientists were on a drilling expedition in the mediterranean , which took them from brindisi , italy , to barcelona , spain , collecting long sediment cores of up to 300 meters .
the data collected from the cores will be compared with data provided from ice core drilling projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a climate researcher extracts a frozen ice core last month , the european commission presented the latest results of its ice core project in antarctica -lrb- epica -rrb- .
scientists there brought to the surface a 740,000-year-old ice core - the oldest ever analyzed .
the results will feed into computer models used to predict future climate changes . eu climate change researchers have found that over the last 740,000 years , the earth experienced eight ice ages , and eight warmer periods .
in the last 400,000 years , the warm periods have had a temperature similar to that of today .
however , carbon dioxide levels , which are known to contribute to global warming , are the highest they 've been in the last 440,000 years . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " environmental protection is thriving in germany " german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests .

" as a result , vw 's operating profit before special items fell by 19.8 percent to € 979 million in the january-june period .
at the bottom line , net profit was down 35.7 percent at € 383 million . although overall sales rose slightly , europe 's largest car manufacturer sustained a decline in unit sales in the united states where rivals were offering massive discounts to hold on to market share at a time when demand for new cars was shrinking . china sales also drop in the all-important chinese market , where vw is market leader , the company 's sales fell for the first time by 4.2 percent to 310,657 units . the decline was attributable to increasing competition , notably from vw 's arch-rival general motors , and the sharp increase in sales incentives from rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw lupo fsi looking ahead , vw said it was unlikely it would see " any substantial improvement through the second half of 2004 , mainly because of ongoing weak demand in key markets , unfavourable exchange rates , and the current high price of oil . " moreover there was unlikely to be any let up in competitive pressure in key markets , such as the us , europe and china . " we therefore forecast that growth in deliveries to customers in the second half of 2004 will be similar to that in the first half of the year , " vw said .
as a result , " our expected sales volume for the year as a whole , though up on the previous year , will fall well short of our original expectation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2004 out is in among german politicians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : " i live my life and that 's all i 'm going to say " guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party , has appeared in public with his boyfriend for the first time .
it 's not a career-damaging move , as other leading german politicians have proven . always on the look-out for juicy stories to fill the summer news hole , editors at germany 's mass tabloid bild got lucky on tuesday : they came across a picture of two men in suits , talking to each other during the 50th birthday celebration for german opposition leader angela merkel . one of the men was guido westerwelle , who reportedly aspires to become germany 's next foreign minister should a center-right government rule the country after the 2006 elections .
the other was michael mronz , the executive director of an equestrian festival . " westerwelle loves this man , " read bild 's front-page headline the following day .
while neither of the men confirmed the relationship , they did n't deny it , either .
" i live my life and that 's all i 'm saying , " westerwelle told reporters . " how gay is germany , " asked bild on the cover of its thursday edition in response - completing the package with a story on whether homosexuality is genetic and a commentary on why gay men are a woman 's best friends . a shrewd political move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 2002 elections , westerwelle toured germany with an rv called " guidomobil " and called his party " fun party . "
both the mobile home and the term have since been retired high-brow papers followed suit on thursday , delving into westerwelle 's apparent decision to end the secrecy surrounding his sexuality .
they pointed out that the fdp leader had been dropping hints for a while , accepting his inclusion in a book about gay celebrities and making ambiguous statements in interviews . careful observers might have also noticed that westerwelle has included madonna 's web site as one of his favorite links on his own home page . the berliner zeitung wondered whether westerwelle 's semi-voluntary outing was a way to clear out the private closet before possibly joining a cdu-led government as a cabinet minister .
it added that the public introduction of his boyfriend might also win him sympathy points with voters , many of whom see him as a cold careerist who is pushing for harsh and painful reforms of germany 's social welfare state . " he might have thought that he could revise this image by following the example of klaus wowereit and ole von beust , " the daily wrote .
" the mayors of berlin and hamburg have proven that being openly gay boosts rather than hurts popularity ratings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit -lrb- left -rrb- during the 2004 gay pride parade in berlin both wowereit -lrb- photo -rrb- , a social democrat , and beust , a christian democrat , won elections after their homosexuality became publicly known . " they score with voters because of their openness , " lothar probst , a political scientist at bremen university , told bild .
" those who discriminate against gay people on the other hand move themselves into the fringes of society . " winning elections during a 2001 televised speech prior to his election as mayor , wowereit famously said : " i 'm gay and that 's just fine . " he has since become germany 's most prominent gay politician , participating in berlin 's pride parade and other gay events .
most recently , wowereit and his partner officially welcomed newly elected german president horst köhler and his wife for an inaugural dinner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust beust 's public outing in 2003 was not quite as voluntary : ronald schill , a right-extremist cabinet member had threatened to expose the hamburg mayor 's homosexuality , prompting beust -lrb- photo -rrb- to fire him - and go on to win an unprecedented absolute majority in elections last february . schill plans to emigrate to south america in the fall . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls adoption for gay couples while some politicians in the us want to clamp down on rights for homosexuals , germany is considering expanding them .

" there 's a lot of frustration " among the singers in bayreuth , wottrich complained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endrik wottrich schlingensief , the 43-year-old self-styled enfant terrible of german theater , was simply trampling over wagner 's intentions , wottrich -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the staging was " an abomination " and the director and his dramaturge simply did not know the opera , according to the singer . when schlingensief had originally presented his ideas , " you could say , this will be good , this will be pleasant . "
but the director had not kept to his original concept and simply binned everything after his trip to africa , wottrich added . a big mistake ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief is known for controversial projects : during the 2004 venice biennale , he asked unemployed people belonging to a fictitious " church of fear " to sit on columns as saints .
while it had been extremely courageous of the festival 's director , wolfgang wagner , to take on schlingensief , who has never directed an opera before , in the first place , here was a man who only cared about his own whims and who pushed through his artistic freedom with legal means rather than any artistic authority , the tenor said . wottrich had even pulled out after just three days of rehearsal , but eventually agreed to come back " because you ca n't just find a parsifal on the streets . " nevertheless , the singer regretted it , he said . " i was stupid enough to give in , " he said .
" it was a big mistake .
i 've just been through the most unpleasant rehearsals in my life . " schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- meanwhile has said that he expects people to be upset after seeing his parsifal version . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief " i have to figure out where to hide afterwards , because a number of people will resent the production , " he told german magazine stern . the 93rd edition of the bayreuth festival , the annual month-long summer music festival dedicated exclusively to the works of composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- is scheduled to open on sunday with a gala performance of " parsifal " , directed by schlingensief and conducted by french composer and conductor pierre boulez . schlingensief 's new production has been making waves long before the curtain goes up , especially after the director publicly fell out with wolfgang wagner , the composer 's 84-year-old grandson . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayreuth makes room for a new generation the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .

" as a result , vw 's operating profit before special items fell by 19.8 percent to € 979 million in the january-june period .
at the bottom line , net profit was down 35.7 percent at € 383 million . although overall sales rose slightly , europe 's largest car manufacturer sustained a decline in unit sales in the united states where rivals were offering massive discounts to hold on to market share at a time when demand for new cars was shrinking . china sales also drop in the all-important chinese market , where vw is market leader , the company 's sales fell for the first time by 4.2 percent to 310,657 units . the decline was attributable to increasing competition , notably from vw 's arch-rival general motors , and the sharp increase in sales incentives from rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw lupo fsi looking ahead , vw said it was unlikely it would see " any substantial improvement through the second half of 2004 , mainly because of ongoing weak demand in key markets , unfavourable exchange rates , and the current high price of oil . " moreover there was unlikely to be any let up in competitive pressure in key markets , such as the us , europe and china . " we therefore forecast that growth in deliveries to customers in the second half of 2004 will be similar to that in the first half of the year , " vw said .
as a result , " our expected sales volume for the year as a whole , though up on the previous year , will fall well short of our original expectation .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .
but berlin 's support for india caused trouble in pakistan , new delhi 's archrival .
elsewhere , officials in china , bangladesh and sri lanka all remained reticent to commit on the issue . " when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .
" when is the right time is hard to say .
we will see .

-lrb- july 14 , 2004 -rrb- jockeying for a seat talk over reforms have replaced the war in iraq as the issue du jour at the un in new york .
germany is also pushing for one of its own : a permanent seat for berlin on the security council .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .
but berlin 's support for india caused trouble in pakistan , new delhi 's archrival .
elsewhere , officials in china , bangladesh and sri lanka all remained reticent to commit on the issue . " when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .
" when is the right time is hard to say .
we will see .

now , a team of scientists involved in the € 3.6 million -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- eu research project promess1 -lrb- profiles across mediterranean sedimentary systems -rrb- are hoping to extend that understanding using ocean drilling techniques . the promess1 team has collected 500,000-year-old sediment cores from the bottom of the mediterranean sea .
these cores , which act like an archive of past climate developments , will allow scientists to reconstruct climate variations dating from pre-historic times , and hopefully , provide keys to better understand climate change now . the project involves partners from france , germany , italy , spain , the netherlands and the united kingdom . " the findings of the promess1 project place european research on a par with the world leaders in marine geosciences , the us and japan , " said european research commissioner philippe busquin .
" this research helps us to understand the earth 's situation and envisage scenarios to be taken into account by policy-makers . " complementing ice core data between june 24 and july 22 , the team of european scientists were on a drilling expedition in the mediterranean , which took them from brindisi , italy , to barcelona , spain , collecting long sediment cores of up to 300 meters .
the data collected from the cores will be compared with data provided from ice core drilling projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a climate researcher extracts a frozen ice core last month , the european commission presented the latest results of its ice core project in antarctica -lrb- epica -rrb- .
scientists there brought to the surface a 740,000-year-old ice core - the oldest ever analyzed .
the results will feed into computer models used to predict future climate changes . eu climate change researchers have found that over the last 740,000 years , the earth experienced eight ice ages , and eight warmer periods .
in the last 400,000 years , the warm periods have had a temperature similar to that of today .

but european companies are unlikely to benefit . according to the financial times deutschland , us firms are expected to get most of the contracts as washington pays for most of iraq 's reconstruction . the lifting of the embargo became possible after the un security council recognized the new iraqi government in a resolution on june 8 . the move ended severe economic sanctions against baghdad , which were imposed 14 years ago .
under the trade embargo , the iraqis were only allowed to export oil to buy food , medicines and other civilian goods through a special un agency . us president george w. bush has issued an order stating that iraq should be treated like other friendly states , allowing the government in baghdad to order weapons and other military equipment . at the beginning of this week , eu leaders also lifted the weapons embargo against iraq , according to the financial times deutschland . german government officials meanwhile told the paper that permission still needs to be granted to export weapons .

but european companies are unlikely to benefit . according to the financial times deutschland , us firms are expected to get most of the contracts as washington pays for most of iraq 's reconstruction . the lifting of the embargo became possible after the un security council recognized the new iraqi government in a resolution on june 8 . the move ended severe economic sanctions against baghdad , which were imposed 14 years ago .
under the trade embargo , the iraqis were only allowed to export oil to buy food , medicines and other civilian goods through a special un agency . us president george w. bush has issued an order stating that iraq should be treated like other friendly states , allowing the government in baghdad to order weapons and other military equipment . at the beginning of this week , eu leaders also lifted the weapons embargo against iraq , according to the financial times deutschland . german government officials meanwhile told the paper that permission still needs to be granted to export weapons .
shipping arms to crisis regions will remain prohibited , but government officials did not want to say whether iraq would fall in that category . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies pin hopes on iraqi sovereignty german firms - excluded so far from u.s.-awarded contracts as punishment for berlin 's anti-war stance - are hopeful that the handover of power to the iraqi interim government will result in lucrative business deals .

it 's not a career-damaging move , as other leading german politicians have proven . always on the look-out for juicy stories to fill the summer news hole , editors at germany 's mass tabloid bild got lucky on tuesday : they came across a picture of two men in suits , talking to each other during the 50th birthday celebration for german opposition leader angela merkel . one of the men was guido westerwelle , who reportedly aspires to become germany 's next foreign minister should a center-right government rule the country after the 2006 elections .
the other was michael mronz , the executive director of an equestrian festival . " westerwelle loves this man , " read bild 's front-page headline the following day .
while neither of the men confirmed the relationship , they did n't deny it , either .
" i live my life and that 's all i 'm saying , " westerwelle told reporters . " how gay is germany , " asked bild on the cover of its thursday edition in response - completing the package with a story on whether homosexuality is genetic and a commentary on why gay men are a woman 's best friends . a shrewd political move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 2002 elections , westerwelle toured germany with an rv called " guidomobil " and called his party " fun party . "
both the mobile home and the term have since been retired high-brow papers followed suit on thursday , delving into westerwelle 's apparent decision to end the secrecy surrounding his sexuality .
they pointed out that the fdp leader had been dropping hints for a while , accepting his inclusion in a book about gay celebrities and making ambiguous statements in interviews . careful observers might have also noticed that westerwelle has included madonna 's web site as one of his favorite links on his own home page . the berliner zeitung wondered whether westerwelle 's semi-voluntary outing was a way to clear out the private closet before possibly joining a cdu-led government as a cabinet minister .
it added that the public introduction of his boyfriend might also win him sympathy points with voters , many of whom see him as a cold careerist who is pushing for harsh and painful reforms of germany 's social welfare state . " he might have thought that he could revise this image by following the example of klaus wowereit and ole von beust , " the daily wrote .
" the mayors of berlin and hamburg have proven that being openly gay boosts rather than hurts popularity ratings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit -lrb- left -rrb- during the 2004 gay pride parade in berlin both wowereit -lrb- photo -rrb- , a social democrat , and beust , a christian democrat , won elections after their homosexuality became publicly known . " they score with voters because of their openness , " lothar probst , a political scientist at bremen university , told bild .
" those who discriminate against gay people on the other hand move themselves into the fringes of society . " winning elections during a 2001 televised speech prior to his election as mayor , wowereit famously said : " i 'm gay and that 's just fine . " he has since become germany 's most prominent gay politician , participating in berlin 's pride parade and other gay events .
most recently , wowereit and his partner officially welcomed newly elected german president horst köhler and his wife for an inaugural dinner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust beust 's public outing in 2003 was not quite as voluntary : ronald schill , a right-extremist cabinet member had threatened to expose the hamburg mayor 's homosexuality , prompting beust -lrb- photo -rrb- to fire him - and go on to win an unprecedented absolute majority in elections last february . schill plans to emigrate to south america in the fall . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls adoption for gay couples while some politicians in the us want to clamp down on rights for homosexuals , germany is considering expanding them .

" as a result , vw 's operating profit before special items fell by 19.8 percent to € 979 million in the january-june period .
at the bottom line , net profit was down 35.7 percent at € 383 million . although overall sales rose slightly , europe 's largest car manufacturer sustained a decline in unit sales in the united states where rivals were offering massive discounts to hold on to market share at a time when demand for new cars was shrinking . china sales also drop in the all-important chinese market , where vw is market leader , the company 's sales fell for the first time by 4.2 percent to 310,657 units . the decline was attributable to increasing competition , notably from vw 's arch-rival general motors , and the sharp increase in sales incentives from rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw lupo fsi looking ahead , vw said it was unlikely it would see " any substantial improvement through the second half of 2004 , mainly because of ongoing weak demand in key markets , unfavourable exchange rates , and the current high price of oil . " moreover there was unlikely to be any let up in competitive pressure in key markets , such as the us , europe and china . " we therefore forecast that growth in deliveries to customers in the second half of 2004 will be similar to that in the first half of the year , " vw said .
as a result , " our expected sales volume for the year as a whole , though up on the previous year , will fall well short of our original expectation .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .
but berlin 's support for india caused trouble in pakistan , new delhi 's archrival .
elsewhere , officials in china , bangladesh and sri lanka all remained reticent to commit on the issue . " when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .
" when is the right time is hard to say .
we will see .

now , a team of scientists involved in the € 3.6 million -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- eu research project promess1 -lrb- profiles across mediterranean sedimentary systems -rrb- are hoping to extend that understanding using ocean drilling techniques . the promess1 team has collected 500,000-year-old sediment cores from the bottom of the mediterranean sea .
these cores , which act like an archive of past climate developments , will allow scientists to reconstruct climate variations dating from pre-historic times , and hopefully , provide keys to better understand climate change now . the project involves partners from france , germany , italy , spain , the netherlands and the united kingdom . " the findings of the promess1 project place european research on a par with the world leaders in marine geosciences , the us and japan , " said european research commissioner philippe busquin .
" this research helps us to understand the earth 's situation and envisage scenarios to be taken into account by policy-makers . " complementing ice core data between june 24 and july 22 , the team of european scientists were on a drilling expedition in the mediterranean , which took them from brindisi , italy , to barcelona , spain , collecting long sediment cores of up to 300 meters .
the data collected from the cores will be compared with data provided from ice core drilling projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a climate researcher extracts a frozen ice core last month , the european commission presented the latest results of its ice core project in antarctica -lrb- epica -rrb- .
scientists there brought to the surface a 740,000-year-old ice core - the oldest ever analyzed .
the results will feed into computer models used to predict future climate changes . eu climate change researchers have found that over the last 740,000 years , the earth experienced eight ice ages , and eight warmer periods .
in the last 400,000 years , the warm periods have had a temperature similar to that of today .

but european companies are unlikely to benefit . according to the financial times deutschland , us firms are expected to get most of the contracts as washington pays for most of iraq 's reconstruction . the lifting of the embargo became possible after the un security council recognized the new iraqi government in a resolution on june 8 . the move ended severe economic sanctions against baghdad , which were imposed 14 years ago .
under the trade embargo , the iraqis were only allowed to export oil to buy food , medicines and other civilian goods through a special un agency . us president george w. bush has issued an order stating that iraq should be treated like other friendly states , allowing the government in baghdad to order weapons and other military equipment . at the beginning of this week , eu leaders also lifted the weapons embargo against iraq , according to the financial times deutschland . german government officials meanwhile told the paper that permission still needs to be granted to export weapons .

" as a result , vw 's operating profit before special items fell by 19.8 percent to € 979 million in the january-june period .

" there 's a lot of frustration " among the singers in bayreuth , wottrich complained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endrik wottrich schlingensief , the 43-year-old self-styled enfant terrible of german theater , was simply trampling over wagner 's intentions , wottrich -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the staging was " an abomination " and the director and his dramaturge simply did not know the opera , according to the singer . when schlingensief had originally presented his ideas , " you could say , this will be good , this will be pleasant . "
but the director had not kept to his original concept and simply binned everything after his trip to africa , wottrich added . a big mistake ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief is known for controversial projects : during the 2004 venice biennale , he asked unemployed people belonging to a fictitious " church of fear " to sit on columns as saints .
while it had been extremely courageous of the festival 's director , wolfgang wagner , to take on schlingensief , who has never directed an opera before , in the first place , here was a man who only cared about his own whims and who pushed through his artistic freedom with legal means rather than any artistic authority , the tenor said . wottrich had even pulled out after just three days of rehearsal , but eventually agreed to come back " because you ca n't just find a parsifal on the streets . " nevertheless , the singer regretted it , he said . " i was stupid enough to give in , " he said .
" it was a big mistake .
i 've just been through the most unpleasant rehearsals in my life . " schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- meanwhile has said that he expects people to be upset after seeing his parsifal version . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief " i have to figure out where to hide afterwards , because a number of people will resent the production , " he told german magazine stern . the 93rd edition of the bayreuth festival , the annual month-long summer music festival dedicated exclusively to the works of composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- is scheduled to open on sunday with a gala performance of " parsifal " , directed by schlingensief and conducted by french composer and conductor pierre boulez . schlingensief 's new production has been making waves long before the curtain goes up , especially after the director publicly fell out with wolfgang wagner , the composer 's 84-year-old grandson . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayreuth makes room for a new generation the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .

the european court of human rights has now asked italy for details of its decision . twenty-seven africans who arrived in italy on july 12 on board the cap anamur ship operated by the german humanitarian organization of the same name were flown to ghana early friday .
five others had been deported tuesday night . the deportees were all part of a group of 37 africans , six from nigeria and 31 from ghana , who were rescued at sea by the german relief agency .
only four ghanaians and one nigerian remain in italy . thursday ’ s deportation came after italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu told parliament that none of the africans were eligible for asylum . he said that there was “ no way round existing italian norms governing illegal entry into the country , ” but added that authorities were considering issuing some of the group with temporary residency permits on “ humanitarian grounds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refugees aboard the ship prior to entering italy pisanu also said that a “ scrupulous investigation by police ” had ascertained that none of the africans were refugees from sudan 's war-torn darfur region as some had originally claimed . italian 's criticize ship 's operators italy had refused to allow the german ship to enter a port in sicily for over a week but finally relented when pressure mounted .
the africans who were being described by the ship ’ s crew as in a desperate state were finally allowed to disembark . pisanu blasted the german ship ’ s operators as “ capable manipulators ” of the media and said they were seeking “ the biggest possible return ” in publicity .
he added the german organization had repeatedly lied to italian authorities and tried to depict the country in a poor light abroad . last friday , the ship ’ s captain and first officer , together with the leader of cap anamur , were released after five days in italian custody .
the men had been arrested on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration . the italian government has come under continuing fire from the opposition and human rights groups for its handling of the affair .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .
but berlin 's support for india caused trouble in pakistan , new delhi 's archrival .
elsewhere , officials in china , bangladesh and sri lanka all remained reticent to commit on the issue . " when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .

" when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .
" when is the right time is hard to say .
we will see .

" there 's a lot of frustration " among the singers in bayreuth , wottrich complained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : endrik wottrich schlingensief , the 43-year-old self-styled enfant terrible of german theater , was simply trampling over wagner 's intentions , wottrich -lrb- photo -rrb- said . the staging was " an abomination " and the director and his dramaturge simply did not know the opera , according to the singer . when schlingensief had originally presented his ideas , " you could say , this will be good , this will be pleasant . "
but the director had not kept to his original concept and simply binned everything after his trip to africa , wottrich added . a big mistake ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schlingensief is known for controversial projects : during the 2004 venice biennale , he asked unemployed people belonging to a fictitious " church of fear " to sit on columns as saints .
while it had been extremely courageous of the festival 's director , wolfgang wagner , to take on schlingensief , who has never directed an opera before , in the first place , here was a man who only cared about his own whims and who pushed through his artistic freedom with legal means rather than any artistic authority , the tenor said . wottrich had even pulled out after just three days of rehearsal , but eventually agreed to come back " because you ca n't just find a parsifal on the streets . " nevertheless , the singer regretted it , he said . " i was stupid enough to give in , " he said .
" it was a big mistake .
i 've just been through the most unpleasant rehearsals in my life . " schlingensief -lrb- photo -rrb- meanwhile has said that he expects people to be upset after seeing his parsifal version . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph schlingensief " i have to figure out where to hide afterwards , because a number of people will resent the production , " he told german magazine stern . the 93rd edition of the bayreuth festival , the annual month-long summer music festival dedicated exclusively to the works of composer richard wagner -lrb- 1813-1883 -rrb- is scheduled to open on sunday with a gala performance of " parsifal " , directed by schlingensief and conducted by french composer and conductor pierre boulez . schlingensief 's new production has been making waves long before the curtain goes up , especially after the director publicly fell out with wolfgang wagner , the composer 's 84-year-old grandson . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayreuth makes room for a new generation the bayreuth festival will feature more unconventional young directors in 2003 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2004 out is in among german politicians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : " i live my life and that 's all i 'm going to say " guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party , has appeared in public with his boyfriend for the first time .
it 's not a career-damaging move , as other leading german politicians have proven . always on the look-out for juicy stories to fill the summer news hole , editors at germany 's mass tabloid bild got lucky on tuesday : they came across a picture of two men in suits , talking to each other during the 50th birthday celebration for german opposition leader angela merkel . one of the men was guido westerwelle , who reportedly aspires to become germany 's next foreign minister should a center-right government rule the country after the 2006 elections .
the other was michael mronz , the executive director of an equestrian festival . " westerwelle loves this man , " read bild 's front-page headline the following day .
while neither of the men confirmed the relationship , they did n't deny it , either .
" i live my life and that 's all i 'm saying , " westerwelle told reporters . " how gay is germany , " asked bild on the cover of its thursday edition in response - completing the package with a story on whether homosexuality is genetic and a commentary on why gay men are a woman 's best friends . a shrewd political move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 2002 elections , westerwelle toured germany with an rv called " guidomobil " and called his party " fun party . "
both the mobile home and the term have since been retired high-brow papers followed suit on thursday , delving into westerwelle 's apparent decision to end the secrecy surrounding his sexuality .
they pointed out that the fdp leader had been dropping hints for a while , accepting his inclusion in a book about gay celebrities and making ambiguous statements in interviews . careful observers might have also noticed that westerwelle has included madonna 's web site as one of his favorite links on his own home page . the berliner zeitung wondered whether westerwelle 's semi-voluntary outing was a way to clear out the private closet before possibly joining a cdu-led government as a cabinet minister .
it added that the public introduction of his boyfriend might also win him sympathy points with voters , many of whom see him as a cold careerist who is pushing for harsh and painful reforms of germany 's social welfare state . " he might have thought that he could revise this image by following the example of klaus wowereit and ole von beust , " the daily wrote .
" the mayors of berlin and hamburg have proven that being openly gay boosts rather than hurts popularity ratings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit -lrb- left -rrb- during the 2004 gay pride parade in berlin both wowereit -lrb- photo -rrb- , a social democrat , and beust , a christian democrat , won elections after their homosexuality became publicly known . " they score with voters because of their openness , " lothar probst , a political scientist at bremen university , told bild .
" those who discriminate against gay people on the other hand move themselves into the fringes of society . " winning elections during a 2001 televised speech prior to his election as mayor , wowereit famously said : " i 'm gay and that 's just fine . " he has since become germany 's most prominent gay politician , participating in berlin 's pride parade and other gay events .
most recently , wowereit and his partner officially welcomed newly elected german president horst köhler and his wife for an inaugural dinner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust beust 's public outing in 2003 was not quite as voluntary : ronald schill , a right-extremist cabinet member had threatened to expose the hamburg mayor 's homosexuality , prompting beust -lrb- photo -rrb- to fire him - and go on to win an unprecedented absolute majority in elections last february . schill plans to emigrate to south america in the fall . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany mulls adoption for gay couples while some politicians in the us want to clamp down on rights for homosexuals , germany is considering expanding them .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .

the european court of human rights has now asked italy for details of its decision . twenty-seven africans who arrived in italy on july 12 on board the cap anamur ship operated by the german humanitarian organization of the same name were flown to ghana early friday .
five others had been deported tuesday night . the deportees were all part of a group of 37 africans , six from nigeria and 31 from ghana , who were rescued at sea by the german relief agency .
only four ghanaians and one nigerian remain in italy . thursday ’ s deportation came after italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu told parliament that none of the africans were eligible for asylum . he said that there was “ no way round existing italian norms governing illegal entry into the country , ” but added that authorities were considering issuing some of the group with temporary residency permits on “ humanitarian grounds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refugees aboard the ship prior to entering italy pisanu also said that a “ scrupulous investigation by police ” had ascertained that none of the africans were refugees from sudan 's war-torn darfur region as some had originally claimed . italian 's criticize ship 's operators italy had refused to allow the german ship to enter a port in sicily for over a week but finally relented when pressure mounted .
the africans who were being described by the ship ’ s crew as in a desperate state were finally allowed to disembark . pisanu blasted the german ship ’ s operators as “ capable manipulators ” of the media and said they were seeking “ the biggest possible return ” in publicity .
he added the german organization had repeatedly lied to italian authorities and tried to depict the country in a poor light abroad . last friday , the ship ’ s captain and first officer , together with the leader of cap anamur , were released after five days in italian custody .
the men had been arrested on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration . the italian government has come under continuing fire from the opposition and human rights groups for its handling of the affair .

at the bottom line , net profit was down 35.7 percent at € 383 million . although overall sales rose slightly , europe 's largest car manufacturer sustained a decline in unit sales in the united states where rivals were offering massive discounts to hold on to market share at a time when demand for new cars was shrinking . china sales also drop in the all-important chinese market , where vw is market leader , the company 's sales fell for the first time by 4.2 percent to 310,657 units . the decline was attributable to increasing competition , notably from vw 's arch-rival general motors , and the sharp increase in sales incentives from rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw lupo fsi looking ahead , vw said it was unlikely it would see " any substantial improvement through the second half of 2004 , mainly because of ongoing weak demand in key markets , unfavourable exchange rates , and the current high price of oil . " moreover there was unlikely to be any let up in competitive pressure in key markets , such as the us , europe and china . " we therefore forecast that growth in deliveries to customers in the second half of 2004 will be similar to that in the first half of the year , " vw said .
as a result , " our expected sales volume for the year as a whole , though up on the previous year , will fall well short of our original expectation . " dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de volkswagen faces " miserable " earnings vw blamed a sluggish auto market , the poor german economy and the weak dollar for a sharp downturn in profits .

the firm 's top managers will contribute to the savings by giving up part of their salaries . after two weeks of protests and strikes , daimlerchrysler hammered out an agreement that will save the carmaker € 500 million -lrb- us $ 612 million -rrb- in annual labor costs .
in return , daimlerchrysler said it will guarantee the jobs at the sindelfingen plant near stuttgart until 2012 . " the agreement sets the course for increased productivity and efficiency and so strengthens the long-term competitiveness of the mercedes car group , " mercedes chief jürgen hubbert said . german chancellor gerhard schröder greeted the deal as " a victory for common sense " which would help strengthen germany 's economic recovery .
schröder also said the deal would set a precedent for savings negotiations at rival carmaker volkswagen .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .

" we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .

" as a result , vw 's operating profit before special items fell by 19.8 percent to € 979 million in the january-june period .
at the bottom line , net profit was down 35.7 percent at € 383 million . although overall sales rose slightly , europe 's largest car manufacturer sustained a decline in unit sales in the united states where rivals were offering massive discounts to hold on to market share at a time when demand for new cars was shrinking . china sales also drop in the all-important chinese market , where vw is market leader , the company 's sales fell for the first time by 4.2 percent to 310,657 units . the decline was attributable to increasing competition , notably from vw 's arch-rival general motors , and the sharp increase in sales incentives from rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw lupo fsi looking ahead , vw said it was unlikely it would see " any substantial improvement through the second half of 2004 , mainly because of ongoing weak demand in key markets , unfavourable exchange rates , and the current high price of oil . " moreover there was unlikely to be any let up in competitive pressure in key markets , such as the us , europe and china . " we therefore forecast that growth in deliveries to customers in the second half of 2004 will be similar to that in the first half of the year , " vw said .
as a result , " our expected sales volume for the year as a whole , though up on the previous year , will fall well short of our original expectation .

he added the german organization had repeatedly lied to italian authorities and tried to depict the country in a poor light abroad . last friday , the ship ’ s captain and first officer , together with the leader of cap anamur , were released after five days in italian custody .
the men had been arrested on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration . the italian government has come under continuing fire from the opposition and human rights groups for its handling of the affair .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .
but berlin 's support for india caused trouble in pakistan , new delhi 's archrival .
elsewhere , officials in china , bangladesh and sri lanka all remained reticent to commit on the issue . " when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .

prime minister tony blair has postponed a cabinet reshuffle because the man who has been offered the job , former cabinet minister peter mandelson , was unable to make up his mind whether to accept the job .
according to the financial times , mandelson , who has twice been forced to resign from the cabinet , has already been offered the post by blair .
however , he was in two minds whether to take it because there was still a chance that he might get back into the cabinet .
a close blair ally , mandelson has been both the northern ireland secretary and trade and industry secretary .
he was forced to leave cabinet twice after being accused of improper financial dealings .
some believe that if mandelson is nominated it will play into the hands of the euroskeptics , who insist that brussels is just a home for washed-up politicians .

prime minister tony blair has postponed a cabinet reshuffle because the man who has been offered the job , former cabinet minister peter mandelson , was unable to make up his mind whether to accept the job .
according to the financial times , mandelson , who has twice been forced to resign from the cabinet , has already been offered the post by blair .
however , he was in two minds whether to take it because there was still a chance that he might get back into the cabinet .
a close blair ally , mandelson has been both the northern ireland secretary and trade and industry secretary .
he was forced to leave cabinet twice after being accused of improper financial dealings .
some believe that if mandelson is nominated it will play into the hands of the euroskeptics , who insist that brussels is just a home for washed-up politicians .
" the nomination of a man who has twice been forced out of the cabinet would be a gift to euroskeptics " , said uk liberal member of the european parliament chris davies .

shipping arms to crisis regions will remain prohibited , but government officials did not want to say whether iraq would fall in that category . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german companies pin hopes on iraqi sovereignty german firms - excluded so far from u.s.-awarded contracts as punishment for berlin 's anti-war stance - are hopeful that the handover of power to the iraqi interim government will result in lucrative business deals .

according to czech media , telicka is being rejected as a member of the next eu executive by one of the czech governing parties , the christian democrats , because of his former membership of the czech communist party .
the christian democrats are now looking to spidla , a social democrat who resigned as prime minister in june following a major defeat of his party in the european elections .
spidla can count on the support from his own party , as well as from the opposition right-wing ods .
the outgoing prime minister said on friday he would accept an official offer to become a new czech eu commissioner .
" if i receive such an offer , i will not reject it " , spidla told the press agency ctk .
but some czech politicians fear that brussels would not appreciate the move .

after a german judge acquitted all defendants of charges of breach of trust in the mannesmann trial , prosecutors said friday they would appeal the decision .
politicians meanwhile mulled legislative consequences . prosecutors have taken the appeal to the federal court of justice , the country 's highest criminal court , a spokeswoman said on friday .
they had called for prison terms for several of the defendants , including deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann , who had been accused of approving unreasonable severance packages for mannesmann top executives as a member of the company 's board of trustees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the federal court of justice , the country 's highest criminal court , is located in karlsruhe in southwestern germany on thursday , düsseldorf district court judge brigitte koppenhöfer had ruled that the defendants , which also included former mannesmann ceo klaus esser and the former head of german trade union ig metall , klaus zwickel , were not quilty of the charges . the mannesmann board had approved 111.5 million deutsche marks -lrb- $ 71 million -rrb- in bonuses to management board members during the multi-billion-euro takeover of mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
esser alone got more than € 15 million . calls for more transparency the verdict also provoked german politicians to consider changes in the law to prevent similar cases in the future . members of the neoliberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- called for more transparency in germany 's stock corporation and criminal law . " the spongy criteria of what constitutes a breach of trust have to be defined more clearly , " rainer funke , the party 's legal expert in parliament , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
he added that the law should also clarify what constitutes an " adequate compensation " for top executives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but german justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- said she did n't support proposals to establish legal limits for top salaries . " the constitution prohibits us from determining what people can earn in private business , " she said in an interview with german public radio broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
" i also would n't write into law how much a skilled worker can earn . " but zypries agreed that a need for more transparency existed .
one possibility to deal with the issue could be a voluntary requirement for companies to link salaries to the overall wage development at the firm . strengthening shareholders ' rights the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- minister also said she planned on strengthening shareholders ' rights to sue companies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shareholders at a company 's annual meeting " our goal is to allow a minority of shareholders to take the company to court to assert their claims , " she said .

now , a team of scientists involved in the € 3.6 million -lrb- $ 4.3 million -rrb- eu research project promess1 -lrb- profiles across mediterranean sedimentary systems -rrb- are hoping to extend that understanding using ocean drilling techniques . the promess1 team has collected 500,000-year-old sediment cores from the bottom of the mediterranean sea .
these cores , which act like an archive of past climate developments , will allow scientists to reconstruct climate variations dating from pre-historic times , and hopefully , provide keys to better understand climate change now . the project involves partners from france , germany , italy , spain , the netherlands and the united kingdom . " the findings of the promess1 project place european research on a par with the world leaders in marine geosciences , the us and japan , " said european research commissioner philippe busquin .
" this research helps us to understand the earth 's situation and envisage scenarios to be taken into account by policy-makers . " complementing ice core data between june 24 and july 22 , the team of european scientists were on a drilling expedition in the mediterranean , which took them from brindisi , italy , to barcelona , spain , collecting long sediment cores of up to 300 meters .
the data collected from the cores will be compared with data provided from ice core drilling projects . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a climate researcher extracts a frozen ice core last month , the european commission presented the latest results of its ice core project in antarctica -lrb- epica -rrb- .
scientists there brought to the surface a 740,000-year-old ice core - the oldest ever analyzed .
the results will feed into computer models used to predict future climate changes . eu climate change researchers have found that over the last 740,000 years , the earth experienced eight ice ages , and eight warmer periods .
in the last 400,000 years , the warm periods have had a temperature similar to that of today .
however , carbon dioxide levels , which are known to contribute to global warming , are the highest they 've been in the last 440,000 years . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " environmental protection is thriving in germany " german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests .

" as a result , vw 's operating profit before special items fell by 19.8 percent to € 979 million in the january-june period .
at the bottom line , net profit was down 35.7 percent at € 383 million . although overall sales rose slightly , europe 's largest car manufacturer sustained a decline in unit sales in the united states where rivals were offering massive discounts to hold on to market share at a time when demand for new cars was shrinking . china sales also drop in the all-important chinese market , where vw is market leader , the company 's sales fell for the first time by 4.2 percent to 310,657 units . the decline was attributable to increasing competition , notably from vw 's arch-rival general motors , and the sharp increase in sales incentives from rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw lupo fsi looking ahead , vw said it was unlikely it would see " any substantial improvement through the second half of 2004 , mainly because of ongoing weak demand in key markets , unfavourable exchange rates , and the current high price of oil . " moreover there was unlikely to be any let up in competitive pressure in key markets , such as the us , europe and china . " we therefore forecast that growth in deliveries to customers in the second half of 2004 will be similar to that in the first half of the year , " vw said .
as a result , " our expected sales volume for the year as a whole , though up on the previous year , will fall well short of our original expectation .

the men had been arrested on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration . the italian government has come under continuing fire from the opposition and human rights groups for its handling of the affair .

" right now there 's no sign of that happening , " antje hermenau , the greens ' budget expert in parliament , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
she added that it would take until the fall until estimates of germany 's new debt could be made .
the government 's five-member panel of independent economic experts , known here as the " wise men , " had previously said they expected the deficit to come in at just under 4 percent of gross domestic product .
in 2003 , the deficit had been 3.9 percent and experts had previously expected a 2004 deficit of 3.4 percent .
germany has been facing sanctions from the eu for failing to adhere to the union 's stability and growth pact , which requires members of the euro zone to keep deficits below 3 percent of gdp . dw-world.de massive budget hole hits government hard a panel of fiscal experts on thursday delivered the bad news everyone expected : over the next three years , germany will see tax shortfalls of € 61 billion -lrb- $ 72 billion -rrb- , posing huge problems domestically and for europe .

the european court of human rights has now asked italy for details of its decision . twenty-seven africans who arrived in italy on july 12 on board the cap anamur ship operated by the german humanitarian organization of the same name were flown to ghana early friday .
five others had been deported tuesday night . the deportees were all part of a group of 37 africans , six from nigeria and 31 from ghana , who were rescued at sea by the german relief agency .
only four ghanaians and one nigerian remain in italy . thursday ’ s deportation came after italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu told parliament that none of the africans were eligible for asylum . he said that there was “ no way round existing italian norms governing illegal entry into the country , ” but added that authorities were considering issuing some of the group with temporary residency permits on “ humanitarian grounds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refugees aboard the ship prior to entering italy pisanu also said that a “ scrupulous investigation by police ” had ascertained that none of the africans were refugees from sudan 's war-torn darfur region as some had originally claimed . italian 's criticize ship 's operators italy had refused to allow the german ship to enter a port in sicily for over a week but finally relented when pressure mounted .
the africans who were being described by the ship ’ s crew as in a desperate state were finally allowed to disembark . pisanu blasted the german ship ’ s operators as “ capable manipulators ” of the media and said they were seeking “ the biggest possible return ” in publicity .
he added the german organization had repeatedly lied to italian authorities and tried to depict the country in a poor light abroad . last friday , the ship ’ s captain and first officer , together with the leader of cap anamur , were released after five days in italian custody .
the men had been arrested on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration . the italian government has come under continuing fire from the opposition and human rights groups for its handling of the affair .

" as a result , vw 's operating profit before special items fell by 19.8 percent to € 979 million in the january-june period .
at the bottom line , net profit was down 35.7 percent at € 383 million . although overall sales rose slightly , europe 's largest car manufacturer sustained a decline in unit sales in the united states where rivals were offering massive discounts to hold on to market share at a time when demand for new cars was shrinking . china sales also drop in the all-important chinese market , where vw is market leader , the company 's sales fell for the first time by 4.2 percent to 310,657 units . the decline was attributable to increasing competition , notably from vw 's arch-rival general motors , and the sharp increase in sales incentives from rivals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw lupo fsi looking ahead , vw said it was unlikely it would see " any substantial improvement through the second half of 2004 , mainly because of ongoing weak demand in key markets , unfavourable exchange rates , and the current high price of oil . " moreover there was unlikely to be any let up in competitive pressure in key markets , such as the us , europe and china . " we therefore forecast that growth in deliveries to customers in the second half of 2004 will be similar to that in the first half of the year , " vw said .
as a result , " our expected sales volume for the year as a whole , though up on the previous year , will fall well short of our original expectation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2004 fischer finds few backers for un seat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kadirgamar and fischer measure support for berlin 's un bid german foreign minister joschka fischer wrapped up his 10-day trip to asia on friday .
aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .
but berlin 's support for india caused trouble in pakistan , new delhi 's archrival .
elsewhere , officials in china , bangladesh and sri lanka all remained reticent to commit on the issue . " when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .

aside from india , his efforts to gain support for a permanent german seat on the un security council met with a lukewarm reception . on his longest ever official trip , fischer travelled to india , china , pakistan , bangladesh and sri lanka to discuss regional and bilateral issues , as well as berlin 's desire to get permanent seat on the security council . however , only during fischer 's first stop in india , which also wants a security council seat , did he receive solid backing for germany 's own efforts .
but berlin 's support for india caused trouble in pakistan , new delhi 's archrival .
elsewhere , officials in china , bangladesh and sri lanka all remained reticent to commit on the issue . " when it comes to the specifics of who is going to fill the seats we are not ready to take a position yet , " sri lankan foreign minister lakshman kadirgamar said . earlier this year , chancellor gerhard schröder declared germany 's desire to become a permanent member on the security council . garnering support with the security council 's five permanent veto-wielding members - france , england , america , china and russia - still representing the world of 1945 , there is broad agreement that an overhaul is overdue . but any reform will require a two-thirds majority of the 191-member un general assembly . " we hope that if there is reform of the un security council that we will get the support of our friends , what we need is an efficient multilateral system , " fischer said while in the bangladeshi capital dhaka . but the current permanent members can veto any vote , and fischer may not have done berlin 's bid any favors in beijing .
while there he criticized china 's human rights record .
but perhaps getting chinese support will be easier than convincing germany 's old ally the united states to back berlin . earlier this month , the financial times deutschland reported that washington opposed germany 's efforts because of its opposition to the war against iraq .
the paper quoted an unnamed us administration official as saying berlin had been a problem during its current stint on the security council . " now is not the time for germany to apply for a permanent seat , " the official told the paper .

the european court of human rights has now asked italy for details of its decision . twenty-seven africans who arrived in italy on july 12 on board the cap anamur ship operated by the german humanitarian organization of the same name were flown to ghana early friday .
five others had been deported tuesday night . the deportees were all part of a group of 37 africans , six from nigeria and 31 from ghana , who were rescued at sea by the german relief agency .
only four ghanaians and one nigerian remain in italy . thursday ’ s deportation came after italian interior minister giuseppe pisanu told parliament that none of the africans were eligible for asylum . he said that there was “ no way round existing italian norms governing illegal entry into the country , ” but added that authorities were considering issuing some of the group with temporary residency permits on “ humanitarian grounds . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the refugees aboard the ship prior to entering italy pisanu also said that a “ scrupulous investigation by police ” had ascertained that none of the africans were refugees from sudan 's war-torn darfur region as some had originally claimed . italian 's criticize ship 's operators italy had refused to allow the german ship to enter a port in sicily for over a week but finally relented when pressure mounted .
the africans who were being described by the ship ’ s crew as in a desperate state were finally allowed to disembark . pisanu blasted the german ship ’ s operators as “ capable manipulators ” of the media and said they were seeking “ the biggest possible return ” in publicity .
he added the german organization had repeatedly lied to italian authorities and tried to depict the country in a poor light abroad . last friday , the ship ’ s captain and first officer , together with the leader of cap anamur , were released after five days in italian custody .
the men had been arrested on suspicion of aiding illegal immigration . the italian government has come under continuing fire from the opposition and human rights groups for its handling of the affair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.07.2004 out is in among german politicians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle : " i live my life and that 's all i 'm going to say " guido westerwelle , the leader of germany 's neoliberal free democratic party , has appeared in public with his boyfriend for the first time .
it 's not a career-damaging move , as other leading german politicians have proven . always on the look-out for juicy stories to fill the summer news hole , editors at germany 's mass tabloid bild got lucky on tuesday : they came across a picture of two men in suits , talking to each other during the 50th birthday celebration for german opposition leader angela merkel . one of the men was guido westerwelle , who reportedly aspires to become germany 's next foreign minister should a center-right government rule the country after the 2006 elections .
the other was michael mronz , the executive director of an equestrian festival . " westerwelle loves this man , " read bild 's front-page headline the following day .
while neither of the men confirmed the relationship , they did n't deny it , either .
" i live my life and that 's all i 'm saying , " westerwelle told reporters . " how gay is germany , " asked bild on the cover of its thursday edition in response - completing the package with a story on whether homosexuality is genetic and a commentary on why gay men are a woman 's best friends . a shrewd political move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : during the 2002 elections , westerwelle toured germany with an rv called " guidomobil " and called his party " fun party . "
both the mobile home and the term have since been retired high-brow papers followed suit on thursday , delving into westerwelle 's apparent decision to end the secrecy surrounding his sexuality .
they pointed out that the fdp leader had been dropping hints for a while , accepting his inclusion in a book about gay celebrities and making ambiguous statements in interviews . careful observers might have also noticed that westerwelle has included madonna 's web site as one of his favorite links on his own home page . the berliner zeitung wondered whether westerwelle 's semi-voluntary outing was a way to clear out the private closet before possibly joining a cdu-led government as a cabinet minister .
it added that the public introduction of his boyfriend might also win him sympathy points with voters , many of whom see him as a cold careerist who is pushing for harsh and painful reforms of germany 's social welfare state . " he might have thought that he could revise this image by following the example of klaus wowereit and ole von beust , " the daily wrote .
" the mayors of berlin and hamburg have proven that being openly gay boosts rather than hurts popularity ratings . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit -lrb- left -rrb- during the 2004 gay pride parade in berlin both wowereit -lrb- photo -rrb- , a social democrat , and beust , a christian democrat , won elections after their homosexuality became publicly known . " they score with voters because of their openness , " lothar probst , a political scientist at bremen university , told bild .
" those who discriminate against gay people on the other hand move themselves into the fringes of society . " winning elections during a 2001 televised speech prior to his election as mayor , wowereit famously said : " i 'm gay and that 's just fine . " he has since become germany 's most prominent gay politician , participating in berlin 's pride parade and other gay events .

an announcement could come after the prime minister tony blair speaks to new president of the european commission , jose manuel durao barroso later today .
mr mandelson , one of mr blair 's closest allies , has resigned twice from the cabinet in controversial circumstances , most recently in 2001 .
breakfast had more throughout friday 's programme we spoke to the liberal democrats ' norman baker and from labour 's keith vaz , a former europe minister click here for your comments on peter mandelson enlargement if mr mandelson 's appointment is confirmed , then it will prompt a by-election in hartlepool - mr mandelson 's constituency .
the appointment to the european commission would come ahead of what could be a lengthy run-up to a referendum on the new european constitution .
britain 's two current commissioners , ex-labour leader neil kinnock and former tory chairman chris patten , are stepping down .
eu enlargement means britain will now have only one commissioner .
speculation has been growing for weeks , but downing street has refused to confirm the reports .
if the appointment is made , it would signal a remarkable comeback for mr mandelson , who has been both trade and northern ireland secretary .
he has twice resigned from the cabinet in the controversy : over a home loan in 1998 and because of the hinduja passports affair in 2001 .
' good names ' mr durao barroso appeared to suggest he had asked for a list of possible nominees for the post from mr blair .
asked whether he would find the nomination of mr mandelson acceptable , he told bbc 's newsnight : " of course the process of selection ... it is the responsibility of the heads of government and the president of the commission .
i hope that the prime minister of britain presents me with good names -lrb- for the post -rrb- because i think it is very important for europe to have the best in the european commission jose manuel durao barroso " so far i have not yet spoken to the prime minister of great britain about the commissioner and i will not make any comment at this stage .
" i hope that the prime minister of britain presents me with good names because i think it is very important for europe to have the best in the european commission . "
mr mandelson 's appointment would delay the need for a cabinet re-shuffle , at least until autumn , bbc political reporter gary o 'donoghue said .
hartlepool should be a safe seat for labour , but after losing leicester south to the liberal democrats and nearly losing birmingham hodge hill in by-elections last week , the outcome is not being taken for granted , he added .
the liberal democrats have already printed material for a campaign in hartlepool , according to the bbc 's political correspondent martha kearney .

mencap cymru cite the case of stephen thomas , 25 , of prestatyn , who has down 's syndrome , has studied politics and had chosen his candidate .
but he was told there was nobody to help him read the ballot papers .
denbighshire council says it is investigating but disputes the family 's version of events .
at the polling booth , mr thomas ' parents say they were asked if he was capable of voting at all .
officials said there was no-one available to help him read the ballot papers so he could cast his vote .
mr thomas said : " i 'm feeling upset about it .
" i could n't go for the vote .
i ca n't understand the questions . "
i was embarrassed , upset and angry " susan thomas " people can help me by reading the questions to me . "
mr thomas ' mother susan told bbc wales she was very embarrassed by the situation .
" everybody was looking and listening to what was going on .
" we had no privacy whatsoever .
we just wanted to get out of there .
" when we got there , i handed my card in and asked would it be alright for stephen to vote .
" the returning officer asked if he 'd be able to understand the questions .
" i said i did n't know , it was his first time .
" i asked would i be able to help him , not to influence him , but to help him read the questions . "
she was told no , and that the returning officer could not read the questions either .
" by this time , the queue of voters was getting longer - they were looking and listening to everything that was going on .
" i was embarrassed , upset and angry . "
" the electoral staff state categorically that the young man was not refused a vote , and i would not accept the suggestion that he was treated unfairly " ian miller the charity has said mr thomas ' case was not unique .
they say they have several other incidences of people with learning disabilities being unable to vote because the necessary help was not offered at polling stations .
mencap cymru has lodged an official complaint with denbighshire council over mr thomas ' claims .
' not refused ' denbighshire 's chief executive and returning officer ian miller has investigated the complaint and is due to respond to the charity shortly .
he said : " many elements of the complaint are not borne out by the evidence from the electoral staff .
" in particular , the electoral staff state categorically that the young man was not refused a vote , and i would not accept the suggestion that he was treated unfairly .
" there are clear rules in electoral law about formal questions that are put to a person in cases where there is doubt about the identity of the individual .
" the questions can also be used if there is doubt about a person 's ability to understand the process , for example if someone appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol .
" in this case , the young man 's mother appears to have decided herself that her son was not going to vote before electoral staff had the chance to put the formal questions to him . "

" by this time , the queue of voters was getting longer - they were looking and listening to everything that was going on .
" i was embarrassed , upset and angry . "
the electoral staff state categorically that the young man was not refused a vote , and i would not accept the suggestion that he was treated unfairly ian miller the charity has said mr thomas ' case was not unique .
they say they have several other incidences of people with learning disabilities being unable to vote because the necessary help was not offered at polling stations .
mencap cymru has lodged an official complaint with denbighshire council over mr thomas ' claims .
' not refused ' denbighshire 's chief executive and returning officer ian miller has investigated the complaint and is due to respond to the charity shortly .
he said : " many elements of the complaint are not borne out by the evidence from the electoral staff .
" in particular , the electoral staff state categorically that the young man was not refused a vote , and i would not accept the suggestion that he was treated unfairly .
" there are clear rules in electoral law about formal questions that are put to a person in cases where there is doubt about the identity of the individual .
" the questions can also be used if there is doubt about a person 's ability to understand the process , for example if someone appears to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol .
" in this case , the young man 's mother appears to have decided herself that her son was not going to vote before electoral staff had the chance to put the formal questions to him . "

nine specialist rape centres in england and wales are conducting the first ever official research into the problem .
senior police officers have expressed concerns that there are no genuine statistics on drug assisted rape .
for the study , in cases where a victim alleges or police officers suspect drugs have played a part , screening for a range of chemicals will take place .
derbyshire cid 's detective chief superintendent dave gee , who is spearheading the initiative called operation matise , said : " there is a lack of valid data around which actually shows the prevalence of this kind of offence .
" what we are trying to do is put together some empirical data which will actually tell us the depth of concern around this type of offence . "
the roofie organisation , which was set up to help victims of drug rape , says it has received around 6,000 calls from women and men since 1997 .
testing kits newspapers have carried campaigns about the subject and even offered free testing kits so that drinks can be monitored during a night out .
but mr gee warned : " to my knowledge , and having consulted the forensic science service on this , there is no single definitive test which can identify specific drugs in drinks or bodily fluids .
it is a far more complicated issue than many people realise .
" there are one or two products on the market which say that they can do this , but also in the small print say that they can not do this .
" i would n't like people to be buying these kits , using them in public places and feeling that they are safe , because that may not be the case . "
a campaign warning of the dangers of leaving drinks unattended was also recently launched by staffordshire police .
but while there have been proven cases of spiked drinks being used to subdue victims , no reliable figures have ever been released .
as a result , the latest research is expected to produce the first ever official statistics on the subject by next spring .
operation matise will begin in august or september , subject to approval from ethics watchdogs .

at & t said it intends to concentrate on serving business customers , though it would keep existing household accounts .
net profits dived to $ 108m -lrb- £ 56.8m -rrb- in the second quarter of 2004 , from $ 536m year-earlier , while revenue was 13 % lower at $ 7.6bn.
at & t has been squeezed by cable services in the household calls market .
beaten by bundling about 40 % of us households now buy bundled services , making it impossible for at & t to compete in its traditional market of long-distance domestic calls , said company chairman and chief executive dave dorman .
business customers provide 75 % of at & t 's revenue reaction to the firm 's new strategy was mixed , as its chosen sector , the business telecoms market , also suffers from intense pricing competition and tight margins .
business customers already provide three quarters of at & t 's sales .
however , credit ratings agency standard & poor 's said it was considering slashing its rating on the telecoms firm 's debt to junk status , while rival ratings agency fitch promptly did so .
but some analysts praised the move .
" we believe that dave dorman has found the correct eject cord to pull in order to save ma bell , " said greg gorbatenko , an analyst at marquis investment research .
glory days at & t 's history goes back to 1876 , when alexander graham bell patented the telephone .

at & t said second quarter revenue from business customers fell 13 % to $ 5.6bn , while sales to consumers were down 15 % to $ 2bn .
at & t is developing specialist business packages , including voice-activated internet services .
a ruling by the us telecoms regulator threatens to raise the costs for at & t of continuing to provide household phone services .
the federal communications commission said the fees charged by local operators for wholesale line rentals to long-distance providers would be permitted to rise 15 % if pricing negotiations fail to produce agreement by the end of the year .
