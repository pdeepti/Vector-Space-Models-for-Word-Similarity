the huge “ green week ” trade fair features nearly 1,600 exhibitors from 56 countries , all of them there to promote their own food and agricultural products . accompanying the schmoozing , buying and selling are conferences and talks on hot topics in the food industry .
of particular interest this year : genetically altered foods , the planned expansion of the eu , dealing with the bse crisis , and the health of germany ’ s youth . “ frankenfoods ” : not whether , but when bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , gerd sonnleitner in germany , the question is no longer whether to allow the cultivation of genetically altered foods cultivation , but how .
starting in april , genetically modified produce , and foodstuffs containing them , will need to be labelled as such across the european union . german consumer protection minister renate künast , who opened the fair on friday , supports legislation that would allow genetically modified and non-genetically modified foods to sit side by side on german supermarket shelves - labelled accordingly , of course . critics of the policy complain that künast has bent too far to accommodate agribusiness .
künast has denied the charge .
rather , she said , the new policy would give individual consumers the freedom to decide whether or not they want to buy genetically modified foods . a field is not a sweater “ they know for a fact that in the area of genetic technology we have a world wide cultivation area of 60 million hectares -lrb- 148 million acres -rrb- – and the tendency is toward growth , ” künast told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dried meats at green week “ there is the danger that genetic technology will creep into our agriculture , ” she added .
“ or there is the opportunity to establish rules . ” but felix prinz zu löwenstein , chairman of the organic growers ’ association , said he doubts that a law allowing the side-by-side practice of both genetically altered and non-genetically altered cultivation can function . " unfortunately , the simultaneous cultivation of genetically altered plants and non-genetically altered plants doesn ’ t work , ” löwenstein said .
“ it ’ s not like laying two different colored sweaters side by side .
through cross breeding of various types of plants and the mixture during food production , these two types of foods will come together . ” fear of flooding another key topic at the trade fair will likely be the integration of the 10 new eu member states into the inter-european agriculture market .
the countries , mostly from eastern europe , are set to join the eu on may 1 .
some of the states , such as poland , are agriculture heavyweights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows at green week gerd sonnleitner of the german farmers ’ association said that german farmers fear a sudden flooding of europe ’ s agriculture market . rather than worry , sonnleitner put a positive spin on the issue .
“ i see the eastward expansion of europe as more of an opportunity , ” he said .
“ poland , but also the czech republic and hungary have strong economic growth that will continue over many years .
that means per person income is growing , and with it the demand for high-quality foods . ” promoting good nutrition one of künast ’ s aims is to use green week as a platform for promoting better nutrition among german consumers . “ in actuality , every fifth child and teenager in germany is overweight , with the numbers on the rise , ” künast said .
“ that leaves children with a physical and psychological handicap .
it weighs heavily on the health care system as well . ” germany ’ s response to this problem ?
“ we started a campaign with the motto ‘ any child can do it : eat better , get more exercise , ’ ” künast said .
in addition , she said , the state is offering advice to schools that are planning to offer lunch programs , as part of a much-debated expansion of all-day schooling . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to greenlight gm food labeling carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops .

the huge “ green week ” trade fair features nearly 1,600 exhibitors from 56 countries , all of them there to promote their own food and agricultural products . accompanying the schmoozing , buying and selling are conferences and talks on hot topics in the food industry .
of particular interest this year : genetically altered foods , the planned expansion of the eu , dealing with the bse crisis , and the health of germany ’ s youth . “ frankenfoods ” : not whether , but when bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , gerd sonnleitner in germany , the question is no longer whether to allow the cultivation of genetically altered foods cultivation , but how .
starting in april , genetically modified produce , and foodstuffs containing them , will need to be labelled as such across the european union . german consumer protection minister renate künast , who opened the fair on friday , supports legislation that would allow genetically modified and non-genetically modified foods to sit side by side on german supermarket shelves - labelled accordingly , of course . critics of the policy complain that künast has bent too far to accommodate agribusiness .
künast has denied the charge .
rather , she said , the new policy would give individual consumers the freedom to decide whether or not they want to buy genetically modified foods . a field is not a sweater “ they know for a fact that in the area of genetic technology we have a world wide cultivation area of 60 million hectares -lrb- 148 million acres -rrb- – and the tendency is toward growth , ” künast told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dried meats at green week “ there is the danger that genetic technology will creep into our agriculture , ” she added .
“ or there is the opportunity to establish rules . ” but felix prinz zu löwenstein , chairman of the organic growers ’ association , said he doubts that a law allowing the side-by-side practice of both genetically altered and non-genetically altered cultivation can function . " unfortunately , the simultaneous cultivation of genetically altered plants and non-genetically altered plants doesn ’ t work , ” löwenstein said .
“ it ’ s not like laying two different colored sweaters side by side .
through cross breeding of various types of plants and the mixture during food production , these two types of foods will come together . ” fear of flooding another key topic at the trade fair will likely be the integration of the 10 new eu member states into the inter-european agriculture market .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .
schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .
the final stop on schröder ’ s trip is south africa , which still remains germany ’ s most-important partner on the african continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannesburg skyline south africa is important to us because " it is the strongest economic power that dominates and , at the same time , knows that it must help pull other states into the economic boom , " büttner said . that could come through development aid or greater economic integration , he added .
berlin is also prepared to help them in this regard .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .
schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .
the final stop on schröder ’ s trip is south africa , which still remains germany ’ s most-important partner on the african continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannesburg skyline south africa is important to us because " it is the strongest economic power that dominates and , at the same time , knows that it must help pull other states into the economic boom , " büttner said . that could come through development aid or greater economic integration , he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2004 opinion : saving germany 's universities with public service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would german students be willing to care for others to pay for college ?
germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2004 opinion : saving germany 's universities with public service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would german students be willing to care for others to pay for college ?
germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .
there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

on monday , a former sexual partner of the victim , bernd-jürgen brandes , testified that the dead man once offered 5,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- to have his penis bitten off .
however , another former lover said later in the week that brandes had never expressed a death wish or any desire for pain .
the conflicting statements are crucial to the prosecution of the 42-year old meiwes who , although he admitted to killing , carving up and eating brandes in march 2001 , denies committing murder .
meiwes maintains brandes wanted to consumed and that he requested his penis be cut off and eaten .
but the former lover said he and brandes , who had been a happy couple since 1999 , would never had made such a request . prosecutors acknowledge brandes appeared to have been an accomplice in his own death and consumption , all of which meiwes recorded on videotape , but they say the accused is still guilty of murder .
if convicted of murder , the cannibal faces life in prison , but only up to five years if he is sentenced to a lesser charge of " killing on demand . " dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts watching the complex case which many believe ould make legal history .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .
“ but i often hear , ‘ yes , i still get it , but i don ’ t really know why . ’
i don ’ t know who will read aufbau in the future , when we -lrb- immigrants from germany -rrb- are all gone .
certainly not my children .
and my grandchildren even less so . " trans-atlantic content aufbau ’ s new editorial leadership hopes it has found a way to address the readership problem , and to that end , recently overhauled the paper .
in 2001 , aufbau became part of a larger not-for-profit educational organization aimed at improving and examining jewish-german relations . under editor in chief lorenz wolffers , the editorial staff was enhanced , and in february 2002 , aufbau opened an office in berlin .
most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .
there 's also an editorial , either by an american or a german writer , published in both english and german .
the transatlantic page focuses on trends and perspectives by positioning side-by-side articles written by an american author in germany and a german author residing in the u.s. despite his concerns for the paper ’ s future , goldmann has nothing but praise for the new venture .
he also supports the point of view of the present aufbau staff , many of whom , he notes , are not jewish . new point of view " it is a point of view of people who remember the past , but don ’ t simply root around in the holocaust , ” he said .
“ second , it is a look at new york , often entertaining things , which really could be interesting for german readers .
especially young ones . " despite the changes , the new aufbau ’ s circulation barely rates a mention in germany , despite frequent praise in the german press .
in new york , the publisher is collecting money in an effort to put out the somewhat larger anniversary issue .
after that , workers at the paper say , the end could come as soon as february . overall , the mood is shaky for a paper hoping to celebrate its 70th anniversary . rainer sütfeld / ja send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links aufbau 's online edition .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi supermarket the success of trader joe ’ s isn ’ t the only albrecht success story in the united states .
aldi itself is a growing brand on the other side of the atlantic .
since opening its first store in 1976 , aldi has expanded its presence to 671 stores in 25 states .
according to a 2002 study by the agricultural marketing resource center at iowa state university , aldi ranked as the # 21 supermarket chain in the u.s. , with estimated revenues exceeding $ 3 billion annually . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bracing for the german discount store revolution german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .

the huge “ green week ” trade fair features nearly 1,600 exhibitors from 56 countries , all of them there to promote their own food and agricultural products . accompanying the schmoozing , buying and selling are conferences and talks on hot topics in the food industry .
of particular interest this year : genetically altered foods , the planned expansion of the eu , dealing with the bse crisis , and the health of germany ’ s youth . “ frankenfoods ” : not whether , but when bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , gerd sonnleitner in germany , the question is no longer whether to allow the cultivation of genetically altered foods cultivation , but how .
starting in april , genetically modified produce , and foodstuffs containing them , will need to be labelled as such across the european union . german consumer protection minister renate künast , who opened the fair on friday , supports legislation that would allow genetically modified and non-genetically modified foods to sit side by side on german supermarket shelves - labelled accordingly , of course . critics of the policy complain that künast has bent too far to accommodate agribusiness .
künast has denied the charge .
rather , she said , the new policy would give individual consumers the freedom to decide whether or not they want to buy genetically modified foods . a field is not a sweater “ they know for a fact that in the area of genetic technology we have a world wide cultivation area of 60 million hectares -lrb- 148 million acres -rrb- – and the tendency is toward growth , ” künast told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dried meats at green week “ there is the danger that genetic technology will creep into our agriculture , ” she added .
“ or there is the opportunity to establish rules . ” but felix prinz zu löwenstein , chairman of the organic growers ’ association , said he doubts that a law allowing the side-by-side practice of both genetically altered and non-genetically altered cultivation can function . " unfortunately , the simultaneous cultivation of genetically altered plants and non-genetically altered plants doesn ’ t work , ” löwenstein said .
“ it ’ s not like laying two different colored sweaters side by side .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .
schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .
the final stop on schröder ’ s trip is south africa , which still remains germany ’ s most-important partner on the african continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannesburg skyline south africa is important to us because " it is the strongest economic power that dominates and , at the same time , knows that it must help pull other states into the economic boom , " büttner said . that could come through development aid or greater economic integration , he added .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”

most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .

in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2004 opinion : saving germany 's universities with public service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would german students be willing to care for others to pay for college ?
germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .
there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .
-lrb- january 8 , 2004 -rrb- berlin students persevere in quirky protests german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .

there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .
“ but i often hear , ‘ yes , i still get it , but i don ’ t really know why . ’
i don ’ t know who will read aufbau in the future , when we -lrb- immigrants from germany -rrb- are all gone .
certainly not my children .
and my grandchildren even less so . " trans-atlantic content aufbau ’ s new editorial leadership hopes it has found a way to address the readership problem , and to that end , recently overhauled the paper .
in 2001 , aufbau became part of a larger not-for-profit educational organization aimed at improving and examining jewish-german relations . under editor in chief lorenz wolffers , the editorial staff was enhanced , and in february 2002 , aufbau opened an office in berlin .
most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .
there 's also an editorial , either by an american or a german writer , published in both english and german .
the transatlantic page focuses on trends and perspectives by positioning side-by-side articles written by an american author in germany and a german author residing in the u.s. despite his concerns for the paper ’ s future , goldmann has nothing but praise for the new venture .
he also supports the point of view of the present aufbau staff , many of whom , he notes , are not jewish . new point of view " it is a point of view of people who remember the past , but don ’ t simply root around in the holocaust , ” he said .
“ second , it is a look at new york , often entertaining things , which really could be interesting for german readers .
especially young ones . " despite the changes , the new aufbau ’ s circulation barely rates a mention in germany , despite frequent praise in the german press .
in new york , the publisher is collecting money in an effort to put out the somewhat larger anniversary issue .
after that , workers at the paper say , the end could come as soon as february . overall , the mood is shaky for a paper hoping to celebrate its 70th anniversary . rainer sütfeld / ja send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links aufbau 's online edition .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .

most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.01.2004 the american way of aldi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for many americans , trader joe 's has become a way of life , like california 's beaches .
a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi supermarket the success of trader joe ’ s isn ’ t the only albrecht success story in the united states .
aldi itself is a growing brand on the other side of the atlantic .
since opening its first store in 1976 , aldi has expanded its presence to 671 stores in 25 states .
according to a 2002 study by the agricultural marketing resource center at iowa state university , aldi ranked as the # 21 supermarket chain in the u.s. , with estimated revenues exceeding $ 3 billion annually . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bracing for the german discount store revolution german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery .
-lrb- june 10 , 2003 -rrb- a declaration of war against aldi ?
germany 's minister for consumer protection says discount supermarkets like aldi are guilty of price dumping that threatens jobs and german farms .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .

the huge “ green week ” trade fair features nearly 1,600 exhibitors from 56 countries , all of them there to promote their own food and agricultural products . accompanying the schmoozing , buying and selling are conferences and talks on hot topics in the food industry .
of particular interest this year : genetically altered foods , the planned expansion of the eu , dealing with the bse crisis , and the health of germany ’ s youth . “ frankenfoods ” : not whether , but when bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , gerd sonnleitner in germany , the question is no longer whether to allow the cultivation of genetically altered foods cultivation , but how .
starting in april , genetically modified produce , and foodstuffs containing them , will need to be labelled as such across the european union . german consumer protection minister renate künast , who opened the fair on friday , supports legislation that would allow genetically modified and non-genetically modified foods to sit side by side on german supermarket shelves - labelled accordingly , of course . critics of the policy complain that künast has bent too far to accommodate agribusiness .
künast has denied the charge .
rather , she said , the new policy would give individual consumers the freedom to decide whether or not they want to buy genetically modified foods . a field is not a sweater “ they know for a fact that in the area of genetic technology we have a world wide cultivation area of 60 million hectares -lrb- 148 million acres -rrb- – and the tendency is toward growth , ” künast told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dried meats at green week “ there is the danger that genetic technology will creep into our agriculture , ” she added .
“ or there is the opportunity to establish rules . ” but felix prinz zu löwenstein , chairman of the organic growers ’ association , said he doubts that a law allowing the side-by-side practice of both genetically altered and non-genetically altered cultivation can function . " unfortunately , the simultaneous cultivation of genetically altered plants and non-genetically altered plants doesn ’ t work , ” löwenstein said .
“ it ’ s not like laying two different colored sweaters side by side .
through cross breeding of various types of plants and the mixture during food production , these two types of foods will come together . ” fear of flooding another key topic at the trade fair will likely be the integration of the 10 new eu member states into the inter-european agriculture market .
the countries , mostly from eastern europe , are set to join the eu on may 1 .
some of the states , such as poland , are agriculture heavyweights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows at green week gerd sonnleitner of the german farmers ’ association said that german farmers fear a sudden flooding of europe ’ s agriculture market . rather than worry , sonnleitner put a positive spin on the issue .
“ i see the eastward expansion of europe as more of an opportunity , ” he said .
“ poland , but also the czech republic and hungary have strong economic growth that will continue over many years .
that means per person income is growing , and with it the demand for high-quality foods . ” promoting good nutrition one of künast ’ s aims is to use green week as a platform for promoting better nutrition among german consumers . “ in actuality , every fifth child and teenager in germany is overweight , with the numbers on the rise , ” künast said .
“ that leaves children with a physical and psychological handicap .
it weighs heavily on the health care system as well . ” germany ’ s response to this problem ?
“ we started a campaign with the motto ‘ any child can do it : eat better , get more exercise , ’ ” künast said .
in addition , she said , the state is offering advice to schools that are planning to offer lunch programs , as part of a much-debated expansion of all-day schooling . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to greenlight gm food labeling carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .
there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .
-lrb- january 8 , 2004 -rrb- berlin students persevere in quirky protests german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .

in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .
schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .
the final stop on schröder ’ s trip is south africa , which still remains germany ’ s most-important partner on the african continent .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .

the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .
“ but i often hear , ‘ yes , i still get it , but i don ’ t really know why . ’
i don ’ t know who will read aufbau in the future , when we -lrb- immigrants from germany -rrb- are all gone .
certainly not my children .
and my grandchildren even less so . " trans-atlantic content aufbau ’ s new editorial leadership hopes it has found a way to address the readership problem , and to that end , recently overhauled the paper .
in 2001 , aufbau became part of a larger not-for-profit educational organization aimed at improving and examining jewish-german relations . under editor in chief lorenz wolffers , the editorial staff was enhanced , and in february 2002 , aufbau opened an office in berlin .
most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .
there 's also an editorial , either by an american or a german writer , published in both english and german .
the transatlantic page focuses on trends and perspectives by positioning side-by-side articles written by an american author in germany and a german author residing in the u.s. despite his concerns for the paper ’ s future , goldmann has nothing but praise for the new venture .
he also supports the point of view of the present aufbau staff , many of whom , he notes , are not jewish . new point of view " it is a point of view of people who remember the past , but don ’ t simply root around in the holocaust , ” he said .
“ second , it is a look at new york , often entertaining things , which really could be interesting for german readers .
especially young ones . " despite the changes , the new aufbau ’ s circulation barely rates a mention in germany , despite frequent praise in the german press .
in new york , the publisher is collecting money in an effort to put out the somewhat larger anniversary issue .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.01.2004 schröder ’ s africa trip to highlight development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will return a visit by ghana 's president kufuor in 2002 during his first visit to africa next week , the german chancellor will emphasize recent successes , like the creation of the african union partnership and development programs aimed at helping the continent help itself . german chancellor gerhard schröder sets off on sunday for a week-long tour of africa that will take him to ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana .
schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .
schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .
the final stop on schröder ’ s trip is south africa , which still remains germany ’ s most-important partner on the african continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannesburg skyline south africa is important to us because " it is the strongest economic power that dominates and , at the same time , knows that it must help pull other states into the economic boom , " büttner said . that could come through development aid or greater economic integration , he added .
berlin is also prepared to help them in this regard .
twenty three executives are traveling with the chancellor to africa , most from medium-sized businesses that are interested in making investments in south africa .

on monday , a former sexual partner of the victim , bernd-jürgen brandes , testified that the dead man once offered 5,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- to have his penis bitten off .
however , another former lover said later in the week that brandes had never expressed a death wish or any desire for pain .
the conflicting statements are crucial to the prosecution of the 42-year old meiwes who , although he admitted to killing , carving up and eating brandes in march 2001 , denies committing murder .
meiwes maintains brandes wanted to consumed and that he requested his penis be cut off and eaten .
but the former lover said he and brandes , who had been a happy couple since 1999 , would never had made such a request . prosecutors acknowledge brandes appeared to have been an accomplice in his own death and consumption , all of which meiwes recorded on videotape , but they say the accused is still guilty of murder .
if convicted of murder , the cannibal faces life in prison , but only up to five years if he is sentenced to a lesser charge of " killing on demand .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi supermarket the success of trader joe ’ s isn ’ t the only albrecht success story in the united states .
aldi itself is a growing brand on the other side of the atlantic .
since opening its first store in 1976 , aldi has expanded its presence to 671 stores in 25 states .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi supermarket the success of trader joe ’ s isn ’ t the only albrecht success story in the united states .
aldi itself is a growing brand on the other side of the atlantic .
since opening its first store in 1976 , aldi has expanded its presence to 671 stores in 25 states .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .
“ but i often hear , ‘ yes , i still get it , but i don ’ t really know why . ’
i don ’ t know who will read aufbau in the future , when we -lrb- immigrants from germany -rrb- are all gone .
certainly not my children .
and my grandchildren even less so . " trans-atlantic content aufbau ’ s new editorial leadership hopes it has found a way to address the readership problem , and to that end , recently overhauled the paper .
in 2001 , aufbau became part of a larger not-for-profit educational organization aimed at improving and examining jewish-german relations . under editor in chief lorenz wolffers , the editorial staff was enhanced , and in february 2002 , aufbau opened an office in berlin .
most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .
there 's also an editorial , either by an american or a german writer , published in both english and german .
the transatlantic page focuses on trends and perspectives by positioning side-by-side articles written by an american author in germany and a german author residing in the u.s. despite his concerns for the paper ’ s future , goldmann has nothing but praise for the new venture .
he also supports the point of view of the present aufbau staff , many of whom , he notes , are not jewish . new point of view " it is a point of view of people who remember the past , but don ’ t simply root around in the holocaust , ” he said .
“ second , it is a look at new york , often entertaining things , which really could be interesting for german readers .
especially young ones . " despite the changes , the new aufbau ’ s circulation barely rates a mention in germany , despite frequent praise in the german press .
in new york , the publisher is collecting money in an effort to put out the somewhat larger anniversary issue .
after that , workers at the paper say , the end could come as soon as february . overall , the mood is shaky for a paper hoping to celebrate its 70th anniversary . rainer sütfeld / ja send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links aufbau 's online edition .

now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .

on monday , a former sexual partner of the victim , bernd-jürgen brandes , testified that the dead man once offered 5,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- to have his penis bitten off .
however , another former lover said later in the week that brandes had never expressed a death wish or any desire for pain .
the conflicting statements are crucial to the prosecution of the 42-year old meiwes who , although he admitted to killing , carving up and eating brandes in march 2001 , denies committing murder .
meiwes maintains brandes wanted to consumed and that he requested his penis be cut off and eaten .
but the former lover said he and brandes , who had been a happy couple since 1999 , would never had made such a request . prosecutors acknowledge brandes appeared to have been an accomplice in his own death and consumption , all of which meiwes recorded on videotape , but they say the accused is still guilty of murder .
if convicted of murder , the cannibal faces life in prison , but only up to five years if he is sentenced to a lesser charge of " killing on demand . " dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts watching the complex case which many believe ould make legal history .

on monday , a former sexual partner of the victim , bernd-jürgen brandes , testified that the dead man once offered 5,000 german marks -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- to have his penis bitten off .
however , another former lover said later in the week that brandes had never expressed a death wish or any desire for pain .
the conflicting statements are crucial to the prosecution of the 42-year old meiwes who , although he admitted to killing , carving up and eating brandes in march 2001 , denies committing murder .
meiwes maintains brandes wanted to consumed and that he requested his penis be cut off and eaten .
but the former lover said he and brandes , who had been a happy couple since 1999 , would never had made such a request . prosecutors acknowledge brandes appeared to have been an accomplice in his own death and consumption , all of which meiwes recorded on videotape , but they say the accused is still guilty of murder .
if convicted of murder , the cannibal faces life in prison , but only up to five years if he is sentenced to a lesser charge of " killing on demand . " dw-world.de german cannibal trial opens in complexity the trial of armin meiwes , who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel with experts watching the complex case which many believe ould make legal history .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .
schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .
there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .
-lrb- january 8 , 2004 -rrb- berlin students persevere in quirky protests german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .
there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.01.2004 schröder ’ s africa trip to highlight development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder will return a visit by ghana 's president kufuor in 2002 during his first visit to africa next week , the german chancellor will emphasize recent successes , like the creation of the african union partnership and development programs aimed at helping the continent help itself . german chancellor gerhard schröder sets off on sunday for a week-long tour of africa that will take him to ethiopia , kenya , south africa and ghana .
schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .

the huge “ green week ” trade fair features nearly 1,600 exhibitors from 56 countries , all of them there to promote their own food and agricultural products . accompanying the schmoozing , buying and selling are conferences and talks on hot topics in the food industry .
of particular interest this year : genetically altered foods , the planned expansion of the eu , dealing with the bse crisis , and the health of germany ’ s youth . “ frankenfoods ” : not whether , but when bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , gerd sonnleitner in germany , the question is no longer whether to allow the cultivation of genetically altered foods cultivation , but how .
starting in april , genetically modified produce , and foodstuffs containing them , will need to be labelled as such across the european union . german consumer protection minister renate künast , who opened the fair on friday , supports legislation that would allow genetically modified and non-genetically modified foods to sit side by side on german supermarket shelves - labelled accordingly , of course . critics of the policy complain that künast has bent too far to accommodate agribusiness .
künast has denied the charge .
rather , she said , the new policy would give individual consumers the freedom to decide whether or not they want to buy genetically modified foods . a field is not a sweater “ they know for a fact that in the area of genetic technology we have a world wide cultivation area of 60 million hectares -lrb- 148 million acres -rrb- – and the tendency is toward growth , ” künast told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dried meats at green week “ there is the danger that genetic technology will creep into our agriculture , ” she added .
“ or there is the opportunity to establish rules . ” but felix prinz zu löwenstein , chairman of the organic growers ’ association , said he doubts that a law allowing the side-by-side practice of both genetically altered and non-genetically altered cultivation can function . " unfortunately , the simultaneous cultivation of genetically altered plants and non-genetically altered plants doesn ’ t work , ” löwenstein said .
“ it ’ s not like laying two different colored sweaters side by side .
through cross breeding of various types of plants and the mixture during food production , these two types of foods will come together . ” fear of flooding another key topic at the trade fair will likely be the integration of the 10 new eu member states into the inter-european agriculture market .
the countries , mostly from eastern europe , are set to join the eu on may 1 .
some of the states , such as poland , are agriculture heavyweights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cows at green week gerd sonnleitner of the german farmers ’ association said that german farmers fear a sudden flooding of europe ’ s agriculture market . rather than worry , sonnleitner put a positive spin on the issue .
“ i see the eastward expansion of europe as more of an opportunity , ” he said .
“ poland , but also the czech republic and hungary have strong economic growth that will continue over many years .
that means per person income is growing , and with it the demand for high-quality foods . ” promoting good nutrition one of künast ’ s aims is to use green week as a platform for promoting better nutrition among german consumers . “ in actuality , every fifth child and teenager in germany is overweight , with the numbers on the rise , ” künast said .
“ that leaves children with a physical and psychological handicap .
it weighs heavily on the health care system as well . ” germany ’ s response to this problem ?
“ we started a campaign with the motto ‘ any child can do it : eat better , get more exercise , ’ ” künast said .
in addition , she said , the state is offering advice to schools that are planning to offer lunch programs , as part of a much-debated expansion of all-day schooling . dw staff -lrb- ja -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to greenlight gm food labeling carrying out a european union directive , germany 's governing coalition of social democrats and greens has reached an agreement on how to regulate genetically modified crops .

however , german domestic politics also played a role .
it is a difficult period just now as controversial health care reform has just been pushed through in the country meaning that its citizens have to contribute more to the state coffers for their healthcare - it is unlikely that they would take kindly to a hike in meps ' salaries .
more generally , concern has been expressed about where the european parliament will get the between € 80-100 million extra from the eu budget .
berlin is not convinced that it will be able to find the money .
at the moment , meps get a salary in line with those of their national counterparts .
this means that while italians meps get around € 12,000 a month , their spanish counterparts have to make do with about € 2,500 a month - colleagues from the new member states , meanwhile , get on average € 800 a month .
the whole matter will now be passed on to a meeting of eu foreign ministers on 26 january to if it can be resolved there .

a german diplomat told the euobserver that berlin opposed the plans because setting the salary at such a high level " would be impossible to communicate in a positive way to people .
we want to encourage people to participate in the -lsb- european -rsb- elections and at these times meps ' salaries are always mentioned , " continued the diplomat .
however , german domestic politics also played a role .
it is a difficult period just now as controversial health care reform has just been pushed through in the country meaning that its citizens have to contribute more to the state coffers for their healthcare - it is unlikely that they would take kindly to a hike in meps ' salaries .
more generally , concern has been expressed about where the european parliament will get the between € 80-100 million extra from the eu budget .
berlin is not convinced that it will be able to find the money .
at the moment , meps get a salary in line with those of their national counterparts .
this means that while italians meps get around € 12,000 a month , their spanish counterparts have to make do with about € 2,500 a month - colleagues from the new member states , meanwhile , get on average € 800 a month .
the whole matter will now be passed on to a meeting of eu foreign ministers on 26 january to if it can be resolved there .
if the issue is not resolved before the june european parliament elections , meps are likely to get an extremely hard time from their respective electorates as they try and convince them they are not part of the ' brussels gravy train ' .

macedonia 's application will come almost a year after croatia applied for eu membership .
that country is now on the verge of receiving the commission 's verdict , which is likely to be positive .
the commission is likely to take at least as long with macedonia 's application , but given the presence of eu peacekeeping troops in the country until december 2004 , it may well take much longer .
last summer a series of bomb attacks and kidnappings rocked the former yugoslav republic , calling into question the fragile peace which has emerged from ethnic tension in 2001 .
mr trajkovski 's government has long believed that the eu membership offers the most promising way to achieve lasting stability .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi supermarket the success of trader joe ’ s isn ’ t the only albrecht success story in the united states .
aldi itself is a growing brand on the other side of the atlantic .
since opening its first store in 1976 , aldi has expanded its presence to 671 stores in 25 states .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi supermarket the success of trader joe ’ s isn ’ t the only albrecht success story in the united states .
aldi itself is a growing brand on the other side of the atlantic .
since opening its first store in 1976 , aldi has expanded its presence to 671 stores in 25 states .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .
“ but i often hear , ‘ yes , i still get it , but i don ’ t really know why . ’
i don ’ t know who will read aufbau in the future , when we -lrb- immigrants from germany -rrb- are all gone .
certainly not my children .
and my grandchildren even less so . " trans-atlantic content aufbau ’ s new editorial leadership hopes it has found a way to address the readership problem , and to that end , recently overhauled the paper .
in 2001 , aufbau became part of a larger not-for-profit educational organization aimed at improving and examining jewish-german relations . under editor in chief lorenz wolffers , the editorial staff was enhanced , and in february 2002 , aufbau opened an office in berlin .
most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .
there 's also an editorial , either by an american or a german writer , published in both english and german .
the transatlantic page focuses on trends and perspectives by positioning side-by-side articles written by an american author in germany and a german author residing in the u.s. despite his concerns for the paper ’ s future , goldmann has nothing but praise for the new venture .
he also supports the point of view of the present aufbau staff , many of whom , he notes , are not jewish . new point of view " it is a point of view of people who remember the past , but don ’ t simply root around in the holocaust , ” he said .
“ second , it is a look at new york , often entertaining things , which really could be interesting for german readers .
especially young ones . " despite the changes , the new aufbau ’ s circulation barely rates a mention in germany , despite frequent praise in the german press .
in new york , the publisher is collecting money in an effort to put out the somewhat larger anniversary issue .
after that , workers at the paper say , the end could come as soon as february . overall , the mood is shaky for a paper hoping to celebrate its 70th anniversary . rainer sütfeld / ja send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links aufbau 's online edition . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .
“ but i often hear , ‘ yes , i still get it , but i don ’ t really know why . ’
i don ’ t know who will read aufbau in the future , when we -lrb- immigrants from germany -rrb- are all gone .
certainly not my children .
and my grandchildren even less so . " trans-atlantic content aufbau ’ s new editorial leadership hopes it has found a way to address the readership problem , and to that end , recently overhauled the paper .
in 2001 , aufbau became part of a larger not-for-profit educational organization aimed at improving and examining jewish-german relations . under editor in chief lorenz wolffers , the editorial staff was enhanced , and in february 2002 , aufbau opened an office in berlin .
most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .
there 's also an editorial , either by an american or a german writer , published in both english and german .
the transatlantic page focuses on trends and perspectives by positioning side-by-side articles written by an american author in germany and a german author residing in the u.s. despite his concerns for the paper ’ s future , goldmann has nothing but praise for the new venture .
he also supports the point of view of the present aufbau staff , many of whom , he notes , are not jewish . new point of view " it is a point of view of people who remember the past , but don ’ t simply root around in the holocaust , ” he said .
“ second , it is a look at new york , often entertaining things , which really could be interesting for german readers .
especially young ones . " despite the changes , the new aufbau ’ s circulation barely rates a mention in germany , despite frequent praise in the german press .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .
there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .
-lrb- january 8 , 2004 -rrb- berlin students persevere in quirky protests german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest .

opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .
there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .
schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .
the final stop on schröder ’ s trip is south africa , which still remains germany ’ s most-important partner on the african continent .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .
schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .
the final stop on schröder ’ s trip is south africa , which still remains germany ’ s most-important partner on the african continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannesburg skyline south africa is important to us because " it is the strongest economic power that dominates and , at the same time , knows that it must help pull other states into the economic boom , " büttner said . that could come through development aid or greater economic integration , he added .
berlin is also prepared to help them in this regard .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .
“ but i often hear , ‘ yes , i still get it , but i don ’ t really know why . ’
i don ’ t know who will read aufbau in the future , when we -lrb- immigrants from germany -rrb- are all gone .

and my grandchildren even less so . " trans-atlantic content aufbau ’ s new editorial leadership hopes it has found a way to address the readership problem , and to that end , recently overhauled the paper .
in 2001 , aufbau became part of a larger not-for-profit educational organization aimed at improving and examining jewish-german relations . under editor in chief lorenz wolffers , the editorial staff was enhanced , and in february 2002 , aufbau opened an office in berlin .
most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .
there 's also an editorial , either by an american or a german writer , published in both english and german .
the transatlantic page focuses on trends and perspectives by positioning side-by-side articles written by an american author in germany and a german author residing in the u.s. despite his concerns for the paper ’ s future , goldmann has nothing but praise for the new venture .
he also supports the point of view of the present aufbau staff , many of whom , he notes , are not jewish . new point of view " it is a point of view of people who remember the past , but don ’ t simply root around in the holocaust , ” he said .
“ second , it is a look at new york , often entertaining things , which really could be interesting for german readers .
especially young ones . " despite the changes , the new aufbau ’ s circulation barely rates a mention in germany , despite frequent praise in the german press .
in new york , the publisher is collecting money in an effort to put out the somewhat larger anniversary issue .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .
“ but i often hear , ‘ yes , i still get it , but i don ’ t really know why . ’
i don ’ t know who will read aufbau in the future , when we -lrb- immigrants from germany -rrb- are all gone .
certainly not my children .
and my grandchildren even less so . " trans-atlantic content aufbau ’ s new editorial leadership hopes it has found a way to address the readership problem , and to that end , recently overhauled the paper .
in 2001 , aufbau became part of a larger not-for-profit educational organization aimed at improving and examining jewish-german relations . under editor in chief lorenz wolffers , the editorial staff was enhanced , and in february 2002 , aufbau opened an office in berlin .
most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .
there 's also an editorial , either by an american or a german writer , published in both english and german .
the transatlantic page focuses on trends and perspectives by positioning side-by-side articles written by an american author in germany and a german author residing in the u.s. despite his concerns for the paper ’ s future , goldmann has nothing but praise for the new venture .
he also supports the point of view of the present aufbau staff , many of whom , he notes , are not jewish . new point of view " it is a point of view of people who remember the past , but don ’ t simply root around in the holocaust , ” he said .
“ second , it is a look at new york , often entertaining things , which really could be interesting for german readers .
especially young ones . " despite the changes , the new aufbau ’ s circulation barely rates a mention in germany , despite frequent praise in the german press .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2004 opinion : saving germany 's universities with public service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would german students be willing to care for others to pay for college ?
germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .

germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .
there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .
-lrb- january 8 , 2004 -rrb- berlin students persevere in quirky protests german students have always been quick to act when education funds are threatened , but news that the berlin government plans to cut university budgets by € 75 million has sparked unusual and creative forms of protest .

schröder won ’ t be packing an entirely new africa policy in his suitcase , but the chancellor and his delegation are poised to improve development cooperation , business ties and establish closer links with african leaders in the fight against international terrorism .
the unofficial motto of the trip is to help african nations so that they can better help themselves .
“ we ’ ve moved away from bilateral support – a drop here and a drop there , ” said hans büttner , the government 's spokesman for africa policy .
“ when you take a look at the results , you can see that we weren ’ t very successful .
we ’ re now supporting initiatives that say , ‘ we africans have to take charge of more ourselves . ’ ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : refugees after a volcano eruption in congo .
most germans tend to view africa predominantly as a continent of never-ending conflicts , civil wars and corruption .
this perception is not alien to politicians either .
schröder ’ s tour is designed to signal to leaders there that the german government does take note of the more positive developments on the continent in recent years .
recent successes among the leading examples of african progress is the new partnership for african development -lrb- nepad -rrb- , an initiative launched in 2001 by a number of african nations with the goal of creating an africa capable of containing simmering conflicts and crises before they boil over into war .
nepad also provides support for the creation of democratic structures in troubled areas .
a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .
the itinerary the second stop on schröder ’ s trip is kenya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mount kilimanjaro " kenya is the anchor of stability in east africa – both in its function as the region ’ s economic center and as the center of the security architecture in east africa as well in its role as active negotiating partner in helping to solve the problems in somalia , sudan and , partially , in the congo , " büttner said .
in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .
christening the annan center ghana is also an important partner for the german government in security issues .
schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .
the final stop on schröder ’ s trip is south africa , which still remains germany ’ s most-important partner on the african continent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannesburg skyline south africa is important to us because " it is the strongest economic power that dominates and , at the same time , knows that it must help pull other states into the economic boom , " büttner said . that could come through development aid or greater economic integration , he added .
berlin is also prepared to help them in this regard .

a second example of africa ’ s increasing self-reliance is the african union , or au , which , at least in principle , is comparable to the european union .
au ’ s headquarters is located in addis ababa , the capital of ethiopia .
this is one of the reasons that schröder will be giving a major african policy speech in that city .
government officials told deutsche welle that schröder is expected to pledge strong support for those countries in africa that show commitment to their own development .

in kenya , schröder is expected to offer german security experts to help train local police .
he is also expected to reach agreement for closer cooperation between the german and kenyan intelligence agencies in the fight against terrorism .
" we shouldn ’ t create any panic here , but it ’ s still the case that when ungoverned areas exist in africa , and they do exist right now , then there are also possible areas for international terrorists to retreat to , " said andreas mehler , director of the institute of african affairs in hamburg .
" we shouldn ’ t ignore this problem because someday it will come back to us . "
government sources told deutsche welle schröder is to announce a doubling of germany ’ s development aid for kenya over the next two years .

schröder will be visiting the capital city of accra to meet with president john agyekum kufuor and attend the opening of the kofi annan peacekeeping center .
at the center , named for the secretary general of the united nations , african peacekeepers will be trained with western aid for later deployment to crisis regions .

many people from all parts of the world took part in the charity drive .
the response from deutsche welle ’ s viewers , listeners and internet users has been overwhelming .
here are just a few examples : students at the albert schwiezer secondary school in cologne collected more than € 19,000 in donations for constructions of classrooms in afghanistan .

the schools were built in novobad , jamchi , yanqiqala , laclacond , sardcomar and in the baharak – all within a three-month period .
each classroom is approximately 40 square meters and can accommodate 30 to 40 students .

a u.s. business magazine telling americans to “ buy german ? ”
this strange but true forbes headline recently highlighted one of the biggest german success stories in america : trader joe ’ s . europeans have long been fans of the no-frills discount bins at aldi supermarket stores , which offer everything from champagne to cut flowers at prices often steeply discounted from those of competitors .
but few here are familiar with trader joe ’ s , aldi ’ s upmarket american discount chain , which has seen incredible growth in recent decades .
since 1977 , the company has been owned by theo albrecht , the billionaire behind the aldi nord supermarket chain .
trader joe ’ s has more than 200 stores across the u.s. and rings up an estimated $ 2.1 billion in annual revenues .
strike brings boom the company ’ s fortunes climbed even further this winter , as 75,000 grocery clerks in southern california abandoned their cash registers after the state ’ s largest supermarkets , including albertson ’ s , kroger and safeway , sought to reduce their health insurance and pensions .
uneager to cross the picket lines , many consumers poured into their local trader joe ’ s instead .
a non-union company , trader joe ’ s pays its employees an average of $ 21 per hour compared to the $ 17.90 paid by the union shops .
the company also offers employees health insurance and retirement benefits .
its generous labor practices and environmentally-conscious products offer customers just the mix it needed to make the jump from larger grocery stores to a smaller shop with a more refined selection .
though the company - owned by the famously reclusive theo albrecht , who with his brother is estimated to be worth $ 26.5 billion - is mum when it comes to discussing finances , forbes recently estimated that trader joe ’ s 74 stores in california have experienced a jump in revenues of 30 percent since the strike began .
worldly pleasures as other cashiers have taken to the picket lines , trader joe ’ s workers have continued ringing up dried fruits , european cheeses , meats and vegetables in their trademark hawaiian shirts - a symbol of the company 's casual and laid back style .
but the cashiers and products aren ’ t the only thing that differentiate trader joe ’ s from the competition .
like aldi , more than 80 percent of the products sold at trader joe ’ s are produced by other companies but sold under the trader joe label .
the company sells its wares under the trader giotto , trader jose , trader ming and trader jacques brands among others , representing the store ’ s hefty international lineup of goods .
trader joe ’ s also partners with wineries to bring high-quality but low-cost wines to its outlets , like charles shaw , otherwise known as " two buck chuck , " which has taken america by storm .
between 20-25 percent of trader joe ’ s products are imported from overseas .
a different kind of customer the nautically themed stores , where managers are called captains , also attract a different kind of customer than the average supermarket .
the german newsweekly der spiegel recently described them as " yoga-crazed , bush opponents or ballerinas . "
others have described it as one-stop shopping for " bourgeois bohemians , " the socially conscious , well-educated middle class with income to spare .
the fact that the company steers clear of more controversial foods , like duck , whose breeders animal rights activists accuse of animal abuse , also makes it an obvious choice for more socially conscientious customers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi supermarket the success of trader joe ’ s isn ’ t the only albrecht success story in the united states .
aldi itself is a growing brand on the other side of the atlantic .
since opening its first store in 1976 , aldi has expanded its presence to 671 stores in 25 states .

but some people close to the paper are wondering : how long will it last ? at first , the german language newspaper aufbau was supposed to publish a big 70th anniversary issue in january .
now , the date has been pushed back to late february - if it gets printed at all . seven decades ago , however , aufbau was the first source of information for people who fled nazi germany for new york .
it was printed in german and aimed at people like robert goldmann , who emigrated with his family to the united states just before the war . “ my parents read it , and for them it was the one important news source - about america , about the developments in the new german jewish immigration , and so on , ” goldmann told germany ’ s wdr radio . newsletter to newspaper in 1934 , aufbau ’ s readership was almost exclusively exiled immigrants who used the paper for its service pieces .
originating as a 12-page newsletter for the german-jewish club , it was full of advice , help and support for the new arrivals .
there were job advertisements and tips on how to adjust to life in america . two years later the paper started publishing news and other information , for those who couldn ’ t , or didn ’ t want to , “ read all about it ” in english language newspapers . circulation surged to 15,000 around the time the united states joined the anti-hitler coalition , and going into the 1960s , the paper - whose masthead had included names like albert einstein , thomas mann and hannah arendt - had a circulation of 300,000 . reporting the holocaust the aufbau also earned its stripes as an important source of news about the war .
it was the first newspaper to report on the genocide in german gas chambers , in july 1942 .
it was the holocaust black on white , reported with such detail that the reprinted deportation lists were used as evidence in the nuremberg trials . after the war , the paper helped those trying to relocate family and friends by running notices in its “ searching for ” and “ saved ” columns .
the paper still runs these columns today , and the latest issue has three entries in the “ searching for ” rubric . despite the three advertisements , however , the paper ’ s mandate is becoming ever less clear . “ there are older people like myself , who still read aufbau , just because we always have , ” goldmann says .
“ but i often hear , ‘ yes , i still get it , but i don ’ t really know why . ’
i don ’ t know who will read aufbau in the future , when we -lrb- immigrants from germany -rrb- are all gone .
certainly not my children .
and my grandchildren even less so . " trans-atlantic content aufbau ’ s new editorial leadership hopes it has found a way to address the readership problem , and to that end , recently overhauled the paper .
in 2001 , aufbau became part of a larger not-for-profit educational organization aimed at improving and examining jewish-german relations . under editor in chief lorenz wolffers , the editorial staff was enhanced , and in february 2002 , aufbau opened an office in berlin .
most important , the paper was relaunched in may , 2002 , and updated to embrace post-war generations in the u.s. , europe and israel .
the newspaper is now half in english , half in german , and has five categories of articles : politics , jewish life , jewish history , culture and , of course , german-jewish heritage . each issue of the newly revamped aufbau features a focus subject on which several articles are written , with a transatlantic angle , reflecting the range of views and how they differ between continents .
there 's also an editorial , either by an american or a german writer , published in both english and german .
the transatlantic page focuses on trends and perspectives by positioning side-by-side articles written by an american author in germany and a german author residing in the u.s. despite his concerns for the paper ’ s future , goldmann has nothing but praise for the new venture .
he also supports the point of view of the present aufbau staff , many of whom , he notes , are not jewish . new point of view " it is a point of view of people who remember the past , but don ’ t simply root around in the holocaust , ” he said .
“ second , it is a look at new york , often entertaining things , which really could be interesting for german readers .
especially young ones . " despite the changes , the new aufbau ’ s circulation barely rates a mention in germany , despite frequent praise in the german press .
in new york , the publisher is collecting money in an effort to put out the somewhat larger anniversary issue .
after that , workers at the paper say , the end could come as soon as february . overall , the mood is shaky for a paper hoping to celebrate its 70th anniversary . rainer sütfeld / ja send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links externer link : aufbau 's online edition . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour picture of the day dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw-world : dw screensaver dw-world : social bookmarking dw-world : our rss feeds dw-world : dw widgets dw-world : integrated search externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : dw on facebook externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : newsletters externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : netvibes.com the way you want it dw-world : mobile optimized for pdas externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : newsletters news in your inbox externer link , ã  â ¶ ffnet in neuem fenster : audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.01.2004 opinion : saving germany 's universities with public service großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would german students be willing to care for others to pay for college ?
germany ’ s universities are overcrowded , underfunded and mediocre at best .
opposition to charging students tuition has been strong , but an optional public service program could provide a socially-oriented solution . if there ’ s anyone who hasn ’ t heard yet , germany is in the midst of a crisis .
although the country still affords most of its citizens a high standard of living , many of the societal structures and institutions that served the world ’ s third largest economy so well for the last 50 years are either completely outdated or in need of serious overhaul . chancellor gerhard schröder has begun to tackle the bloated welfare state and rigid labor market with his so-called “ agenda 2010 ” package .
but just as parliament passed one batch of painful reforms late last year , the simmering problem of germany ’ s ailing university system boiled over . thousands of students nationwide have taken to the streets to protest massive budget cuts at a time when university buildings continue to crumble from neglect , students are forced to crowd into oversubscribed seminars and professors are fleeing to better-funded institutions abroad .
despite the cash crunch , an obvious solution of introducing tuition fees has met stiff resistance from both students and politicians . as if having to deal with a mediocre educational system weren ’ t enough for the government , a debate has also sprung up regarding the future of compulsory military service known as wehrdienst and its civilian counterpart , zivildienst . as germany takes a more active approach towards foreign policy such as its peacekeeping missions in afghanistan and in the balkans , calls are growing for the country to move to a all-professional military .
however , eliminating military service for german men would also spell an end to the thousands of social jobs done by those choosing to avoid a stint in the army .
organizations that care for the elderly or disabled are already warning many services could be cut or costs could rise without zivildienst participants . an elegant solution on thursday , family minister renate schmidt accepted a government commission ’ s proposal for modernizing zivildienst .
with no competency for dealing with the country ’ s education woes , however , the report “ impulses for the civil society ” overlooks a potentially elegant solution to both issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's health care and social service sectors heavily rely on young men doing their zivildienst .
why not set up a zivildienst system where students that either couldn ’ t afford college tuition fees or those who wished not to pay them were instead allowed to work social jobs to finance their education ? this would both have the salutary effect of bringing more money into the beleaguered german university system via modest fees , while simultaneously encouraging thousands of young men and women to take part in worthy public service . solidarity is a popular word in germany and it is tossed around frequently by many of those protesting cuts at the universities .
many of the students argue , and rightly so , that it is society ’ s obligation to provide a decent education .
however , the society ’ s elites – which the university educated are – also have an obligation to take care of those less fortunate and those in need .
few currently on the barricades could argue with that . looking only at the city of berlin , the numbers speak for themselves : the city presently only has around 3,000 men taking part in social service in lieu of military conscription .
with a student population far in excess of 100,000 , berlin would easily find enough men and women willing to either take a year off for zivildienst , or to work social jobs part-time during their studies . tuition fees unavoidable no one in germany wants to see the development of a higher education system like that in the united states , where a college education can cost tens of thousand of dollars each year .
therefore many , like german education minister edelgard bulmahn , argue against tuition fees of any size .
that may be admirable , however , it ’ s a position that is likely untenable . in a recent interview with dw-tv , bulmahn said tuition fees in america meant higher education there is only for the rich .
that highly selective view , however , is flat out wrong .
though no one could argue a degree from a u.s. university comes cheap , most students receive financial aid and grants . then there are programs like the g.i. bill where in exchange for a few years in the armed forces , students can earn thousands of dollars for college .
a similar program for national and community service called americorps also exists .
there is no conceivable reason why germany ’ s legions of pencil-wielding bureaucrats can ’ t come up with a comparable system for zivildienst . on friday , the former premier of the german state of lower saxony , sigmar gabriel , suggested in the tagesspiegel newspaper that there could be “ education vouchers ” to encourage more people to volunteer for social service .
that is heading in the right direction , but it doesn ’ t go nearly far enough . a zivildienst for higher education would not only help halt the decline of the country ’ s universities , it would also strengthen the noble tradition of solidarity in german society . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”
but many are already in dire straits , a far cry from the country ’ s legendary academic yore .

it is hoped that as many as 2,000 operations will be carried out in the first 12 months at dolan park hospital at tardebigge , near bromsgrove , worcestershire .
the hospital was to originally be built as a conventional private clinic , but was redesigned after gastric surgeon phil thomas persuaded its owners of the need for a specialist obesity unit .
dolan park hopes to win nhs contracts as it is estimated that mainstream hospitals are only performing one-tenth of the obesity surgery that is needed .
' radical approach ' the clinic has been redesigned with four operating theatres and an intensive care unit .
mr thomas , who is a consultant surgeon , said " for many reasons , some of which are to do with funding , only 200 cases were undertaken in the whole of the uk last year .
" it should be nearer 4,000 at least - probably nearer 10,000 . "
he added : " we need to take a radical approach to -lrb- obesity -rrb- otherwise we 're going to be having millions of our citizens dying prematurely , having lived a life of chronic debilitation . "
some of the surgical procedures on offer will include putting a band around the stomach to make it smaller .
that is likely to cost about £ 7,000 .
another treatment will involve putting a balloon inside the stomach , at a cost of about £ 3,500 david allinson , a manager for the national centre for obesity surgery , the company running the hospital , said : " looking at the way that healthcare was going on a national basis , we simply recognised that there was a need in the uk to deliver a comprehensive healthcare package to people suffering from obesity .

it is hoped that as many as 2,000 operations will be carried out in the first 12 months at dolan park hospital at tardebigge , near bromsgrove , worcestershire .
the hospital was to originally be built as a conventional private clinic , but was redesigned after gastric surgeon phil thomas persuaded its owners of the need for a specialist obesity unit .
dolan park hopes to win nhs contracts as it is estimated that mainstream hospitals are only performing one-tenth of the obesity surgery that is needed .
' radical approach ' the clinic has been redesigned with four operating theatres and an intensive care unit .
mr thomas , who is a consultant surgeon , said " for many reasons , some of which are to do with funding , only 200 cases were undertaken in the whole of the uk last year .
" it should be nearer 4,000 at least - probably nearer 10,000 . "
he added : " we need to take a radical approach to -lrb- obesity -rrb- otherwise we 're going to be having millions of our citizens dying prematurely , having lived a life of chronic debilitation . "
some of the surgical procedures on offer will include putting a band around the stomach to make it smaller .
that is likely to cost about £ 7,000 .
another treatment will involve putting a balloon inside the stomach , at a cost of about £ 3,500 david allinson , a manager for the national centre for obesity surgery , the company running the hospital , said : " looking at the way that healthcare was going on a national basis , we simply recognised that there was a need in the uk to deliver a comprehensive healthcare package to people suffering from obesity . "
dolan park is scheduled to open in march .

that is the view of accountancy firm grant thornton which has studied the books of eight of the biggest clubs .
the organisation 's cardiff office has completed a study of the reports and accounts filed at companies house by eight of the teams which used to make up the old premier league - and who now compete in a semi-professional league .
the teams looked at were cardiff , swansea , llanelli , neath , pontypridd , newport , bridgend , and caerphilly .
no accounts have so far been filed by caerphilly rugby football club limited , which did not incorporate until march 2002 .
the survey found that the clubs shared combined losses from 2002 amounting to nearly £ 4m and there is £ 6m owing from 2001 .
furthermore , the introduction of regional rugby meant that potential income sources like television rights , advertising , and cup matches had been closed off .
pontypridd rfc entered administration last year with debts of £ 670,000 the accountancy firm is advising club directors to seek urgent financial advice but is warning them against going into administration .
according to grant thornton 's specialist financial services partner , richard hawes , the results will make difficult reading for clubs and fans alike .
he warns that while the national team 's fortunes on the pitch appear to be improving after an encouraging world cup performance in australia , the financial situation facing wales ' leading premier league rugby clubs is decidedly less optimistic .
among the findings of the investigation were : the eight clubs reviewed had combined losses -lrb- excluding write-off of loans -rrb- of some £ 3.8m in relation to accounts filed for the year ending 2002 , and £ 6m in relation to accounts filed for the year ending 2001 ; the creation of the new regional tier has removed much of the earning potential in the way of gate receipts available to the premier league club companies whose places in the lucrative celtic cup , celtic league and heineken cup competitions have been taken by the regional entities ; reduced income has left the companies with little chance of ever being able to recover their historic accumulated losses ; grant thornton has advised that many directors of the premier league clubs involved should be seeking urgent financial advice to ensure they are acting within their responsibilities under the companies and insolvency acts .
the firm said typical creditors in a situation like this would be the inland revenue , hm customs & excise , breweries , as well as individuals who had given loans to the club .
financial future employees and suppliers also quite often found themselves in the position of being creditors , it said .
the accountants are warning directors of clubs not to pursue the administration route taken by pontypridd rugby football club ltd and swansea rugby football club ltd in the last two seasons , without first seeking appropriate professional advice .
many of the clubs concerned have sizeable assets and still enjoy income streams which can provide them with a means to run a business , the accountants said .
what was crucial , they added , was that the clubs ran their businesses within their means .
whilst the analysis highlights the financial problems associated with the premiership game , grant thornton believes that the club rugby structure in wales offers the prospect of a much-improved financial future for the game in wales overall .
earlier this season richard hawes and david thomas , both of grant thornton , were appointed to run pontypridd rugby football club ltd after its directors were forced to place the financially-troubled sardis road club into administration .

romany gypsies are the largest ethnic minority group in the county and throughout the summer months the exhibition - housed in a traditional travellers ' wagon - has been detailing their contribution to the area 's agricultural industry and culture .
it was developed by pembrokeshire museums service with the help of pupils at priory junior school in monkton after they found there was little information about gypsies at their local museum .
now the project has made it to a shortlist of 13 for the gulbenkian prize for museum of the year .
the exhibition inspired the older children to want to experience life on the road in a varda for themselves teacher beverly stephens the judging panel , chaired by lloyd grossman , will visit each candidate and whittle the entrants down to four .
the winner will be announced on 11 may at the royal academy , burlington gardens , during museums and galleries month .
beverly stephens , specialist teacher at monkton school , said : " the project has involved the whole community .
" grandparents brought their grandchildren to see the wagon and talk about their memories of life on the road , it helped that there were things to see inside as well as seeing it travel between the sites .
" the exhibition inspired the older children to want to experience life on the road in a varda for themselves .
beverly stephens inside the travellers ' wagon " relatives and friends have come from outside pembrokeshire to see the exhibition , and the community has taken pride in the varda being their exhibition . "
other entrants range from a crowd-pulling national blockbuster , titian at the national gallery , to a small local history exhibition in a deprived area of merseyside .
mr grossman said : " the aim of the prize is to reward innovation and excellence and also to enhance public awareness of our museums .
" all of our short listed entrants are worthy of attention and commendation .
my fellow judges and i are hugely looking forward to our visits around the country . "

the group - which includes human rights watch and amnesty international - calls on the un security council to renew its efforts against states and armed groups that use children in war .
among its ambitious recommendations is ending the flow of weapons to those recruiting children , placing travel restrictions on leaders who use children in their armies and ending military assistance to them .
the un is due to debate the issue of children and armed conflict next week .
the coalition 's report is designed to prick the organisation 's conscience on a particularly intractable form of human rights abuse .

leader of the pan- malaysian islamic party 's youth wing , ahmad sabki yusof , wrote a letter to the government saying she promoted un-islamic principles .
" everyone knows mariah carey presents herself in a sexy , unacceptable and almost vulgar manner , " he said .
carey has received official permission to perform , but has been warned her costumes should not offend people .
she is due to perform a concert in kuala lumpur at a 50,000-seater stadium on 22 february .
but mr ahmad sabki said she was " not an appropriate role model for young malaysians " . "
we do n't want immoral values for our children , whether muslim or not " ahmad sabki yusof " allowing such concerts promotes and condones values that are totally contrary to our way of life and our culture , " he said .
" we do n't want immoral values for our children , whether muslim or not . "
assurances he also said the concert fell on the date marking the start of the new year in the muslim calendar .
the letter of protest has been delivered to the ministry of culture , arts and tourism , calling on it to rescind permission for carey to perform .
carey has reportedly already assured the government she would comply with dress regulations .
although western entertainment is popular in malaysia , officials have long been worried about its effect on its people .

but a new type of gamepad from a us fitness equipment company aims to turn the couch potato gamer stereotype on its head .
the kilowatt controller by powergrid is designed to build up muscle while playing a playstation 2 , xbox or pc game .
" we take the guilt out of gaming and put the fun back into exercise , " said company spokesman chuck martinez .
" the reason most exercise machines end up in the garage in the home is that exercise is incredibly boring . "
the controller made its debut at last week 's consumer electronics show in las vegas , winning an innovation award .
pumping iron the kilowatt gaming system is a life-size controller that forces gamers to use their muscles to play .
the traditional thumb sticks and buttons on a gamepad are blended into a single shoulder-height joystick . "
with isometrics , unlike lifting weights , you wo n't see anything move but your muscles will let you know they are working out " dr dan drury , sport medicine expert the controller is attached to an alloy steel resistance rod and a sensor array .
the sensors measure the microscopic flex in the rod as a gamer pushes and pulls on it .
this is translated into data for the game console , as well as calculating the amount of force used .
in a racing game like gran turismo , the harder you push on the joystick , the faster a car goes , while pulling back slows down the vehicle .
the system works on the principle of isometric exercise , which contracts the muscles without moving any joints .
after just a couple of minutes of playing gran turismo with the joystick , you can feel the strain in your upper arms and shoulder muscles .
" with isometrics , unlike lifting weights , you wo n't see anything move but your muscles will let you know they are working out , " said dr dan drury , a sport medicine expert who is a paid adviser to powergrid .
" with the kilowatt , you are expending calories and you are breaking a sweat .
it is actually physically difficult . "
price point the device costs $ 695 and will be available in the us from late spring .
the company is currently working on getting the product into europe and asia .
despite the relatively high price tag for a gaming accessory , the company is confident there is a market for this type of gadget .
it sees the kilowatt as a piece of exercise equipment , saying it costs less than a good quality treadmill for the home .
" the average age of people who buy fitness equipment is 31 , " mr martinez told bbc news online , " and the average age of gamers is 29 . "
" the kilowatt is at the intersection of these two and that demographic is capable of paying that kind of price . "
although the gaming system is aimed at the home , the company says it could be used in gyms as it meets the requirements of commercial exercise equipment .
