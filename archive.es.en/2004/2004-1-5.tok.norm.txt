after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .

after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .

christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .

the country ’ s figurehead gets elected by the so-called federal assembly , which convenes every five years for this purpose and is made up of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 federal states . president johannes rau , who was nominated by spd and greens in 1999 , won ’ t be seeking reelection .
the christian democrats will send the most delegates and are therefore likely to secure victory for their candidate with the support of the neoliberal free democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .
5 , followed by voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony on sept .
19 .
christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .
two weeks later , thuringians will head to the polls again for municipal elections , followed on sept .
26 by voters in north-rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state . the latter elections are seen as a crucial test for the 2005 state polls that will take place there .
should the christian democrats win the state after decades of spd rule , they would hold a two-thirds majority in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , and could block legislation proposed by the government . choosing a new head of state one election most germans won ’ t have a direct say in , is the vote for a new president on may 23 .
the country ’ s figurehead gets elected by the so-called federal assembly , which convenes every five years for this purpose and is made up of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 federal states . president johannes rau , who was nominated by spd and greens in 1999 , won ’ t be seeking reelection .
the christian democrats will send the most delegates and are therefore likely to secure victory for their candidate with the support of the neoliberal free democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble .
favorites so far are wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former government minister and cdu party leader who sits in a wheel chair after a 1990 assassination attempt and un under-secretary-gerneral klaus töpfer , who heads the organization ’ s environment program .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .
they ’ ve registered on a web site sponsored by the foundation for public health and smoking which is geared towards providing support for potential quitters .
" most people who register on the site say they want to quit for health reasons " , foundation director trudy prins told reporters on new year ’ s day , " but i think that for many people the fact that they will no longer be able to smoke in the workplace has helped give them that extra push . "
smoke-free europe across europe , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crack down on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 .
but in germany , the government has been accused of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public places .
eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .
he has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking declines in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers stays relatively constant .
but even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .

germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .
5 , followed by voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony on sept .
19 .
christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .
two weeks later , thuringians will head to the polls again for municipal elections , followed on sept .
26 by voters in north-rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state . the latter elections are seen as a crucial test for the 2005 state polls that will take place there .
should the christian democrats win the state after decades of spd rule , they would hold a two-thirds majority in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , and could block legislation proposed by the government . choosing a new head of state one election most germans won ’ t have a direct say in , is the vote for a new president on may 23 .
the country ’ s figurehead gets elected by the so-called federal assembly , which convenes every five years for this purpose and is made up of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 federal states . president johannes rau , who was nominated by spd and greens in 1999 , won ’ t be seeking reelection .
the christian democrats will send the most delegates and are therefore likely to secure victory for their candidate with the support of the neoliberal free democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble .
favorites so far are wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former government minister and cdu party leader who sits in a wheel chair after a 1990 assassination attempt and un under-secretary-gerneral klaus töpfer , who heads the organization ’ s environment program .
chancellor gerhard schröder on the other hand has said his party might support a female cdu nominee for germany ’ s highest office . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg 's center-right coalition government collapses shaky ever since a cabinet minister allegedly threatened to out hamburg ’ s mayor as gay last august , the city state ’ s center-right coalition government collapsed on tuesday .
new elections are likely in february .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .
“ the age of rubens : genovese homes , patrons and collectors ” opens march 20 and runs through july 11 in the doge ’ s apartment in palazzo ducale . works made for ruben ’ s volume of etchings , “ the palaces of genoa , ” will be also included .
and the rooms in which the pictures will be displayed will be set up to recreate the atmosphere - complete with aristocratic furnishings and tapestries - that once housed the art . in all , nearly 120 cultural exhibitions are planned throughout the year .

in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .

great britain is deliberating a crack down on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 .
but in germany , the government has been accused of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public places .
eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .
he has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .

in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .

smoke-free europe across europe , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crack down on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 .
but in germany , the government has been accused of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public places .
eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .
he has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .
5 , followed by voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony on sept .
19 .
christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .
two weeks later , thuringians will head to the polls again for municipal elections , followed on sept .
26 by voters in north-rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state . the latter elections are seen as a crucial test for the 2005 state polls that will take place there .
should the christian democrats win the state after decades of spd rule , they would hold a two-thirds majority in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , and could block legislation proposed by the government . choosing a new head of state one election most germans won ’ t have a direct say in , is the vote for a new president on may 23 .
the country ’ s figurehead gets elected by the so-called federal assembly , which convenes every five years for this purpose and is made up of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 federal states . president johannes rau , who was nominated by spd and greens in 1999 , won ’ t be seeking reelection .
the christian democrats will send the most delegates and are therefore likely to secure victory for their candidate with the support of the neoliberal free democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble .
favorites so far are wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former government minister and cdu party leader who sits in a wheel chair after a 1990 assassination attempt and un under-secretary-gerneral klaus töpfer , who heads the organization ’ s environment program .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .
“ the age of rubens : genovese homes , patrons and collectors ” opens march 20 and runs through july 11 in the doge ’ s apartment in palazzo ducale . works made for ruben ’ s volume of etchings , “ the palaces of genoa , ” will be also included .
and the rooms in which the pictures will be displayed will be set up to recreate the atmosphere - complete with aristocratic furnishings and tapestries - that once housed the art . in all , nearly 120 cultural exhibitions are planned throughout the year .

while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

they are seeking to find answers to how € 8 billion went missing from the company 's balance sheet .
milan public prosecutors were investigating whether insider trading and share price manipulation had occurred in the trading of shares of parmalat finanziaria , the parent of parmalat .
in the coming days , executives of germany ’ s deutsche bank as well as three italian credit institutions are expected to be interrograted , italy ’ s corriere della serra newspaper reported on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? business -pipe- 05.01.2004 euro goes east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu states will have to wait a while for their euro starter kits .
after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

they are seeking to find answers to how € 8 billion went missing from the company 's balance sheet .
milan public prosecutors were investigating whether insider trading and share price manipulation had occurred in the trading of shares of parmalat finanziaria , the parent of parmalat .
in the coming days , executives of germany ’ s deutsche bank as well as three italian credit institutions are expected to be interrograted , italy ’ s corriere della serra newspaper reported on monday .
prosecutors in parma and milan are reported to be interested in why deutsche bank doubled its shares in parmalat holding company parmalat finanziaria to 5.2 percent in november , despite the fact the company was on the verge of bankruptcy .
since then , deutsche bank has reduced its holdings to less than 2 percent .
investigators reportedly were expected to probe deutsche bank capital transfers between south america , the cayman islands , the eastern u.s. state of delaware , luxembourg and malta . -lrb- dsl -rrb- more briefs 02.01.2004 -pipe- european manufacturing climbs in december 02.01.2004 -pipe- overtime hours declined in 2003 02.01.2004 -pipe- german stocks hit 4000 30.12.2003 -pipe- opposition decries government 's tollcollect call 30.12.2003 -pipe- imports of bubbly , caviar lower in germany 30.12.2003 -pipe- german exports up despite euro strength 30.12.2003 -pipe- german car buyers are aging 29.12.2003 -pipe- ig farben shareholders demand compensation from ubs radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .
5 , followed by voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony on sept .
19 .
christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .
two weeks later , thuringians will head to the polls again for municipal elections , followed on sept .
26 by voters in north-rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state . the latter elections are seen as a crucial test for the 2005 state polls that will take place there .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .
“ the age of rubens : genovese homes , patrons and collectors ” opens march 20 and runs through july 11 in the doge ’ s apartment in palazzo ducale . works made for ruben ’ s volume of etchings , “ the palaces of genoa , ” will be also included .
and the rooms in which the pictures will be displayed will be set up to recreate the atmosphere - complete with aristocratic furnishings and tapestries - that once housed the art . in all , nearly 120 cultural exhibitions are planned throughout the year .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .
5 , followed by voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony on sept .
19 .
christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .
two weeks later , thuringians will head to the polls again for municipal elections , followed on sept .
26 by voters in north-rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state . the latter elections are seen as a crucial test for the 2005 state polls that will take place there .
should the christian democrats win the state after decades of spd rule , they would hold a two-thirds majority in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , and could block legislation proposed by the government . choosing a new head of state one election most germans won ’ t have a direct say in , is the vote for a new president on may 23 .
the country ’ s figurehead gets elected by the so-called federal assembly , which convenes every five years for this purpose and is made up of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 federal states . president johannes rau , who was nominated by spd and greens in 1999 , won ’ t be seeking reelection .
the christian democrats will send the most delegates and are therefore likely to secure victory for their candidate with the support of the neoliberal free democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble .
favorites so far are wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former government minister and cdu party leader who sits in a wheel chair after a 1990 assassination attempt and un under-secretary-gerneral klaus töpfer , who heads the organization ’ s environment program .
chancellor gerhard schröder on the other hand has said his party might support a female cdu nominee for germany ’ s highest office . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg 's center-right coalition government collapses shaky ever since a cabinet minister allegedly threatened to out hamburg ’ s mayor as gay last august , the city state ’ s center-right coalition government collapsed on tuesday .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .

nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2004 a law to help kick the habit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of quitters succeed in stopping smoking it usually tops new year ’ s resolution lists : the pledge to stop smoking .
in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .
they ’ ve registered on a web site sponsored by the foundation for public health and smoking which is geared towards providing support for potential quitters .

eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .

in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .
they ’ ve registered on a web site sponsored by the foundation for public health and smoking which is geared towards providing support for potential quitters .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .

budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .

since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .
5 , followed by voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony on sept .
19 .
christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .
two weeks later , thuringians will head to the polls again for municipal elections , followed on sept .
26 by voters in north-rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state . the latter elections are seen as a crucial test for the 2005 state polls that will take place there .
should the christian democrats win the state after decades of spd rule , they would hold a two-thirds majority in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , and could block legislation proposed by the government . choosing a new head of state one election most germans won ’ t have a direct say in , is the vote for a new president on may 23 .
the country ’ s figurehead gets elected by the so-called federal assembly , which convenes every five years for this purpose and is made up of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 federal states . president johannes rau , who was nominated by spd and greens in 1999 , won ’ t be seeking reelection .
the christian democrats will send the most delegates and are therefore likely to secure victory for their candidate with the support of the neoliberal free democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble .
favorites so far are wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former government minister and cdu party leader who sits in a wheel chair after a 1990 assassination attempt and un under-secretary-gerneral klaus töpfer , who heads the organization ’ s environment program .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .
“ the age of rubens : genovese homes , patrons and collectors ” opens march 20 and runs through july 11 in the doge ’ s apartment in palazzo ducale . works made for ruben ’ s volume of etchings , “ the palaces of genoa , ” will be also included .
and the rooms in which the pictures will be displayed will be set up to recreate the atmosphere - complete with aristocratic furnishings and tapestries - that once housed the art . in all , nearly 120 cultural exhibitions are planned throughout the year .
“ we can be happy if we somehow succeed in creating a new image for genoa internationally , ” said stefano zara , president of an industry trade group in the city . dw staff -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lille : breaking out of the grey zone the former industrial city in the north of france was named a european cultural capital for 2004 .

add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .

the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .
“ the age of rubens : genovese homes , patrons and collectors ” opens march 20 and runs through july 11 in the doge ’ s apartment in palazzo ducale . works made for ruben ’ s volume of etchings , “ the palaces of genoa , ” will be also included .
and the rooms in which the pictures will be displayed will be set up to recreate the atmosphere - complete with aristocratic furnishings and tapestries - that once housed the art . in all , nearly 120 cultural exhibitions are planned throughout the year .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .

in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .

smoke-free europe across europe , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crack down on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 .
but in germany , the government has been accused of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public places .
eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .
he has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .

national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .

in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .
they ’ ve registered on a web site sponsored by the foundation for public health and smoking which is geared towards providing support for potential quitters .
" most people who register on the site say they want to quit for health reasons " , foundation director trudy prins told reporters on new year ’ s day , " but i think that for many people the fact that they will no longer be able to smoke in the workplace has helped give them that extra push . "
smoke-free europe across europe , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crack down on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 .
but in germany , the government has been accused of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public places .
eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .
he has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking declines in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers stays relatively constant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? business -pipe- 05.01.2004 euro goes east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu states will have to wait a while for their euro starter kits .
after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .
5 , followed by voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony on sept .
19 .
christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .
two weeks later , thuringians will head to the polls again for municipal elections , followed on sept .
26 by voters in north-rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state . the latter elections are seen as a crucial test for the 2005 state polls that will take place there .
should the christian democrats win the state after decades of spd rule , they would hold a two-thirds majority in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , and could block legislation proposed by the government . choosing a new head of state one election most germans won ’ t have a direct say in , is the vote for a new president on may 23 .
the country ’ s figurehead gets elected by the so-called federal assembly , which convenes every five years for this purpose and is made up of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 federal states . president johannes rau , who was nominated by spd and greens in 1999 , won ’ t be seeking reelection .
the christian democrats will send the most delegates and are therefore likely to secure victory for their candidate with the support of the neoliberal free democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble .
favorites so far are wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former government minister and cdu party leader who sits in a wheel chair after a 1990 assassination attempt and un under-secretary-gerneral klaus töpfer , who heads the organization ’ s environment program .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.01.2004 a law to help kick the habit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 8 percent of quitters succeed in stopping smoking it usually tops new year ’ s resolution lists : the pledge to stop smoking .
in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .
they ’ ve registered on a web site sponsored by the foundation for public health and smoking which is geared towards providing support for potential quitters .
" most people who register on the site say they want to quit for health reasons " , foundation director trudy prins told reporters on new year ’ s day , " but i think that for many people the fact that they will no longer be able to smoke in the workplace has helped give them that extra push . "
smoke-free europe across europe , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crack down on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 .
but in germany , the government has been accused of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public places .
eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .
he has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking declines in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers stays relatively constant .
but even more alarming , the starting age for first-time smokers is dropping .
as of 2003 , every third ninth grader smoked . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for public smoking ban germany has long been a paradise for tobacco friends , but now some politicians are coming out in favor of stricter , american-style anti-smoking laws to protect people against secondhand smoke .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .

christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .
“ the age of rubens : genovese homes , patrons and collectors ” opens march 20 and runs through july 11 in the doge ’ s apartment in palazzo ducale . works made for ruben ’ s volume of etchings , “ the palaces of genoa , ” will be also included .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the new europe the eve of enlargement verheugen : eu expansion brings peace and profit a final report card for new eu members where is europe headed ? business -pipe- 05.01.2004 euro goes east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new eu states will have to wait a while for their euro starter kits .
after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .

eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .
he has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .
“ the age of rubens : genovese homes , patrons and collectors ” opens march 20 and runs through july 11 in the doge ’ s apartment in palazzo ducale . works made for ruben ’ s volume of etchings , “ the palaces of genoa , ” will be also included .
and the rooms in which the pictures will be displayed will be set up to recreate the atmosphere - complete with aristocratic furnishings and tapestries - that once housed the art . in all , nearly 120 cultural exhibitions are planned throughout the year .
“ we can be happy if we somehow succeed in creating a new image for genoa internationally , ” said stefano zara , president of an industry trade group in the city . dw staff -lrb- so -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lille : breaking out of the grey zone the former industrial city in the north of france was named a european cultural capital for 2004 .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .
“ the age of rubens : genovese homes , patrons and collectors ” opens march 20 and runs through july 11 in the doge ’ s apartment in palazzo ducale . works made for ruben ’ s volume of etchings , “ the palaces of genoa , ” will be also included .
and the rooms in which the pictures will be displayed will be set up to recreate the atmosphere - complete with aristocratic furnishings and tapestries - that once housed the art . in all , nearly 120 cultural exhibitions are planned throughout the year .

germans will vote a lot this year : a dozen regional elections have been scheduled and all citizens can participate in the eu parliamentary elections in june .
germany ’ s new head of state will also be chosen . german national elections won ’ t take place until 2006 , but many view the 2004 voting marathon as a barometer of public opinion on berlin ’ s governing coalition of social democrats and greens , which has lost much ground in opinion polls and surveys . christian democrats likely to win eu elections german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s best bet to gauge his standing with voters will likely be the elections for the european union parliament on june 13 .
germany ’ s conservative opposition seems set to repeat its victory in the 1999 eu elections , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flags outside the european parliament building in strasbourg , france the eu ’ s legislature in strasbourg currently has 53 members belonging to the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- while the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- only hold 35 seats . state elections from hamburg to saxony the spd has better chances in hamburg , where voters will choose a new parliament for the city state on feb .
29 .
after decades of social democratic rule , current mayor ole von beust -lrb- cdu -rrb- was elected in 2001 , but called for early elections in december after the collapse of his center-right coalition government . beust is hoping to secure an absolute majority as polls show his former coalition partners are below the 5 percent hurdle they need to clear to enter parliament .
should beust fail to get enough support , the spd is likely to return to power with the support of the greens . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thuringia 's premier dieter althaus -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
voters in the eastern german state of thuringia will choose a new parliament on june 13 .
the christian democrats hold an absolute majority , which former premier bernhard vogel won four years ago .
victory is also likely for his successor , dieter althaus -lrb- photo -rrb- , who will have been in office for just over a year by election day . three more state elections will take place in september : the people of the western german state of saarland will go to the polls on sept .
5 , followed by voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony on sept .
19 .
christian democrats hold an absolute majority in saarland and saxony and are likely to stay in power . in brandenburg , the spd has been governing since reunification , but could end up becoming the junior partner in the current coalition with the cdu : in last year ’ s municipal elections , social democrats only received 23.5 percent of votes . municipal elections in seven states germany ’ s super sunday will take place on june 13 : apart from the eu and thuringia state elections , voters in baden-württemberg , mecklenburg-western pommerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony-anhalt and saxony will choose new mayors , city and regional governments .
two weeks later , thuringians will head to the polls again for municipal elections , followed on sept .
26 by voters in north-rhine-westphalia , germany ’ s most populous state . the latter elections are seen as a crucial test for the 2005 state polls that will take place there .
should the christian democrats win the state after decades of spd rule , they would hold a two-thirds majority in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , and could block legislation proposed by the government . choosing a new head of state one election most germans won ’ t have a direct say in , is the vote for a new president on may 23 .
the country ’ s figurehead gets elected by the so-called federal assembly , which convenes every five years for this purpose and is made up of members of germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , and an equal number of delegates from the 16 federal states . president johannes rau , who was nominated by spd and greens in 1999 , won ’ t be seeking reelection .
the christian democrats will send the most delegates and are therefore likely to secure victory for their candidate with the support of the neoliberal free democrats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble .
favorites so far are wolfgang schäuble -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former government minister and cdu party leader who sits in a wheel chair after a 1990 assassination attempt and un under-secretary-gerneral klaus töpfer , who heads the organization ’ s environment program .

in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .

in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

after 10 countries join the eu in may , they will adopt the euro as their currency .
while some are likely to fulfill the criteria for entering the monetary union soon , others still have a long way ahead of them . eastern european states should adopt the common currency as quickly as possible to reap the benefits , said werner becker , senior economist at deutsche bank research in frankfurt . “ they ’ ll be able to enjoy low interest rates , a stable currency , a fixed exchange rate with main trading partners as well as with the euroland , where most direct investments come from , ” becker said .
he added that without the risk of fluctuating exchange rates , companies in these countries can better plan and act .
thus , the euro would stimulate economic growth . joining too early hinders growth but there are also those arguing against an early accession to the euro .
the new eu countries could actually be slowed down in their attempt to catch up economically with the rest of the union , according to hermann rempsberger , a member of the german federal bank ’ s executive board . trying to catch up with the other eu countries , the new member states - cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , the slovak republic , and slovenia - are likely to experience higher inflation rates . so far , they have been able to counter this by devaluing their currency .
but that will no longer be possible once they have joined the euro zone .
one consequence of the fixed currency is the risk of losing their competitive economic advantage , rempsberger said . criteria to join the euro zone pose hurdle in order to adopt the common currency , the new eu member states have to fulfil the criteria set up in the maastricht treaty : the rate of inflation can not exceed that of the euro zone ’ s three most stable countries by more than 1.5 percentage points .
long-term interest rates can only be 2 percentage points higher than in those countries .
no exchange rate realignment for at least two years .
a government budget deficit of no more than 3 percent of gross domestic product .
national debt can not be higher than 60 percent of gross domestic product . already , it ’ s possible to see countries moving towards fulfilling those criteria , similar to portugal or spain , who unexpectedly managed to be among the first to join the euro zone .
budget deficits in some countries are worrisome , however : those of hungary , poland or the czech republic are still well above the 3 percent cut-off line . high achievers and problem children as far as national debt is concerned , however , all central and eastern european candidates to join the union in 2004 are in the clear .
nevertheless , there are big differences between them : while estonia ’ s national debt is 5 percent of gdp , hungary ’ s has reached 53 percent of its gdp . as far as the exchange rate alignment is concerned , some countries have come quite close to the euro already .
hungary ’ s exchange rate stays within plus or minus 15 percent against the euro - the same fluctuation margin currently in place for the european exchange rate mechanism .
estonia and lithuania have practically tied their currencies to the euro by means of a currency board , almost as if they had already joined the euro . euro not before 2007 the road to euroland still remains a long one , however .
since the 10 countries are supposed to join the european union in 2004 , the euro probably will not become their official currency before 2007 , as the candidates have to spend the required two years within the european exchange rate mechanism . while that ’ s still three years away , deutsche bank ’ s werner becker has also come up with his list of top candidates : “ estonia , poland , the czech republic , hungary and slovenia will quickly make it , i expect . ” johannes beck -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro hits record high against dollar trade disputes pushed the euro to a record high against the u.s. dollar on tuesday .

in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .
they ’ ve registered on a web site sponsored by the foundation for public health and smoking which is geared towards providing support for potential quitters .

smoke-free europe across europe , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crack down on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 .
but in germany , the government has been accused of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public places .
eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .
he has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking declines in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers stays relatively constant .

in the netherlands , smokers will get some added encouragement to kick the habit with strict new anti-smoking laws which go into effect this year . with the start of the new year , smokers across europe invariably throw away their unopened pack of cigarettes , hide their lighters and go out of the way to avoid people who continue to puff away - at least for a few days until the will to kick the habit succumbs to the urge to light up .
in the netherlands , the resolutely-minded are given an extra boost of encouragement to stop smoking for all time .
as of jan .
1 , a series of strict new anti-smoking laws make cigarette breaks virtually impossible .
the new legislation prohibits smoking in public places and on public transport , in taxis and at bus and train stations , as well as at the workplace .
employees will only be allowed to smoke in special rooms equipped with extractor fans .
although employers are under no obligation to provide for such arrangements , those who permit workers to smoke in offices face fines ranging from 300 to 2,400 euros .
under the law , smoking is also banned in areas such as stairs , hallways , conference rooms , cafeterias and toilets .
hotels , bars , restaurants and international trains , however , have won a temporary reprieve to permit smoking , but only on condition that they find a compromise by 2005 .
the tough new legislation is designed to cut the number of smokers down by 5 percent over the next three years .
official estimates say that out of a population of 16 million , there are around 4.4 million smokers in the netherlands - one of the higher rates in europe .
so far some 850,000 dutch have pledged to kick the habit in 2004 .
they ’ ve registered on a web site sponsored by the foundation for public health and smoking which is geared towards providing support for potential quitters .
" most people who register on the site say they want to quit for health reasons " , foundation director trudy prins told reporters on new year ’ s day , " but i think that for many people the fact that they will no longer be able to smoke in the workplace has helped give them that extra push . "
smoke-free europe across europe , enjoying a cigarette is becoming increasingly difficult as governments consider implementing anti-smoking legislation .
sweden has already passed a tough anti-smoking law that will go into effect in 2005 , and ireland is also on the verge of passing a ban similar to the one in the netherlands .
great britain is deliberating a crack down on smoking in public spaces , but after a heated round of debate from the country ’ s pub owners , the government has decided to postpone any decision until later in 2004 .
but in germany , the government has been accused of taking too soft a stance on smoking in public places .
eu commissioner for health and consumer protection david byrne has said that germany is not doing enough to fight nicotine addiction .
he has criticized the government for taking an " easygoing " stance to smoking considering that an estimated 100,000 germans die of smoking-related diseases every year .
moreover , the eu commission , which launched an anti-smoking campaign last year called " feel free to say no , " has accused berlin of trying to block a comprehensive world-wide anti-smoking initiative by the world health organization , which is already supported by over 190 countries .
in the past years , germany has also come out strongly against an eu initiative to ban cigarette advertising across europe .
next to spain and greece , germany has the highest rate of smokers in europe .
statistics collected by the federal health ministry also show that while smoking declines in the rest of europe , germany ’ s number of smokers stays relatively constant .

after years of suffering from industrial decline and the aftermath of violent demonstrations during world trade talks in 2001 , this italian port city is focusing on plans for its year as cultural capital of europe . italians call genoa " la superba , " their pride in the port city stretching back through the centuries .
it is the birthplace of christopher columbus .
and a mecca for pesto-lovers : so deep is the city ’ s love of its native dish that plans for a basil park are being discussed . more recently , though , genoa has struggled to reinvigorate an economy suffering from the decline of manufacturing .
add to this the violent demonstrations over globalization that accompanied the july 2001 group of eight summit meeting that lead to the death of one protester , and it is clear that genoa is a city that needs help with public relations . so many residents of this northern italian city have high hopes for the coming year , as genoa takes the stage as culture capital of europe , an honor it shares with the french city of lille . “ this is the opportunity to let people know how the city has changed , how interesting it is , ” enrico da mola , head of the ge-nova promotion agency told deutsche welle .
“ this is our challenge for 2004 . ” working for change from its palaces to its back alleys , genoa has been polishing its facades in anticipation of this year , when a plethora of music , dance , art and literary events are planned and thousands of international tourists are expected . “ everything is changing here , ” said one resident .
“ we genoans suddenly have a completely different feel for our city .
we want to make everything really beautiful . ” in fact , the city has been focusing on several major renovation projects for more than a decade .
world-class architect renzo piano , who lives in genoa , completely redesigned the city ’ s old port in 1992 , turning it into a multi-functional leisure center .
with this renovation , walls were removed that blocked off the city ’ s medieval center from the sea . museum of the sea to open in march one of the major projects planned for 2004 is the inauguration of the museum of the sea and navigation in march .
it was created out of several existing museums that were redesigned by spanish architect guillermo vazquez consuegra .
museum visitors will be able to take a voyage through time and the culture of the sea . another attraction is a 42-meter-long boat reconstructed after three years of historical research .
the military ship , known as a galley , stems from the 17th century and was much more than just a boat : it was a way of life for the sailors , officials and passengers on board .
the various environments that will be shown include a cabin , pantry , sail room , ropes store and surgeon ’ s room . the construction of the boat began in september 2002 at a belgian shipyard and it was delivered in four pieces to genoa last fall .
it was built after an in-depth historical and architectural investigation by giorgio carosio , researcher at the marine and navigation pavilion , and architect franco giorgetti . several other new museums will open during the course of the year .
among them will be the jewish museum of genoa , which will open in september with an exhibition called “ chagall and the bible . ”
the museum , located in the upper floor of a synagogue , will tell the story of genoa ’ s jewish community . homage to rubens the city will also pay homage to pieter paul rubens , the 17th century flemish painter who spent time in the region in 1607 .
“ the age of rubens : genovese homes , patrons and collectors ” opens march 20 and runs through july 11 in the doge ’ s apartment in palazzo ducale . works made for ruben ’ s volume of etchings , “ the palaces of genoa , ” will be also included .
and the rooms in which the pictures will be displayed will be set up to recreate the atmosphere - complete with aristocratic furnishings and tapestries - that once housed the art . in all , nearly 120 cultural exhibitions are planned throughout the year .

the exchange rate of the local currencies like the franc and the deutschemark in relation to the euro was fixed at that time .
the euro immediately began to fall on international currency markets , unable to compete with the attractions of the dollar , boosted by a booming us stockmarket and economy .
uncertainty over the role of the european central bank , which was now setting interest rates in the eurozone , and its policy towards the weak euro , also unsettled markets .
return to graph september 2000 : central banks intervene to prop up euro the european central bank finally asked for help from other banks to help boost the value of the euro after it touched a record low of $ 0.84 .
the intervention occurred as the world 's bankers were gathering in prague for an international meeting .

and the 13 interest rate cuts by the us central bank , the federal reserve , made investors lesss likely to move more money into us markets as interest rates were higher elsewhere .

the £ 24,000 which was paid to the authorities is thought to have come from the profits of drug trafficking .
the crown office used the proceeds of crime act to take the case to court .
the lord advocate , colin boyd qc , said he welcomed the outcome and added there were already other targets under investigation .
the case was brought by the civil recovery unit -lrb- cru -rrb- , which is part of the crown office .
it started its investigation in june last year after the arrest of an aberdeen man charged with the supply of controlled drugs .
proceeds of crime civil recovery takes place in the court of session civil recovery is a longer procedure than cash seizure , taking several months £ 1.5m has been forfeited under the proceeds of crime act £ 20,360 has been forfeited by the civil recovery unit £ 58,062 has been forfeited by the criminal confiscation unit although the man was acquitted , a co-accused was found guilty .
the cru went to the court of session , arguing that he had made regular deposits totalling nearly £ 46,000 into a bank account while on benefits with no other known legitimate income .
the cru successfully argued that , on the balance of probabilities , the money represented the profits of drug trafficking and was therefore recoverable under the proceeds of crime act .
mr boyd said : " the money recovered was profit suspected to have been gained through drug trafficking at the expense of vulnerable members of our society - but it is not the amount that is significant .
" what is significant about the seizure is it demonstrates the new legislation is working and those suspected of profiting through crime are being penalised .
" this is a first for the civil recovery unit who have other targets under investigation - so we can expect more proceeds of crime to be recovered in the future .
the lord advocate , colin boyd , said the case was a uk first " in its first year of operation , the civil recovery unit used its cash seizure powers to forfeit over £ 300,000 and now their civil recovery powers are having an effect .
" these add to the existing powers to confiscate the assets of those convicted of criminal offences .
" this year criminals and those in possession of the proceeds of crime should take note that they will not be permitted to profit from the misery of others . "
he added that 50 % of the assets recovered are retained in scotland for initiatives to tackle drug issues and to help communities that have suffered as a consequence of serious and organised crime .

proceeds of crime civil recovery takes place in the court of session civil recovery is a longer procedure than cash seizure , taking several months £ 1.5m has been forfeited under the proceeds of crime act £ 20,360 has been forfeited by the civil recovery unit £ 58,062 has been forfeited by the criminal confiscation unit although the man was acquitted , a co-accused was found guilty .
the cru went to the court of session , arguing that he had made regular deposits totalling nearly £ 46,000 into a bank account while on benefits with no other known legitimate income .
the cru successfully argued that , on the balance of probabilities , the money represented the profits of drug trafficking and was therefore recoverable under the proceeds of crime act .
mr boyd said : " the money recovered was profit suspected to have been gained through drug trafficking at the expense of vulnerable members of our society - but it is not the amount that is significant .
" what is significant about the seizure is it demonstrates the new legislation is working and those suspected of profiting through crime are being penalised .
" this is a first for the civil recovery unit who have other targets under investigation - so we can expect more proceeds of crime to be recovered in the future .
the lord advocate , colin boyd , said the case was a uk first " in its first year of operation , the civil recovery unit used its cash seizure powers to forfeit over £ 300,000 and now their civil recovery powers are having an effect .
" these add to the existing powers to confiscate the assets of those convicted of criminal offences .
" this year criminals and those in possession of the proceeds of crime should take note that they will not be permitted to profit from the misery of others . "
he added that 50 % of the assets recovered are retained in scotland for initiatives to tackle drug issues and to help communities that have suffered as a consequence of serious and organised crime .

chrysler has launched its new jeep , called " rescue " , at this year 's motor show in detroit .
the name seems appropriate given the dire state of the us car industry .
indeed , the marketing blurb insists the lego-look-alike off-roader has been " designed for the most extreme situations and difficult conditions " .
welcome to the us car market , where the three home-based automotive majors are being horsewhipped by european and japanese intruders .
economic outlook unlike some of the much larger automotive shows in frankfurt , paris and geneva , the detroit one is a fairly small affair that is dominated by business issues and , to a large extent , by us domestic concerns .
2004 north american international auto show 4-6 january : press days 7-9 january : industry and charity days 10-19 january : public days it is a shocking sign of the state of the car industry in motown when its car show is no longer the biggest nor the best in the world .
once upon a time , 90 % of cars sold in the us were made by americans in detroit .
these days the cars are still mainly assembled by americans , but the factories are often based in southern states , the workers are non-unionised and the cars carry foreign badges .
by the end of this decade , all three us majors may be overtaken by toyota , which is riding on its superb reliability reputation to capture market share from the motown firms .
no wonder , then , that the car industry officials who gather in detroit this week will be keen to hear from the three us carmakers ' in-house economists .
gm 's mustafa mohatarem , ford 's ellen hughes-cromwick and chrysler 's van jollissaint will air their predictions for the year ahead at an automotive analyst conference on 6 january .
high revs but before then , the world 's media were introduced to a string of new car models during press days on 4 and 5 january .
the 612 scaglietti launch is ferrari 's first global premiere in the us .
sports cars will feature heavily at the show , with gm 's eagerly anticipated chevrolet corvette and ferrari 's 612 scaglietti expected to steal much of the attention .
ferrari 's launch marked the first time it has held a world premiere in the us .
the italian sports car maker 's 612 scaglietti was joined by fellow italian lamborghini 's murcielago and the baby-lambo gallardo .
and the launch of the latest italian heartthrobs was met by an announcement from rival aston martin .
the ford subsidiary , which launches the convertible version of its db9 volante coupe in detroit , apparently has plans to churn out 5,000 sports cars a year , a huge leap from current production figures .
sports utility this being america , there are plenty of powerful engines on show elsewhere too .
ford has " rediscovered " cars .
jeep 's rescue is joined by the ford subsidiary land rover 's latest concept , called range stormer , which is set to fit neatly between its working 4x4 defender and the more luxurious range rover .
but except for its decision to push land rover 's so-called " trucks " , ford has decided on a different route ahead , having recently changed its focus from the 4x4 market .
last year was dubbed " year of the truck " by ford .
now " ford is changing its attention and resources to cars " with 2004 being named " year of the car " .
the ford announcement comes a full year after gm 's " rediscovery " of the car market , coinciding with the ever greater push into the sports utility market by european and japanese automotive firms .
for ford , the virtual re-entry into the market for ordinary cars , with its five hundred sedan , could be tough .
since its focus changed away from car drivers , the market has been captured by non-us car makers such as germany 's bmw or japan 's honda , nissan and toyota .

unison claims a series of high-profile company failures has set " alarm bells ringing " across scotland .
the union said it intends to " expose the financial and service failings " of private finance .
it wants councils to be given the choice to find money themselves to invest in services .
' pick up the pieces ' scotland 's largest teaching union , the eis , announced last week that it was carrying out a survey among teachers in schools undergoing ppp projects , following claims by some members that inadequate facilities and delays could be affecting pupils ' education .
in october , east lothian 's £ 43m ppp scheme to refurbish , extend and maintain six secondary schools was thrown into disarray when the main construction contractor ballast went under , leaving many sub-contractors unpaid .
the local authority hopes work on the 30-year contract , which also entails construction of a swimming pool and a community learning centre , will resume next month after balfour beatty stepped in to join the consortium just before christmas .
as we can see in east lothian , the so-called ' risk transfer ' that promoters of pfi proclaim has been exposed as a myth unison under a typical school ppp project , the council awards a private sector consortium of various firms a contract to build or refurbish properties and then maintain the facilities over a period of perhaps 25 years or more .
while the private sector assumes responsibility for capital costs and the risks involved such as cost and time overruns in construction or failure to deliver an agreed level of service , the local authority in return commits to regular payments .
unison scottish secretary matt smith said his union intended to " expose the financial and service failings " of private finance .
he added : " as we can see in east lothian , the so-called ' risk transfer ' that promoters of pfi proclaim has been exposed as a myth .
" instead of the private firm carrying the risks of this £ 45m project , ballast 's parent company pulled the plug , leaving sub-contractors unpaid , schools unfinished and the local authority having to pick up the pieces . "
a spokesman for the scottish executive denied that east lothian council would face extra costs as a result of ballast 's demise .
he said : " east lothian council has said it expects construction to begin in february , bringing major improvements and new facilities to the council 's secondary schools in the longer term . "

scottish national party msp nicola sturgeon said crown office spending could flatline over the next two years .

ministers have defended their record , saying there has been a 35 % increase in the crown office and procurator fiscal service -lrb- copfs -rrb- budget .

scottish national party msp nicola sturgeon said crown office spending could flatline over the next two years .
and the overall justice budget would fall as a percentage of total spending .
ministers have defended their record , saying there has been a 35 % increase in the crown office and procurator fiscal service -lrb- copfs -rrb- budget .
the copfs , headed by lord advocate colin boyd qc , was given £ 65.1m in 2001/02 and in this financial year it received £ 87.9m , as it continued to implement major internal changes to the service .
but ms sturgeon questioned why next year 's budget , allowing for inflation , would dip slightly to £ 87.6m , followed by £ 88m in 2005/06 , just as the service prepares for changes to the high courts system now going through parliament , and a major review of sheriff courts .
a properly-resourced and managed crown office and procurator fiscal service is critical to helping cut crime and restoring public confidence in criminal justice hugh henry deputy justice minister ms sturgeon said : " that calls into question the ability of the crown office to deliver on the scottish executive 's stated commitment of cutting crime and reducing delays in our courts system .
" over the next year , the crown office will be expected to implement radical changes in both high court and sheriff court procedure .
" and if the police continue to be successful in improving detection and clear up rates , the pressure on the courts will continue to rise .
" it is hard to see how all of that can be achieved within a standstill budget .
" the suspicion yet again must be that the scottish executive 's commitment to crime is all spin and precious little substance . "
' safe , strong scotland ' but deputy justice minister hugh henry insisted the executive was committed to funding " an effective and efficient " prosecution service .
he said : " a properly-resourced and managed crown office and procurator fiscal service is critical to helping cut crime and restoring public confidence in criminal justice .
nicola sturgeon : " lack of funding " " but increased resources for the scottish justice system will only deliver results if matched by a shared commitment to improve the work of our courts through legislation where appropriate , and other practical improvements .
" we will continue to work closely with the police and those who work in our courts to deliver a safer , stronger scotland . "
mr boyd said " significant investment " was already bearing fruit , with more than 200 members of staff recruited , including 45 lawyers and 10 trainee solicitors .
" we have invested in an it system which has improved our systems for case handling , and this will allow us to make significant savings on administration expenditure which will in turn enable us to manage better within our enhanced budget , " he added .

now hard reality has kicked in once more and next year 's council tax is a pressing issue again .
on monday , 10 of devon 's county councillors , the all-party executive , will knuckle down to the job of matching up income and spending in the next financial year .
put like that , it sounds easy , but the financial and political complications of local government spending and money-raising make it one of the most heart-searching , mind-bending and frustrating of jobs in the public service arena . "
we will have to compromise " council leader brian greenslade at the meeting in county hall in exeter , the councillors will not make any decisions about the precise level of council tax to be levied on the 700,000 council tax-payers in devon .
that will not come until next month .
but they will start the detailed process of setting the budgets for each of the council 's activities , from education and social services to roads , libraries , economic development and street lighting .
they know what they would like to do to improve services and meet expectations .
but according to the report which will be waiting for them on their desks , this would cost £ 633m - and that 's impossible .
council leader brian greenslade , said : " however much we would like to set the budget at this level , it 's simply not affordable .
" we will have to compromise . "
pensioners ' protest mr greenslade and his colleagues are still bruised by last year 's budget-setting , when a total budget of a mere £ 616m was only achieved by putting up the council tax by a massive 17.9 % .
he justifies that move because the majority of services were protected , but it led to an unprecedented protest from pensioners who found the increase unaffordable .
the protest went national and has grown , with several hundred devon pensioners still refusing to pay all the increase and talking of forming a party to stand in local elections to publicise their cause .
the councillors now find themselves caught in a classic pincer movement .
on one side are protesting taxpayers who want services but no more tax increases . "
my vote would be for an income related tax " christine , exmouth on the other is an increasingly worried national government which still pays for the bulk of the budget and is warning the council its financial plan will be capped if it means next year 's council tax increases would then be " excessive " .
it is not surprising then when brian greenslade adds : " we 'll have to spend a lot of time finding a sensible compromise between protecting essential services and a council tax level which recognises the low income levels in our county . "
one decision has already been made .
education , the biggest amount on the annual bill , will get all the money the government says it should .
life should also be eased slightly by the extra £ 4.3m that gordon brown doled out to devon last month , specifically to keep down next year 's tax .
but councillors say it still means devon is getting the third lowest percentage grant increase of any shire county , and if devon 's council tax increases are to be kept down to single figures , then cuts in jobs and services may still be necessary .
monday 's meeting is the first step on that short but difficult journey to set next year 's council tax that will culminate in the full council meeting next month .
after that , expect a boost to two campaigns .
the first by the pensioners , who will find any increase at all unacceptable .
the second , by the county council itself , to change the whole heart-aching system of how we pay for what we use .

now hard reality has kicked in once more and next year 's council tax is a pressing issue again .
on monday , 10 of devon 's county councillors , the all-party executive , will knuckle down to the job of matching up income and spending in the next financial year .
put like that , it sounds easy , but the financial and political complications of local government spending and money-raising make it one of the most heart-searching , mind-bending and frustrating of jobs in the public service arena .
we will have to compromise council leader brian greenslade at the meeting in county hall in exeter , the councillors will not make any decisions about the precise level of council tax to be levied on the 700,000 council tax-payers in devon .
that will not come until next month .
but they will start the detailed process of setting the budgets for each of the council 's activities , from education and social services to roads , libraries , economic development and street lighting .
they know what they would like to do to improve services and meet expectations .
but according to the report which will be waiting for them on their desks , this would cost £ 633m - and that 's impossible .
council leader brian greenslade , said : " however much we would like to set the budget at this level , it 's simply not affordable .
" we will have to compromise . "
pensioners ' protest mr greenslade and his colleagues are still bruised by last year 's budget-setting , when a total budget of a mere £ 616m was only achieved by putting up the council tax by a massive 17.9 % .
he justifies that move because the majority of services were protected , but it led to an unprecedented protest from pensioners who found the increase unaffordable .
the protest went national and has grown , with several hundred devon pensioners still refusing to pay all the increase and talking of forming a party to stand in local elections to publicise their cause .
the councillors now find themselves caught in a classic pincer movement .
on one side are protesting taxpayers who want services but no more tax increases .
my vote would be for an income related tax christine , exmouth have your say on bbc devon 's website on the other is an increasingly worried national government which still pays for the bulk of the budget and is warning the council its financial plan will be capped if it means next year 's council tax increases would then be " excessive " .
it is not surprising then when brian greenslade adds : " we 'll have to spend a lot of time finding a sensible compromise between protecting essential services and a council tax level which recognises the low income levels in our county . "
one decision has already been made .
education , the biggest amount on the annual bill , will get all the money the government says it should .
life should also be eased slightly by the extra £ 4.3m that gordon brown doled out to devon last month , specifically to keep down next year 's tax .
but councillors say it still means devon is getting the third lowest percentage grant increase of any shire county , and if devon 's council tax increases are to be kept down to single figures , then cuts in jobs and services may still be necessary .
monday 's meeting is the first step on that short but difficult journey to set next year 's council tax that will culminate in the full council meeting next month .

now hard reality has kicked in once more and next year 's council tax is a pressing issue again .
on monday , 10 of devon 's county councillors , the all-party executive , will knuckle down to the job of matching up income and spending in the next financial year .
put like that , it sounds easy , but the financial and political complications of local government spending and money-raising make it one of the most heart-searching , mind-bending and frustrating of jobs in the public service arena .
we will have to compromise council leader brian greenslade at the meeting in county hall in exeter , the councillors will not make any decisions about the precise level of council tax to be levied on the 700,000 council tax-payers in devon .
that will not come until next month .
but they will start the detailed process of setting the budgets for each of the council 's activities , from education and social services to roads , libraries , economic development and street lighting .
they know what they would like to do to improve services and meet expectations .
but according to the report which will be waiting for them on their desks , this would cost £ 633m - and that 's impossible .
council leader brian greenslade , said : " however much we would like to set the budget at this level , it 's simply not affordable .
" we will have to compromise . "
pensioners ' protest mr greenslade and his colleagues are still bruised by last year 's budget-setting , when a total budget of a mere £ 616m was only achieved by putting up the council tax by a massive 17.9 % .
he justifies that move because the majority of services were protected , but it led to an unprecedented protest from pensioners who found the increase unaffordable .
the protest went national and has grown , with several hundred devon pensioners still refusing to pay all the increase and talking of forming a party to stand in local elections to publicise their cause .
the councillors now find themselves caught in a classic pincer movement .
on one side are protesting taxpayers who want services but no more tax increases .
my vote would be for an income related tax christine , exmouth have your say on bbc devon 's website on the other is an increasingly worried national government which still pays for the bulk of the budget and is warning the council its financial plan will be capped if it means next year 's council tax increases would then be " excessive " .
it is not surprising then when brian greenslade adds : " we 'll have to spend a lot of time finding a sensible compromise between protecting essential services and a council tax level which recognises the low income levels in our county . "
one decision has already been made .
education , the biggest amount on the annual bill , will get all the money the government says it should .
life should also be eased slightly by the extra £ 4.3m that gordon brown doled out to devon last month , specifically to keep down next year 's tax .
but councillors say it still means devon is getting the third lowest percentage grant increase of any shire county , and if devon 's council tax increases are to be kept down to single figures , then cuts in jobs and services may still be necessary .
monday 's meeting is the first step on that short but difficult journey to set next year 's council tax that will culminate in the full council meeting next month .
after that , expect a boost to two campaigns .

after teaching for five years in a catholic school i went back to university to study english literature and had the chance to come to the uk .

i also like the village atmosphere , the sense of different londons within london , the way in one day you can be in three different worlds .
but i do n't like the feeling of insecurity and the rudeness , on public transport , for example , and i ca n't understand why people throw litter .
in a city full of possibilities i got a few jobs just to survive , then decided it was my vocation to become a languages teacher .

there are more than seven million stories in london and i am lucky to hear some of them as i work in a school with 1,200 students .
they teach me their values , points of view and expectations .
i use my own experience of learning english to put myself in their shoes and try to understand their difficulties , needs and frustrations .
they are very , very demanding and do not hesitate to tell me ' this activity is boring , that 's cool , let us work at our pace ' .
i 'll be happy if they understand how useful spanish or french can be .
' teaching challenge ' the press only want to talk about failure in schools , but i feel valued and there 's a culture of praise where i work .
they also recognised my teaching experience in spain , which would n't be the case for a teacher from the uk wanting to work there .
one problem with teaching is i am finding it difficult to get a place of my own .
after four years in my school and sharing flats around london i am desperate to buy my own place , but being single on a teacher 's salary means my aspirations are reduced to the size of a shoebox .

the losses will not include earnings from the company 's financing arm , chief financial officer hans-dieter poetsch said at the detroit motor show .
volkswagen has suffered as demand declined , the euro surged against the dollar and it cut jobs in brazil .
still , mr poetsch said total company profit will climb in 2004 , helped in part by the introduction of new models .
slowing growth mr poetsch said the company " will be slightly negative in 2003 " and forecast a similar outcome over the next 12 months .
carmakers have had a difficult couple of years as slowing economic growth and a slump in the stock market have dented demand .
many of the companies are trying to tempt consumers with interest-free loans , further hitting their profitability .
with increasing evidence of a global economic rebound and surging stock markets , many analysts are predicting better times ahead .
volkswagen 's domestic demand seems to be reviving , meanwhile , with chief executive bernd pischetsrieder saying he expects the german car market to reverse a four year decline and also pick up in 2004 .
