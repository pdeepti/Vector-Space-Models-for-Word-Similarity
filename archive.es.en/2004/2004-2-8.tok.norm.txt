hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .
u.s. discourages intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow but at the meeting , u.s. treasury secretary john snow -lrb- photo -rrb- sought to play down the current exchange rates .

" but the relative values of currencies are best established in open competitive currency markets .
nobody can devalue their way to prosperity . "
instead , he said the g7 should focus on further stimulating the global economy .
" we have a growth deficit , " he said .
the finance ministers and central bank leaders from the u.s. , canada , germany , france , great britain , italy and japan all signaled that the economic prospects are steadily improving around the world , but there is still much work to be done .
in europe , eichel said , it is crucial that countries take on additional reform measures , like german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " plan , which seeks to implement major structural reforms .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .

" we have a growth deficit , " he said .
the finance ministers and central bank leaders from the u.s. , canada , germany , france , great britain , italy and japan all signaled that the economic prospects are steadily improving around the world , but there is still much work to be done .
in europe , eichel said , it is crucial that countries take on additional reform measures , like german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " plan , which seeks to implement major structural reforms .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.02.2004 hungary mulls future of nuclear energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once hungary 's pride : the paks nuclear power plant .
hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .
the czech republic and slovakia are receiving particular scrutiny .

the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .

the finance ministers and central bank leaders from the u.s. , canada , germany , france , great britain , italy and japan all signaled that the economic prospects are steadily improving around the world , but there is still much work to be done .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .

" but the relative values of currencies are best established in open competitive currency markets .

instead , he said the g7 should focus on further stimulating the global economy .
" we have a growth deficit , " he said .
the finance ministers and central bank leaders from the u.s. , canada , germany , france , great britain , italy and japan all signaled that the economic prospects are steadily improving around the world , but there is still much work to be done .
in europe , eichel said , it is crucial that countries take on additional reform measures , like german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " plan , which seeks to implement major structural reforms .

things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .
u.s. discourages intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow but at the meeting , u.s. treasury secretary john snow -lrb- photo -rrb- sought to play down the current exchange rates .
" a strong dollar is in our national interest , " snow said .
" but the relative values of currencies are best established in open competitive currency markets .
nobody can devalue their way to prosperity . "
instead , he said the g7 should focus on further stimulating the global economy .
" we have a growth deficit , " he said .
the finance ministers and central bank leaders from the u.s. , canada , germany , france , great britain , italy and japan all signaled that the economic prospects are steadily improving around the world , but there is still much work to be done .
in europe , eichel said , it is crucial that countries take on additional reform measures , like german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " plan , which seeks to implement major structural reforms .
though the german economy is currently showing signs of growth , additional reforms are needed to keep the positive momentum , the government has argued .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 08.02.2004 g7 ministers meet to halt dollar ’ s fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance ministers around the world would like to see parity between the dollar and euro .
at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .
u.s. discourages intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow but at the meeting , u.s. treasury secretary john snow -lrb- photo -rrb- sought to play down the current exchange rates .
" a strong dollar is in our national interest , " snow said .
" but the relative values of currencies are best established in open competitive currency markets .
nobody can devalue their way to prosperity . "
instead , he said the g7 should focus on further stimulating the global economy .
" we have a growth deficit , " he said .
the finance ministers and central bank leaders from the u.s. , canada , germany , france , great britain , italy and japan all signaled that the economic prospects are steadily improving around the world , but there is still much work to be done .
in europe , eichel said , it is crucial that countries take on additional reform measures , like german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " plan , which seeks to implement major structural reforms .
though the german economy is currently showing signs of growth , additional reforms are needed to keep the positive momentum , the government has argued .
" agenda 2010 has played a large and positive role , " eichel said . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .
u.s. discourages intervention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow but at the meeting , u.s. treasury secretary john snow -lrb- photo -rrb- sought to play down the current exchange rates .
" a strong dollar is in our national interest , " snow said .
" but the relative values of currencies are best established in open competitive currency markets .
nobody can devalue their way to prosperity . "
instead , he said the g7 should focus on further stimulating the global economy .
" we have a growth deficit , " he said .
the finance ministers and central bank leaders from the u.s. , canada , germany , france , great britain , italy and japan all signaled that the economic prospects are steadily improving around the world , but there is still much work to be done .
in europe , eichel said , it is crucial that countries take on additional reform measures , like german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s " agenda 2010 " plan , which seeks to implement major structural reforms .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .
it ’ s caused some hungarians to start thinking about their country ’ s reliance on nuclear energy . plant is safe , nuclear energy supporters say but proponents of the technology said they still trust the system .
“ you don ’ t have to worry , ” said istvan vidovsky , deputy director of the hungarian center for nuclear research .
“ our nuclear plants are as safe as those in western europe or north america .
since 1990 , we have tried hard to improve safety at nuclear plants . ” that ’ s another reason why last year ’ s incident dealt such a blow to hungary ’ s nuclear industry .
unlike reactors in lithuania , for example , eu experts had given the hungarian plant their seal of approval – prior to the rod rupture , that is . now , opponents of nuclear energy are having a field day .
they consider the paks plant to be a reactor full of risks with serious construction faults , since it neither has a protective coat to prevent radioactive material from escaping nor a reliable cooling system . “ the paks plant is an only russian power plant , ” said csaki of greenpeace .
“ that ’ s why we ’ re worried whether it can keep working or not . ” mixed feelings about eu position hungary ’ s energy club , which promotes the use of alternative energies , asked the eu commission to comment on the incident .
months later , the group received a reply that didn ’ t say much : disappointing , but not surprising to group members , since brussels has been pushing to include the use of nuclear energy in the eu ’ s proposed constitution . environmentalist ada amon still believes eu membership will improve nuclear safety in her country .
“ i hope that the eu will prioritize safety much more than the hungarian government and that it will also pressure our government to place more emphasis on safety , ” she said . she added that she ’ s concerned about the plant ’ s workers and management as well .
“ financial profits top or at least topped the list of priorities , ” amon said . it ’ s still unclear when the ruptured rods will be retrieved from the reactor , but it definitely will be long after hungary joins the eu in may – an expensive power outage that costs € 200,000 -lrb- $ 253,000 -rrb- per day . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czechs and slovaks struggle with nuclear legacy when eight central and eastern european countries join the european union in may , they will bring a number of problematic nuclear reactors with them .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .
one possibility , though shunned by the americans , is that europe could buy up dollars in an effort to shore up the currency 's exchange rate .

at a weekend meeting of the g7 , finance ministers of the world ’ s seven most-important industrial nations issued a statement calling for more solid exchange rates – the strongest move yet to stop the plummeting dollar . gathered in boca raton , florida , the ministers on saturday said they were optimistic about the worldwide economic recovery taking shape .
german finance minister hans eichel said he believed financial markets would take note of the ministers ’ unanimous opinions .
without directly mentioning the dollar , the ministers said the recent major fluctuations of exchange rates were undesired .
european politicians had urged the drafting of a position that would help slow the rapid climb of the euro , europe ’ s common currency .
they fear longterm weakness of the dollar could delay growth of the european market by reducing the number of exports to the united states , europe 's biggest trading partner .
major swings ‘ undesired ’ " excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates are undesirable for economic growth , " the statement read .
" we emphasize that more flexibility in exchange rates is desirable for major countries or economic areas that lack such flexibility to promote smooth and widespread adjustments in the financial system , based on market conditions . "
the statement added that the countries would closely observer the currency markets and cooperate as appropriate .
" no further statement is necessary , " said eichel .
" the fact that we ’ re unified means a lot , and the financial markets will recognize that . "
the formulation marked a victory for the europeans , who have been concerned about damage to the export market as a direct result of the dollar ’ s weakness .
during the past two years , the dollar has lost about 29 percent of its value .
it also served as the strongest indication yet that europe may be close to intervening to stop the drop of the dollar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 08.02.2004 hungary mulls future of nuclear energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once hungary 's pride : the paks nuclear power plant .
hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .

hungary has been a proponent of nuclear energy for decades .
but a radioactive leak at the country ’ s only nuclear power plant last year has provoked discussion about the technology ’ s safety . half a dozen hungarians were present when the world ’ s first nuclear power plant began its test run in chicago in 1942 .
the country looks at its nuclear physicists with huge respect and there had never been a debate about the technology ’ s pros and cons .
things changed after april 10 , 2003 , when fuel rods at hungary ’ s only nuclear power plant ruptured during a routine cleaning and radioactive material was released into the atmosphere .
hungarians , thousands of whom had visited the plant every year since its opening in 1982 , began worrying about their safety .
shortly before hungary will join the european union , politicians and the nuclear lobby aren ’ t happy as the incident might endanger plans to keep the plant working for another 20 years . situated near the town paks on the river danube , about 130 kilometers -lrb- 81 miles -rrb- downstream from budapest , the plant generated 2,000 megawatts , 40 percent of hungary ’ s power supply , making it one of the most high-performing in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plant 's interior that ’ s no longer the case as one of the reactors was shut off after last year ’ s incident : as the franco-german maintenance company framatome anp was cleaning 30 fuel rods , the cooling system failed , causing the rods to overheat and rupture .
the leak caused levels of radioactivity to rise as far away as budapest . “ our instruments measured levels 10 percent higher than normal , ” said zoltan szatmary , a professor at the research reactor at budapest ’ s technical university .
“ but then we analyzed it and realized that only one or two percent of the rise could be attributed to the incident .
no one was hurt , no limits were exceeded . ” environmentalists criticize official reaction some members of the environmental activist group greenpeace got hurt , however , as they chained themselves to the plant ’ s gates in protest .
the reactor ’ s management didn ’ t like that and got rough with the protesters : contusions , bruises , a broken finger and a dislodged arm were the result . “ the police showed up quickly and arrested everyone , ” said roland csaki , a hungarian greenpeace activist .
“ they were brutal , not at all like they should behave towards demonstrators in a democratic country . ” csaki also criticized the plant management ’ s refusal to release information about the incident .
“ the population didn ’ t find out for seven days , ” he said .
“ it ’ s like the old method , similar to how hungarian and russian authorities handled chernobyl . ” only later officials raised the incident to level three , a “ serious incident ” on the seven-level international nuclear event scale -lrb- ines -rrb- .

environmental pressure group greenpeace said the dead dolphins were spotted near two sets of pair trawlers off plymouth .
the deaths are the latest in the hundreds catalogued off south west shores over the last couple of years .
mps have called on the government to take action to stop the daily slaughter of the creatures .
observers on the greenpeace vessel esperanza pinpointed the dead creatures 20 miles off the coast of plymouth .
pair trawler crews deny they are responsible for the deaths the dolphins displayed injuries , such as broken beaks and damaged dorsal fins and flippers , consistent with being caught in large fishing nets , says greenpeace .
a piece of net was found close to the still-bleeding animals , which were spotted just after 1100 gmt on saturday .
