bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .

as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job . most diplomats would consider baghdad more of a hardship post .
but not bernd erbel .
for him , being the new german ambassador to iraq is the highlight of his diplomatic career spanning almost three decades .
the 56-year-old erbel has been fascinated by the orient since his childhood .
already as a 16-year-old student in karlsruhe , he traveled through egypt .
since then , the arab world has not relinquished its hold on him .
the former charge d 'affaires presented his credentials to iraq ’ s interim president ghazi al-yawar earlier this week .
erbel is the first official german representative in baghdad since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime last year .
berlin deliberately waited to select and send a new diplomat until the interim iraqi government took power on june 28 .
foreign posts erbel studied law and middle eastern history in munich and is fluent in arabic .
he joined the diplomatic service in 1975 , and was sent to his first foreign post two years later : the german embassy in beirut .
there , he met his wife , may , a lebanese christian .
they have two sons and a daughter , who all speak fluent arabic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to iraq , bernd erbel , has had a lifetime fascination with the arab world .
erbel ’ s later posts all led to the arab world .
initially , he represented the german embassy in sanaa , yemen .

but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .

" right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .

that is a barrier , he said , that will not likely be crossed . new intensity , new forms ? however , that could depend on the future direction of the protest movement , which is still going strong .
much hangs on the nature of the demonstrations , whether they remain unified or are split among different factions .
the role of the unions and their calls to action will also determine how the protests develop . peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said the population 's anger could increase as politicians refuse to soften any more of the reform 's harder edges . " the level of aggression is very high right now and it 's likely to get worse with time , " he told dw-world .

" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger . " right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .
" in january , when one million people lose their benefits , then it could really take off . " high social tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the labor market and welfare changes being introduced by schröder 's government , named hartz iv after their author , volkswagen 's personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , are the biggest social reforms in germany 's post-war history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration against the hartz iv reforms in the eastern german town of brandenburg the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . the chairman of germany 's police union , konrad freiberg , expressed fears that the social tension caused by the reforms and protests could lead to an upsurge in violence , especially against employees of job centers and welfare offices . " in general we 're seeing more violence in our society and the police are being called out more and more , " he told the express newspaper in cologne .
" they 're especially called to welfare offices because employees there are increasingly being threatened and insulted , or violence is being used . " rising tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job center violence in welfare and job centers has been on the increase over the several years , as the unemployed vent their frustration at being unable to find work or seeing the benefits reduced . " we 're had this problem for several years , " kerstin bauer of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg welfare office told dw-world .
" personally i worry about an upturn in the violence because of the heated discussion going on now about the reforms .
some people seem to think violence is a legitimate means to express their dissatisfaction . " in the state of thuringia , the job center in the town of nordhauser has hired five private security guards to make rounds and quell potential trouble .
in the district of neukölln in berlin , five youths recently took their frustrations out on a desk officer , beating him severely . " i anticipate that these kind of excesses are just going to increase because of hartz iv , " achim berger , deputy head of the center 's workers ' council , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . the federal labor office , located in nuremberg , is watching the developments in the debate over hartz iv closely and trying to prepare in case the fallout becomes more serious , according to spokeswoman ilone mierschen .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .
leverkusen , however , may have another champions league adventure on their hands if they continue to play like this . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough times ahead for germans in champions league werder bremen , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen discovered their european champions league fate on thursday .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .
leverkusen , however , may have another champions league adventure on their hands if they continue to play like this . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough times ahead for germans in champions league werder bremen , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen discovered their european champions league fate on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.08.2004 reform anger could turn violent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been peaceful but the social tension has some worried a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior . during a recent trip by chancellor gerhard schröder to the eastern town of wittenberge , his bodyguards had to suddenly scramble to protect the german leader from eggs thrown at him by demonstrators protesting his welfare reforms .
" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger . " right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .
" in january , when one million people lose their benefits , then it could really take off . " high social tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the labor market and welfare changes being introduced by schröder 's government , named hartz iv after their author , volkswagen 's personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , are the biggest social reforms in germany 's post-war history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration against the hartz iv reforms in the eastern german town of brandenburg the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . the chairman of germany 's police union , konrad freiberg , expressed fears that the social tension caused by the reforms and protests could lead to an upsurge in violence , especially against employees of job centers and welfare offices . " in general we 're seeing more violence in our society and the police are being called out more and more , " he told the express newspaper in cologne .
" they 're especially called to welfare offices because employees there are increasingly being threatened and insulted , or violence is being used . " rising tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job center violence in welfare and job centers has been on the increase over the several years , as the unemployed vent their frustration at being unable to find work or seeing the benefits reduced . " we 're had this problem for several years , " kerstin bauer of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg welfare office told dw-world .
" personally i worry about an upturn in the violence because of the heated discussion going on now about the reforms .
some people seem to think violence is a legitimate means to express their dissatisfaction . " in the state of thuringia , the job center in the town of nordhauser has hired five private security guards to make rounds and quell potential trouble .
in the district of neukölln in berlin , five youths recently took their frustrations out on a desk officer , beating him severely . " i anticipate that these kind of excesses are just going to increase because of hartz iv , " achim berger , deputy head of the center 's workers ' council , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . the federal labor office , located in nuremberg , is watching the developments in the debate over hartz iv closely and trying to prepare in case the fallout becomes more serious , according to spokeswoman ilone mierschen . " our security plans have been reviewed or are being reviewed so that if we do see an increase in violent incidents , we will be ready for them , " she told dw-world . irritated , but mostly calm however , she and some others insist it is too early to talk about the reforms sparking a general trend toward more violent behavior . " i think the violent incidents we have seen recently are exceptions , " dr. jürgen mittag , a social researcher at the university of bochum , told dw-world .
" it 's true that some tempers are at a all-time high , but we should n't engage in generalizations about the whole of society . " he agrees that the uncertainty among many about their future has led to unusual levels of frustration , anger and feelings of powerlessness , but does not see it spiralling out of control .
that is a barrier , he said , that will not likely be crossed . new intensity , new forms ? however , that could depend on the future direction of the protest movement , which is still going strong .
much hangs on the nature of the demonstrations , whether they remain unified or are split among different factions .
the role of the unions and their calls to action will also determine how the protests develop . peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said the population 's anger could increase as politicians refuse to soften any more of the reform 's harder edges . " the level of aggression is very high right now and it 's likely to get worse with time , " he told dw-world .
he said that does not expressly mean more violence , but protests could take a turn . " i think the traditional protest forms are going to expand and we 're going to see more civil disobedience actions , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job . most diplomats would consider baghdad more of a hardship post .
but not bernd erbel .
for him , being the new german ambassador to iraq is the highlight of his diplomatic career spanning almost three decades .

already as a 16-year-old student in karlsruhe , he traveled through egypt .
since then , the arab world has not relinquished its hold on him .
the former charge d 'affaires presented his credentials to iraq ’ s interim president ghazi al-yawar earlier this week .
erbel is the first official german representative in baghdad since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime last year .
berlin deliberately waited to select and send a new diplomat until the interim iraqi government took power on june 28 .
foreign posts erbel studied law and middle eastern history in munich and is fluent in arabic .
he joined the diplomatic service in 1975 , and was sent to his first foreign post two years later : the german embassy in beirut .
there , he met his wife , may , a lebanese christian .
they have two sons and a daughter , who all speak fluent arabic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to iraq , bernd erbel , has had a lifetime fascination with the arab world .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said .

ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.08.2004 reform anger could turn violent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been peaceful but the social tension has some worried a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior . during a recent trip by chancellor gerhard schröder to the eastern town of wittenberge , his bodyguards had to suddenly scramble to protect the german leader from eggs thrown at him by demonstrators protesting his welfare reforms .
" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger . " right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .
" in january , when one million people lose their benefits , then it could really take off . " high social tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the labor market and welfare changes being introduced by schröder 's government , named hartz iv after their author , volkswagen 's personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , are the biggest social reforms in germany 's post-war history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration against the hartz iv reforms in the eastern german town of brandenburg the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . the chairman of germany 's police union , konrad freiberg , expressed fears that the social tension caused by the reforms and protests could lead to an upsurge in violence , especially against employees of job centers and welfare offices . " in general we 're seeing more violence in our society and the police are being called out more and more , " he told the express newspaper in cologne .
" they 're especially called to welfare offices because employees there are increasingly being threatened and insulted , or violence is being used . " rising tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job center violence in welfare and job centers has been on the increase over the several years , as the unemployed vent their frustration at being unable to find work or seeing the benefits reduced . " we 're had this problem for several years , " kerstin bauer of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg welfare office told dw-world .
" personally i worry about an upturn in the violence because of the heated discussion going on now about the reforms .
some people seem to think violence is a legitimate means to express their dissatisfaction . " in the state of thuringia , the job center in the town of nordhauser has hired five private security guards to make rounds and quell potential trouble .
in the district of neukölln in berlin , five youths recently took their frustrations out on a desk officer , beating him severely . " i anticipate that these kind of excesses are just going to increase because of hartz iv , " achim berger , deputy head of the center 's workers ' council , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . the federal labor office , located in nuremberg , is watching the developments in the debate over hartz iv closely and trying to prepare in case the fallout becomes more serious , according to spokeswoman ilone mierschen . " our security plans have been reviewed or are being reviewed so that if we do see an increase in violent incidents , we will be ready for them , " she told dw-world . irritated , but mostly calm however , she and some others insist it is too early to talk about the reforms sparking a general trend toward more violent behavior . " i think the violent incidents we have seen recently are exceptions , " dr. jürgen mittag , a social researcher at the university of bochum , told dw-world .
" it 's true that some tempers are at a all-time high , but we should n't engage in generalizations about the whole of society . " he agrees that the uncertainty among many about their future has led to unusual levels of frustration , anger and feelings of powerlessness , but does not see it spiralling out of control .
that is a barrier , he said , that will not likely be crossed . new intensity , new forms ? however , that could depend on the future direction of the protest movement , which is still going strong .
much hangs on the nature of the demonstrations , whether they remain unified or are split among different factions .
the role of the unions and their calls to action will also determine how the protests develop . peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said the population 's anger could increase as politicians refuse to soften any more of the reform 's harder edges . " the level of aggression is very high right now and it 's likely to get worse with time , " he told dw-world .
he said that does not expressly mean more violence , but protests could take a turn .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .

since then , the arab world has not relinquished its hold on him .
the former charge d 'affaires presented his credentials to iraq ’ s interim president ghazi al-yawar earlier this week .

as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job . most diplomats would consider baghdad more of a hardship post .
but not bernd erbel .
for him , being the new german ambassador to iraq is the highlight of his diplomatic career spanning almost three decades .
the 56-year-old erbel has been fascinated by the orient since his childhood .
already as a 16-year-old student in karlsruhe , he traveled through egypt .
since then , the arab world has not relinquished its hold on him .
the former charge d 'affaires presented his credentials to iraq ’ s interim president ghazi al-yawar earlier this week .
erbel is the first official german representative in baghdad since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime last year .
berlin deliberately waited to select and send a new diplomat until the interim iraqi government took power on june 28 .
foreign posts erbel studied law and middle eastern history in munich and is fluent in arabic .
he joined the diplomatic service in 1975 , and was sent to his first foreign post two years later : the german embassy in beirut .
there , he met his wife , may , a lebanese christian .
they have two sons and a daughter , who all speak fluent arabic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to iraq , bernd erbel , has had a lifetime fascination with the arab world .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger . " right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .
" in january , when one million people lose their benefits , then it could really take off . " high social tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the labor market and welfare changes being introduced by schröder 's government , named hartz iv after their author , volkswagen 's personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , are the biggest social reforms in germany 's post-war history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration against the hartz iv reforms in the eastern german town of brandenburg the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . the chairman of germany 's police union , konrad freiberg , expressed fears that the social tension caused by the reforms and protests could lead to an upsurge in violence , especially against employees of job centers and welfare offices . " in general we 're seeing more violence in our society and the police are being called out more and more , " he told the express newspaper in cologne .
" they 're especially called to welfare offices because employees there are increasingly being threatened and insulted , or violence is being used . " rising tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job center violence in welfare and job centers has been on the increase over the several years , as the unemployed vent their frustration at being unable to find work or seeing the benefits reduced . " we 're had this problem for several years , " kerstin bauer of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg welfare office told dw-world .
" personally i worry about an upturn in the violence because of the heated discussion going on now about the reforms .
some people seem to think violence is a legitimate means to express their dissatisfaction . " in the state of thuringia , the job center in the town of nordhauser has hired five private security guards to make rounds and quell potential trouble .
in the district of neukölln in berlin , five youths recently took their frustrations out on a desk officer , beating him severely . " i anticipate that these kind of excesses are just going to increase because of hartz iv , " achim berger , deputy head of the center 's workers ' council , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . the federal labor office , located in nuremberg , is watching the developments in the debate over hartz iv closely and trying to prepare in case the fallout becomes more serious , according to spokeswoman ilone mierschen . " our security plans have been reviewed or are being reviewed so that if we do see an increase in violent incidents , we will be ready for them , " she told dw-world . irritated , but mostly calm however , she and some others insist it is too early to talk about the reforms sparking a general trend toward more violent behavior . " i think the violent incidents we have seen recently are exceptions , " dr. jürgen mittag , a social researcher at the university of bochum , told dw-world .
" it 's true that some tempers are at a all-time high , but we should n't engage in generalizations about the whole of society . " he agrees that the uncertainty among many about their future has led to unusual levels of frustration , anger and feelings of powerlessness , but does not see it spiralling out of control .
that is a barrier , he said , that will not likely be crossed . new intensity , new forms ? however , that could depend on the future direction of the protest movement , which is still going strong .
much hangs on the nature of the demonstrations , whether they remain unified or are split among different factions .
the role of the unions and their calls to action will also determine how the protests develop . peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said the population 's anger could increase as politicians refuse to soften any more of the reform 's harder edges . " the level of aggression is very high right now and it 's likely to get worse with time , " he told dw-world .
he said that does not expressly mean more violence , but protests could take a turn . " i think the traditional protest forms are going to expand and we 're going to see more civil disobedience actions , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .

leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .
leverkusen , however , may have another champions league adventure on their hands if they continue to play like this . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough times ahead for germans in champions league werder bremen , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen discovered their european champions league fate on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.08.2004 japan-bound zeppelin forced to return to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zeppelin " lake constance " had its historic debut cut short a german-built zeppelin headed for japan is returning to southern germany after being refused permission to cross over russian territory .
bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job . most diplomats would consider baghdad more of a hardship post .
but not bernd erbel .
for him , being the new german ambassador to iraq is the highlight of his diplomatic career spanning almost three decades .
the 56-year-old erbel has been fascinated by the orient since his childhood .
already as a 16-year-old student in karlsruhe , he traveled through egypt .
since then , the arab world has not relinquished its hold on him .
the former charge d 'affaires presented his credentials to iraq ’ s interim president ghazi al-yawar earlier this week .
erbel is the first official german representative in baghdad since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime last year .
berlin deliberately waited to select and send a new diplomat until the interim iraqi government took power on june 28 .
foreign posts erbel studied law and middle eastern history in munich and is fluent in arabic .
he joined the diplomatic service in 1975 , and was sent to his first foreign post two years later : the german embassy in beirut .
there , he met his wife , may , a lebanese christian .
they have two sons and a daughter , who all speak fluent arabic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to iraq , bernd erbel , has had a lifetime fascination with the arab world .
erbel ’ s later posts all led to the arab world .
initially , he represented the german embassy in sanaa , yemen .
later , he functioned as a german diplomat in the saudi arabian capital riyadh , as well as in cairo , egypt .
between his foreign posts , he worked for several years for the middle eastern desk of germany ’ s foreign ministry in bonn .
a great challenge berlin and baghdad have had diplomatic relations since 1974 .
the last german ambassador left iraq in 1991 at the time of the first gulf war .
germany reopened a mission with a charge d 'affaires in 1999 , but closed it down at the time of the 2003 us-led invasion .
although erbel ’ s title as ambassador has just become official , he has already been in baghdad since june in order to meet all the necessary preparations for his new task and the re-opening of the german embassy there .
for him , the post in baghdad is a step up .
it is his first post as a full ambassador .
it is a difficult task and a great challenge at the same time , both on a diplomatic level , as well as in security terms .
but erbel was already able to collect experience in times of civil unrest during his post in beirut and will know when to lay low when the bullets are flying .
his well-known sense of humor and easy-going personality will also certainly help him deal with his quite stressful job environment .
in baghdad , the embassy and his residence are based in baghdad 's upscale mansour neighborhood , barricaded behind sand bags .
these security measures are vital in the current situation .
however , erbel with his experience in arab matters and language skills should still be in the position to understand the mentality of the iraqi people and politicians . fares youwakim -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule paul bremer , the us administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .

as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job . most diplomats would consider baghdad more of a hardship post .
but not bernd erbel .
for him , being the new german ambassador to iraq is the highlight of his diplomatic career spanning almost three decades .
the 56-year-old erbel has been fascinated by the orient since his childhood .
already as a 16-year-old student in karlsruhe , he traveled through egypt .
since then , the arab world has not relinquished its hold on him .
the former charge d 'affaires presented his credentials to iraq ’ s interim president ghazi al-yawar earlier this week .
erbel is the first official german representative in baghdad since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime last year .
berlin deliberately waited to select and send a new diplomat until the interim iraqi government took power on june 28 .
foreign posts erbel studied law and middle eastern history in munich and is fluent in arabic .
he joined the diplomatic service in 1975 , and was sent to his first foreign post two years later : the german embassy in beirut .
there , he met his wife , may , a lebanese christian .
they have two sons and a daughter , who all speak fluent arabic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to iraq , bernd erbel , has had a lifetime fascination with the arab world .
erbel ’ s later posts all led to the arab world .
initially , he represented the german embassy in sanaa , yemen .
later , he functioned as a german diplomat in the saudi arabian capital riyadh , as well as in cairo , egypt .
between his foreign posts , he worked for several years for the middle eastern desk of germany ’ s foreign ministry in bonn .
a great challenge berlin and baghdad have had diplomatic relations since 1974 .
the last german ambassador left iraq in 1991 at the time of the first gulf war .
germany reopened a mission with a charge d 'affaires in 1999 , but closed it down at the time of the 2003 us-led invasion .
although erbel ’ s title as ambassador has just become official , he has already been in baghdad since june in order to meet all the necessary preparations for his new task and the re-opening of the german embassy there .
for him , the post in baghdad is a step up .
it is his first post as a full ambassador .
it is a difficult task and a great challenge at the same time , both on a diplomatic level , as well as in security terms .
but erbel was already able to collect experience in times of civil unrest during his post in beirut and will know when to lay low when the bullets are flying .
his well-known sense of humor and easy-going personality will also certainly help him deal with his quite stressful job environment .
in baghdad , the embassy and his residence are based in baghdad 's upscale mansour neighborhood , barricaded behind sand bags .
these security measures are vital in the current situation .
however , erbel with his experience in arab matters and language skills should still be in the position to understand the mentality of the iraqi people and politicians . fares youwakim -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule paul bremer , the us administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger .

" in general we 're seeing more violence in our society and the police are being called out more and more , " he told the express newspaper in cologne .

some people seem to think violence is a legitimate means to express their dissatisfaction . " in the state of thuringia , the job center in the town of nordhauser has hired five private security guards to make rounds and quell potential trouble .
in the district of neukölln in berlin , five youths recently took their frustrations out on a desk officer , beating him severely . " i anticipate that these kind of excesses are just going to increase because of hartz iv , " achim berger , deputy head of the center 's workers ' council , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . the federal labor office , located in nuremberg , is watching the developments in the debate over hartz iv closely and trying to prepare in case the fallout becomes more serious , according to spokeswoman ilone mierschen .

after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .
leverkusen , however , may have another champions league adventure on their hands if they continue to play like this . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough times ahead for germans in champions league werder bremen , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen discovered their european champions league fate on thursday .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.08.2004 reform anger could turn violent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been peaceful but the social tension has some worried a series of violent incidents related to anger at the german government 's welfare reforms have some worried that widespread discontent among the populace could lead a surge in aggressive and illegal behavior . during a recent trip by chancellor gerhard schröder to the eastern town of wittenberge , his bodyguards had to suddenly scramble to protect the german leader from eggs thrown at him by demonstrators protesting his welfare reforms .
" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger . " right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .
" in january , when one million people lose their benefits , then it could really take off . " high social tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the labor market and welfare changes being introduced by schröder 's government , named hartz iv after their author , volkswagen 's personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , are the biggest social reforms in germany 's post-war history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration against the hartz iv reforms in the eastern german town of brandenburg the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . the chairman of germany 's police union , konrad freiberg , expressed fears that the social tension caused by the reforms and protests could lead to an upsurge in violence , especially against employees of job centers and welfare offices . " in general we 're seeing more violence in our society and the police are being called out more and more , " he told the express newspaper in cologne .
" they 're especially called to welfare offices because employees there are increasingly being threatened and insulted , or violence is being used . " rising tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job center violence in welfare and job centers has been on the increase over the several years , as the unemployed vent their frustration at being unable to find work or seeing the benefits reduced . " we 're had this problem for several years , " kerstin bauer of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg welfare office told dw-world .
" personally i worry about an upturn in the violence because of the heated discussion going on now about the reforms .
some people seem to think violence is a legitimate means to express their dissatisfaction . " in the state of thuringia , the job center in the town of nordhauser has hired five private security guards to make rounds and quell potential trouble .
in the district of neukölln in berlin , five youths recently took their frustrations out on a desk officer , beating him severely . " i anticipate that these kind of excesses are just going to increase because of hartz iv , " achim berger , deputy head of the center 's workers ' council , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . the federal labor office , located in nuremberg , is watching the developments in the debate over hartz iv closely and trying to prepare in case the fallout becomes more serious , according to spokeswoman ilone mierschen . " our security plans have been reviewed or are being reviewed so that if we do see an increase in violent incidents , we will be ready for them , " she told dw-world . irritated , but mostly calm however , she and some others insist it is too early to talk about the reforms sparking a general trend toward more violent behavior . " i think the violent incidents we have seen recently are exceptions , " dr. jürgen mittag , a social researcher at the university of bochum , told dw-world .
" it 's true that some tempers are at a all-time high , but we should n't engage in generalizations about the whole of society . " he agrees that the uncertainty among many about their future has led to unusual levels of frustration , anger and feelings of powerlessness , but does not see it spiralling out of control .
that is a barrier , he said , that will not likely be crossed . new intensity , new forms ? however , that could depend on the future direction of the protest movement , which is still going strong .
much hangs on the nature of the demonstrations , whether they remain unified or are split among different factions .
the role of the unions and their calls to action will also determine how the protests develop . peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said the population 's anger could increase as politicians refuse to soften any more of the reform 's harder edges . " the level of aggression is very high right now and it 's likely to get worse with time , " he told dw-world .
he said that does not expressly mean more violence , but protests could take a turn . " i think the traditional protest forms are going to expand and we 're going to see more civil disobedience actions , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job . most diplomats would consider baghdad more of a hardship post .
but not bernd erbel .
for him , being the new german ambassador to iraq is the highlight of his diplomatic career spanning almost three decades .
the 56-year-old erbel has been fascinated by the orient since his childhood .
already as a 16-year-old student in karlsruhe , he traveled through egypt .
since then , the arab world has not relinquished its hold on him .
the former charge d 'affaires presented his credentials to iraq ’ s interim president ghazi al-yawar earlier this week .
erbel is the first official german representative in baghdad since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime last year .
berlin deliberately waited to select and send a new diplomat until the interim iraqi government took power on june 28 .
foreign posts erbel studied law and middle eastern history in munich and is fluent in arabic .
he joined the diplomatic service in 1975 , and was sent to his first foreign post two years later : the german embassy in beirut .
there , he met his wife , may , a lebanese christian .
they have two sons and a daughter , who all speak fluent arabic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to iraq , bernd erbel , has had a lifetime fascination with the arab world .
erbel ’ s later posts all led to the arab world .
initially , he represented the german embassy in sanaa , yemen .
later , he functioned as a german diplomat in the saudi arabian capital riyadh , as well as in cairo , egypt .
between his foreign posts , he worked for several years for the middle eastern desk of germany ’ s foreign ministry in bonn .
a great challenge berlin and baghdad have had diplomatic relations since 1974 .
the last german ambassador left iraq in 1991 at the time of the first gulf war .
germany reopened a mission with a charge d 'affaires in 1999 , but closed it down at the time of the 2003 us-led invasion .
although erbel ’ s title as ambassador has just become official , he has already been in baghdad since june in order to meet all the necessary preparations for his new task and the re-opening of the german embassy there .
for him , the post in baghdad is a step up .
it is his first post as a full ambassador .
it is a difficult task and a great challenge at the same time , both on a diplomatic level , as well as in security terms .
but erbel was already able to collect experience in times of civil unrest during his post in beirut and will know when to lay low when the bullets are flying .
his well-known sense of humor and easy-going personality will also certainly help him deal with his quite stressful job environment .
in baghdad , the embassy and his residence are based in baghdad 's upscale mansour neighborhood , barricaded behind sand bags .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

as his background shows , there are few better suited for the job . most diplomats would consider baghdad more of a hardship post .
but not bernd erbel .
for him , being the new german ambassador to iraq is the highlight of his diplomatic career spanning almost three decades .
the 56-year-old erbel has been fascinated by the orient since his childhood .
already as a 16-year-old student in karlsruhe , he traveled through egypt .
since then , the arab world has not relinquished its hold on him .
the former charge d 'affaires presented his credentials to iraq ’ s interim president ghazi al-yawar earlier this week .
erbel is the first official german representative in baghdad since the fall of saddam hussein ’ s regime last year .
berlin deliberately waited to select and send a new diplomat until the interim iraqi government took power on june 28 .
foreign posts erbel studied law and middle eastern history in munich and is fluent in arabic .
he joined the diplomatic service in 1975 , and was sent to his first foreign post two years later : the german embassy in beirut .
there , he met his wife , may , a lebanese christian .
they have two sons and a daughter , who all speak fluent arabic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ambassador to iraq , bernd erbel , has had a lifetime fascination with the arab world .
erbel ’ s later posts all led to the arab world .
initially , he represented the german embassy in sanaa , yemen .
later , he functioned as a german diplomat in the saudi arabian capital riyadh , as well as in cairo , egypt .
between his foreign posts , he worked for several years for the middle eastern desk of germany ’ s foreign ministry in bonn .
a great challenge berlin and baghdad have had diplomatic relations since 1974 .
the last german ambassador left iraq in 1991 at the time of the first gulf war .
germany reopened a mission with a charge d 'affaires in 1999 , but closed it down at the time of the 2003 us-led invasion .
although erbel ’ s title as ambassador has just become official , he has already been in baghdad since june in order to meet all the necessary preparations for his new task and the re-opening of the german embassy there .
for him , the post in baghdad is a step up .
it is his first post as a full ambassador .
it is a difficult task and a great challenge at the same time , both on a diplomatic level , as well as in security terms .
but erbel was already able to collect experience in times of civil unrest during his post in beirut and will know when to lay low when the bullets are flying .
his well-known sense of humor and easy-going personality will also certainly help him deal with his quite stressful job environment .
in baghdad , the embassy and his residence are based in baghdad 's upscale mansour neighborhood , barricaded behind sand bags .
these security measures are vital in the current situation .
however , erbel with his experience in arab matters and language skills should still be in the position to understand the mentality of the iraqi people and politicians . fares youwakim -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. restores iraqi sovereignty ahead of schedule paul bremer , the us administrator in iraq , formally passed the reins of power to the country 's new government before leaving for the u.s. the handover took place two days earlier than planned .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .

" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger . " right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .
" in january , when one million people lose their benefits , then it could really take off . " high social tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the labor market and welfare changes being introduced by schröder 's government , named hartz iv after their author , volkswagen 's personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , are the biggest social reforms in germany 's post-war history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration against the hartz iv reforms in the eastern german town of brandenburg the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . the chairman of germany 's police union , konrad freiberg , expressed fears that the social tension caused by the reforms and protests could lead to an upsurge in violence , especially against employees of job centers and welfare offices . " in general we 're seeing more violence in our society and the police are being called out more and more , " he told the express newspaper in cologne .
" they 're especially called to welfare offices because employees there are increasingly being threatened and insulted , or violence is being used . " rising tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job center violence in welfare and job centers has been on the increase over the several years , as the unemployed vent their frustration at being unable to find work or seeing the benefits reduced . " we 're had this problem for several years , " kerstin bauer of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg welfare office told dw-world .
" personally i worry about an upturn in the violence because of the heated discussion going on now about the reforms .
some people seem to think violence is a legitimate means to express their dissatisfaction . " in the state of thuringia , the job center in the town of nordhauser has hired five private security guards to make rounds and quell potential trouble .
in the district of neukölln in berlin , five youths recently took their frustrations out on a desk officer , beating him severely . " i anticipate that these kind of excesses are just going to increase because of hartz iv , " achim berger , deputy head of the center 's workers ' council , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . the federal labor office , located in nuremberg , is watching the developments in the debate over hartz iv closely and trying to prepare in case the fallout becomes more serious , according to spokeswoman ilone mierschen . " our security plans have been reviewed or are being reviewed so that if we do see an increase in violent incidents , we will be ready for them , " she told dw-world . irritated , but mostly calm however , she and some others insist it is too early to talk about the reforms sparking a general trend toward more violent behavior . " i think the violent incidents we have seen recently are exceptions , " dr. jürgen mittag , a social researcher at the university of bochum , told dw-world .
" it 's true that some tempers are at a all-time high , but we should n't engage in generalizations about the whole of society . " he agrees that the uncertainty among many about their future has led to unusual levels of frustration , anger and feelings of powerlessness , but does not see it spiralling out of control .
that is a barrier , he said , that will not likely be crossed . new intensity , new forms ? however , that could depend on the future direction of the protest movement , which is still going strong .
much hangs on the nature of the demonstrations , whether they remain unified or are split among different factions .
the role of the unions and their calls to action will also determine how the protests develop . peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said the population 's anger could increase as politicians refuse to soften any more of the reform 's harder edges . " the level of aggression is very high right now and it 's likely to get worse with time , " he told dw-world .
he said that does not expressly mean more violence , but protests could take a turn . " i think the traditional protest forms are going to expand and we 're going to see more civil disobedience actions , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .

" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger . " right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .

" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger . " right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .
" in january , when one million people lose their benefits , then it could really take off . " high social tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the labor market and welfare changes being introduced by schröder 's government , named hartz iv after their author , volkswagen 's personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , are the biggest social reforms in germany 's post-war history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration against the hartz iv reforms in the eastern german town of brandenburg the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . the chairman of germany 's police union , konrad freiberg , expressed fears that the social tension caused by the reforms and protests could lead to an upsurge in violence , especially against employees of job centers and welfare offices . " in general we 're seeing more violence in our society and the police are being called out more and more , " he told the express newspaper in cologne .
" they 're especially called to welfare offices because employees there are increasingly being threatened and insulted , or violence is being used . " rising tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job center violence in welfare and job centers has been on the increase over the several years , as the unemployed vent their frustration at being unable to find work or seeing the benefits reduced . " we 're had this problem for several years , " kerstin bauer of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg welfare office told dw-world .
" personally i worry about an upturn in the violence because of the heated discussion going on now about the reforms .
some people seem to think violence is a legitimate means to express their dissatisfaction . " in the state of thuringia , the job center in the town of nordhauser has hired five private security guards to make rounds and quell potential trouble .
in the district of neukölln in berlin , five youths recently took their frustrations out on a desk officer , beating him severely . " i anticipate that these kind of excesses are just going to increase because of hartz iv , " achim berger , deputy head of the center 's workers ' council , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . the federal labor office , located in nuremberg , is watching the developments in the debate over hartz iv closely and trying to prepare in case the fallout becomes more serious , according to spokeswoman ilone mierschen . " our security plans have been reviewed or are being reviewed so that if we do see an increase in violent incidents , we will be ready for them , " she told dw-world . irritated , but mostly calm however , she and some others insist it is too early to talk about the reforms sparking a general trend toward more violent behavior . " i think the violent incidents we have seen recently are exceptions , " dr. jürgen mittag , a social researcher at the university of bochum , told dw-world .
" it 's true that some tempers are at a all-time high , but we should n't engage in generalizations about the whole of society . " he agrees that the uncertainty among many about their future has led to unusual levels of frustration , anger and feelings of powerlessness , but does not see it spiralling out of control .
that is a barrier , he said , that will not likely be crossed . new intensity , new forms ? however , that could depend on the future direction of the protest movement , which is still going strong .
much hangs on the nature of the demonstrations , whether they remain unified or are split among different factions .
the role of the unions and their calls to action will also determine how the protests develop . peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said the population 's anger could increase as politicians refuse to soften any more of the reform 's harder edges . " the level of aggression is very high right now and it 's likely to get worse with time , " he told dw-world .
he said that does not expressly mean more violence , but protests could take a turn . " i think the traditional protest forms are going to expand and we 're going to see more civil disobedience actions , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .
and it takes a long time i think in russia and in other countries as well , " stäter said .
" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said . " but it also has one disadvantage - all the other existing airships are blimps , they do n't have an internal structure .
ours has an internal structure , a little bit equivalent to the old zeppelins and you can not disassemble this structure very rapidly and the blimp .
you take the helium and the gas and the air out and then you can pack it in several weeks into a container which you ca n't do with our airship , " he said . " so that means you can only bring our airship to the final destination by a fire flight . " the technicians from germany 's zeppelin luftshifftechnik corporation are now investigating other transport options including placing the inflated zeppelin on a cargo ship or flying it like a kite from a smaller boat . otherwise nippon airship corporation have said they will attempt to fly the zeppelin again next spring after securing authorization from russia . jennifer macey -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

bad weather and red tape cut stalled the historic flight . all the air has gone out of the zeppelin 's historic flight from germany to japan .
after being grounded at the finnish-russian border for five weeks waiting for authorization to enter russian airspace , the cigar-shaped 75-meter-long -lrb- 247-foot -rrb- airship , the first of a new generation which had intended to cross russia to japan last month , is now being sent back to the factory on lake constance in southern germany . japan 's nippon airship corporation -lrb- nac -rrb- had purchased the dirigible called " lake constance " from the german company in march for $ 11.7 million and wanted to fly the 12,000 kilometers from germany to its new home in japan . nac wants to use the helium-filled airship for sightseeing and advertising flights and hopes to feature the modern day zeppelin at the 2005 world expo in the japanese city of aichi . the era of the zeppelin as a mode of transport ended when the german-made hindenburg caught fire in new jersey in 1937 , killing 35 of the 96 people on board . red tape hassles dr bernd sträter , the managing director of zeppelin luftschifftechnik corporation which built the airship , indicated his japanese customers had decided to abandon the journey and send the airship back to germany due to bureaucratic problems . " the contract was signed in march this year and the time was very short to train the pilots and bring the ship to the japanese certification board , " sträter told dw-radio .
" and as far as i know the japanese nac shortly after signing sought the permission in russia .

" everyone who purchases planes tells you it takes a long time and that is the main reason . " ian aitchison , group communications officer for nyk europe , which owns a 53-percent stake in the airship , was more candid in his assessment of the problem earlier this month .
" besides weather , the delay is primarily due to -lsb- the -rsb- russian bureaucratic process and the need to slightly alter the flight path across russia , " aitchison said in a statement . aitchison also quelled earlier russian reports that a further reason for the delay was the airship pilot 's citizenship .
he holds a german passport and russian laws require the ship to be accompanied by a russian pilot . historic journey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 1929 photo of ferdinand graf von zeppelin , a german military officer who developed the airship , or dirigible , that bears his name .
the zeppelin , which is designed to travel great distances , had already put 3,000 kilometers behind it before being stopped in helsinki .
the journey was intended to commemorate the 75th anniversary of ferdinand graf von zeppelin 's round-the-world flight in 1929 . graf von zeppelin , a german military officer , is credited with developing the airship that bears his name . this newer model is a third of the size and can carry 12 people on board .
it was carrying a six-person crew from japan and germany and was expected to take 30 days to travel from st petersburg to vladivostok , and then onto japan , stopping several times en route . security concerns and bad weather but as the accompanying ground crew increased , russia raised concerns about security explained sträter . " originally it was planned to do it within three weeks , but meanwhile also for security reasons a lot of people have to accompany by road in trucks and this was originally not foreseen and so i believe 4-5 weeks should be the crossing time from st petersburg to vladisvostock or to the pacific , " he said . sträter also pointed to worsening weather conditions in southeast russia as a further reason for the stalling of the project . " the main reason to stop this activity was because of the weather conditions in siberia .
everybody has to calculate that end of september the cold comes in and the airship will have to stop somewhere there without any protection against wind and weather and there 's no opportunity to bring it back to western europe or to japan . " delivery problems sträter explained that simply packing up the airship and shipping it to japan was not an option . " the zeppelin new technology is the newest technology in the world and the largest in the world , with a lot of high performance activities which not any other airships has , " sträter said .

" we want jobs , " angry protestors yelled as the projectiles flew . at a job center in berlin this week , an enraged man who felt benefits were being unfairly withheld from him , attacked a secretary with a knife , wounding her in the arm before colleagues could restrain him . while these and other similar events might be individual , even exceptional incidents , some experts say they are consequences of a population on the edge , upset at what is seen by many as the abandonment of long-held principles of social fairness and frightened of a possible future in poverty . aggressive and violent behavior , experts say , could increase as welfare benefits are cut and people feel they have no other way to express their opposition and anger . " right now they are individual incidents , but they are likely only the beginning , " paul saatkamp , head of the lower rhine chapter of the awo social welfare organization , told dw-world .
" in january , when one million people lose their benefits , then it could really take off . " high social tension bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz the labor market and welfare changes being introduced by schröder 's government , named hartz iv after their author , volkswagen 's personnel chief peter hartz -lrb- photo -rrb- , are the biggest social reforms in germany 's post-war history . the government says they are necessary to revive the country 's struggling economy and save a social system threatened with collapse due to high unemployment and an aging population .
long-term unemployment benefits are to be reduced to the level of social welfare payments , meaning a large cut in income for many families . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration against the hartz iv reforms in the eastern german town of brandenburg the changes have brought thousands of germans out to the streets for so-called " monday demonstrations " over the past three weeks , primarily in eastern germany , where the economy is weakest and unemployment is highest . the chairman of germany 's police union , konrad freiberg , expressed fears that the social tension caused by the reforms and protests could lead to an upsurge in violence , especially against employees of job centers and welfare offices . " in general we 're seeing more violence in our society and the police are being called out more and more , " he told the express newspaper in cologne .
" they 're especially called to welfare offices because employees there are increasingly being threatened and insulted , or violence is being used . " rising tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a job center violence in welfare and job centers has been on the increase over the several years , as the unemployed vent their frustration at being unable to find work or seeing the benefits reduced . " we 're had this problem for several years , " kerstin bauer of berlin 's friedrichshain-kreuzberg welfare office told dw-world .
" personally i worry about an upturn in the violence because of the heated discussion going on now about the reforms .
some people seem to think violence is a legitimate means to express their dissatisfaction . " in the state of thuringia , the job center in the town of nordhauser has hired five private security guards to make rounds and quell potential trouble .
in the district of neukölln in berlin , five youths recently took their frustrations out on a desk officer , beating him severely . " i anticipate that these kind of excesses are just going to increase because of hartz iv , " achim berger , deputy head of the center 's workers ' council , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . the federal labor office , located in nuremberg , is watching the developments in the debate over hartz iv closely and trying to prepare in case the fallout becomes more serious , according to spokeswoman ilone mierschen . " our security plans have been reviewed or are being reviewed so that if we do see an increase in violent incidents , we will be ready for them , " she told dw-world . irritated , but mostly calm however , she and some others insist it is too early to talk about the reforms sparking a general trend toward more violent behavior . " i think the violent incidents we have seen recently are exceptions , " dr. jürgen mittag , a social researcher at the university of bochum , told dw-world .
" it 's true that some tempers are at a all-time high , but we should n't engage in generalizations about the whole of society . " he agrees that the uncertainty among many about their future has led to unusual levels of frustration , anger and feelings of powerlessness , but does not see it spiralling out of control .
that is a barrier , he said , that will not likely be crossed . new intensity , new forms ? however , that could depend on the future direction of the protest movement , which is still going strong .
much hangs on the nature of the demonstrations , whether they remain unified or are split among different factions .
the role of the unions and their calls to action will also determine how the protests develop . peter grottian , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said the population 's anger could increase as politicians refuse to soften any more of the reform 's harder edges . " the level of aggression is very high right now and it 's likely to get worse with time , " he told dw-world .
he said that does not expressly mean more violence , but protests could take a turn . " i think the traditional protest forms are going to expand and we 're going to see more civil disobedience actions , " he said . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de protests turn ugly as eggs and insults fly the wave of protests against the german government 's proposed welfare and job market reforms took a nasty turn on tuesday as chancellor gerhard schröder ran the gauntlet of public unrest in the east of the country .

losing 4-1 to a rampant bayer leverkusen team was not part of the plan . with the grouping for the opening phase of the european champions league decided , both bayer leverkusen and bayern munich could get on with the domestic business of attempting to win the bundesliga .
while the likes of real madrid and juventus lie in wait , leverkusen and munich will face stern tests in the coming months as they aim to capitalize on their chances in the continent 's premier cup competition .
but saturday was all about the bundesliga ; the meeting of old rivals , the reunion of old friends and the race for the title this leg of this race got off to a false start for bayern .
it is not unsusual for the visiting team to wait and see what the home side aims to throw at them but munich seemed unprpared for what leverkusen had in store for them .
bayern looked nervous in the opening minutes .
owen hargreaves , usually a defensive midfielder , started the game as a left-back and looked a little lost and unsure on the ball .
with leverkusen 's wide men krzynowek and berbatov rampaging from the off , bayern looked unbalanced at the back .
intelligent play set tempo for bayer leverkusen began to spread the play wide with krzynowek seeing more and more of the ball .
through the middle , ponte was more than a match for ballack and deisler and berbatov was mesmerizing first hargreaves and then thomas linke as the attacks increased pace and frequency .
one particular move into the box looked to have been interupted by hargreaves ' hand , a fact the replay confirmed , but the penalty never came desipte cries from the crowd and the leverkusen attackers .
krzynowek continued to dominate the left flank as the half progressed and more and more of leverkusen 's attacks involved his wing play . with the midfield under ponte 's control , bayern looked to counter-attack but the home side look happy to soak up the pressure and release their wide men at every opportunity .
berbatov too hot to handle for hargreaves bayern 's defensive liabilities were exposed after 20 minutes .
hargreaves was robbed by berbatov on the edge of the area .
the striker chased the skidding ball into the area and slotted it beyond kahn to take the lead .
the pattern of the game varied little for the rest of the half .
leverkusen smothered the rare bayern attacks and constantly threatened at the other end .
it was only in the second half when leverkusen 's full potential would be realized .
the attacking confidence seen in spurts and carefully staged offensive moves during the first 45 minutes was unleashed as bayern looked to get on equal terms .
second half mauling started early munich did n't stand a chance .
within six minutes of the restart , franca traded passes with berbatov on the edge of the area before lobbing kahn with power from the outside of his left foot .
five minutes later , the brazilian scored again .
after weaving through the defense , franca hit a skidding shot under kahn from the edge of the box with the goalkeeper clutching at the wet ball in vain .
and only three minutes after that , it was 4-0 .
berbatov and franca again combined well and this time the brazilian set up his striking partner to whip in a shot from the edge of the box to kill the game .
game over at hour mark the match was over by the 60 minute mark with a cat and mouse game ensuing .
bayern were the dying mouse with leverkusen 's indifferent cat toying with its prey as the last seconds of life drained from it .
in what could be seen as a deaththroe , michael ballack scored from distance to give bayern something to take back home to bavaria .
bayern will have to produce much better displays in europe if they want to survive .
leverkusen , however , may have another champions league adventure on their hands if they continue to play like this . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tough times ahead for germans in champions league werder bremen , bayern munich and bayer leverkusen discovered their european champions league fate on thursday .

humphrys , who presents the today programme , told an audience of media executives at the edinburgh television festival on friday night that " some of our worst television is indeed indefensible " .
he called for greater regulation of terrestrial television and even possible government intervention to ensure standards are maintained .
the three-day festival is host to the most important figures in british television , and features talks and seminars given by the heads of channel 4 , five , sky and the bbc .
humphrys used the prestigious mctaggart lecture to say reality tv " eroded the distinction between the public and the private , which is a profoundly important aspect of our culture " .
he called channel 4 's hit show big brother " damaging " and said the most recent show had " bequeathed us a legacy ; the way to get ratings is to get evil " . "
reality tv turns human beings into freaks for us to gawp at " john humphrys people who wanted to watch reality television could do so on subscription channels but society should " limit the harm " by stronger regulation of commercial channels by the government , he said .
the cardiff-born presenter said tv was now " a battle between people who are concerned about society and those whose overwhelming interest is simply to make programmes that make money " .
humphrys also warned that news coverage of politics should not be made " more fun " in an attempt to boost public interest . "
the quality of the best television is not just as good as it ever was , i suspect ... some of it is even better " john humphrys he said he disagreed with the former bbc director general greg dyke who said it was the broadcaster 's job to make politics less boring by making the coverage less boring .
" we should n't be trying to lure -lsb- viewers and listeners -rsb- into politics by pretending that it 's just another game show .
" greg got it wrong , " he said .
and as the presenter on radio 4 when andrew gilligan 's news report into the government 's iraq dossier unleashed a storm of controversy , he said news needed " more , not less in-depth interviewing of politicians " . "
i 've been reminded that television ... can help maintain the momentum that takes us from barbarity to civilisation " john humphrys in a thinly-veiled dig at the bbc 's measures taken since the hutton report criticised the bbc 's approach to news , he said mistakes would always be made " however many notes we take and however many people we send back to college " .
have your say " love them or hate them , reality tv programmes are here to stay " darren coleman , westbury , uk he told the conference he has not watched television for the last five years , but said he had based his opinions on watching programmes sent to him by executives as examples of the best of the medium .
he praised programmes such as channel 4 's operatunity and the bbc 's life of mammals , saying he had been " informed , entertained and deeply moved by some of what i 've seen " .
" i 've been reminded that television ... can help maintain the momentum that takes us from barbarity to civilisation " .
but he said a " vast amount of the rest is simply mediocre " and did not tell the audience if his recent viewing would mean he would become a regular viewer again .
the veteran broadcaster expressed incredulity that programmes such as your face or mine , the pilot show , banzai and nip / tuck were considered quality television .
examples of good television " can not pay the dues of the bad when the bad is indefensible " , he added . "
i 'm personally profoundly relieved that the bbc has avoided the worst excesses of reality television " john humphrys and television was " more aggressive and confrontational " and " vulgar and obsessed with sex " than he remembered .
he warned that such television could " coarsen " and " brutalise " and said the level of aggression he found in soaps " fits my definition of harmful - especially given that they 're broadcast pre-watershed " .
he also admitted that the bbc produced its share of rubbish and quality programmes - the corporation 's responsibilities were greater than they have ever been , he added .
