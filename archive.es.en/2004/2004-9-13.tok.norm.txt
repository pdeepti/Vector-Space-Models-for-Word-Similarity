however , the top slot and the unbeaten run were relinquished on the road as mainz pulled off a 2-0 victory over the early season pace setters . four days before the start of their champions league campaign against real madrid , leverkusen were chopped down , first by niclas weiland who put promoted mainz in front from a swift counter-attack in the 65th minute before fellow striker benjamin auer doubled their lead with a superb shot from the edge of box three minutes later . another team warming up for champions league action was bayern munich .
happily for the bavarians , their visit to maccabi tel aviv will come on the back of a victory courtesy of dutch striker roy makaay , who raced into the box unchallenged to score on 26 minutes to score the only and deciding goal in the game with arminia bielefeld . bayern , who climb five places to fifth , failed to shine but at least bounced back from the heavy defeat by leverkusen in their previous league outing . dortmund miss out in ruhr derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the showpiece ruhr valley derby , borussia dortmund failed to beat bochum in an eventful match because of an own goal by french defender guy demel in the 75th minute .
cameroon defender raymond kalla put bochum ahead on 15 minutes when he headed home from close range but the visitors equalized three minutes into the second half courtesy of another headed goal , this time from giant czech striker jan koller . dortmund goalkeeper guillaume warmuz then saved a penalty from denmark striker peter madsen in the 56th minute .
a header by brazilian striker ewerthon put dortmund 2-1 up three minutes later and dortmund looked to have secured victory before demel 's aberration made the final score 2-2 . one of the shocks of the weekend came at the borussia park where mönchengladbach beat champions werder bremen 3-1 to hand out the title holders their second consecutive defeat just three days before a visit to inter milan in their first ever champions league outing . champions defeated again czech forward marek heinz opened the scoring for the home side with a header from a corner on 11 minutes , an advantage which was then doubled by oliver neuville in the 53rd .
substitute striker nelson valdez restored hope for werder in the 69th minute but mönchengladbach held on for their first win of the season completed by substitute vladimir ivic in stoppage time . schalke 04 's miserable season continued at wolfsburg where the royal blues went down 3-0 , courtesy of two goals from bulgaria midfielder marian hristov and argentine striker diego klimowicz .
hristov opened the scoring with a header from a free kick in the 30th minute and doubled the advantage in similar fashion 10 minutes later .
klimowicz rounded off the win on the stroke of full time .

an early goal from midfielder silvio meissner and a late one by hungary striker imre szabics were enough to secure the points and top slot in the bundesliga . hertha berlin had to be content with their fourth draw from as many games after a dull match with few highlights against nuremburg in the other game played on saturday . surprise package freiburg extended their unbeaten run to four games by recovering from two goals down to share the points in the 2-2 draw with hanover on sunday .
two goals from czech striker jiri stajner gave hanover a 2-0 lead after just eight minutes but freiburg responded after the break with goals from strikers regis dorn and ellery cairo . long haul north yields three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern fans finally have something to cheer about .
in the other sunday game , kaiserslautern moved off the bottom and made coach kurt jara 's position slightly more comfortable with their first victory of the season as they beat hansa rostock 2-3 in the northern germany .
the four-time champions led 3-0 after first-half goals from defender thomas drescher and midfielder thomas riedl and one after the interval by striker halil altintop . rostock , still waiting for their first home win , reduced the arrears with two late goals from sweden striker marcus allback . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de action packed ruhr derby ends in draw vfl bochum drew with borussia dortmund in a classic ruhr valley derby on saturday 2-2 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 spain gets back to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero : re-orienting spanish policy toward the world spanish prime minister zapatero is meeting with his german and french counterparts in madrid on monday , a further step in fine-tuning spain 's relationship to europe . spain is in the news again .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .
" the spanish government says : ' if we behave like proper europeans , we have better chances of getting support for structural funds . " re-orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers from the plus ultra ii brigade who were based in iraq , disembark with a spanish flag with a bull printed on it on arrival at a spanish military base in talavera la real , western spain on april 20 , 2004 after they were relieved by another contingent of troops .
donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .
" it 's disappeared into a no man 's land - from the viewpoint of the franco-german axis . spain may be less visible now , but that 's only because it 's less vocal , not less important , manuel ecuvero , a macro-economic and international political analyst at instituto de empresa , spain 's leading business school , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission headquarters in brussels but spain has no leverage to prevent an end to its brussels cash flow , ecuvero said .
spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .
berlin , in particular , one of the countries that pays the highest per capita contribution to the eu , has made clear that that amount should decrease . " more and more there is the certainty that the structural funds will run out and we will have to stand on our own , " ecuvero conceded . no longer upside-down madrid has indeed changed its policies toward the eu under zapatero , including cultivating relations to france and germany .
but according to ecuvero , the aim was n't to create an overt alliance . " aznar turned traditional spanish international relations upside-down , " he said .
" we are refocusing our policy toward europe , toward latin america , toward the world .
zapatero is recovering the lines that spanish foreign policy has pursued for 50 years .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .
" even though the bundestag has clearly said ' no ' to therapeutic cloning , it is now time to readdress , and discuss the issue in a more precise and differentiated way , " spiros simitis said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper last month after the council debated the issue in berlin . council divided on cloning topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells .
it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .
scientists think human tissue produced from embryonic stem cells could be used to treat alzheimer 's , diabetes and other illnesses .
stem cells are non-specialized cells that can produce mature specialized cells . liberal states may attract scientists , families bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will " designer babies " start a boom in bio tourism ?
last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .
but the cdu deputy group leader maria böhmer has strongly rejected the idea . ulrich kasparick , a permanent secretary to the federal research ministry , said the ministry saw no need for action .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .
" even though the bundestag has clearly said ' no ' to therapeutic cloning , it is now time to readdress , and discuss the issue in a more precise and differentiated way , " spiros simitis said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper last month after the council debated the issue in berlin . council divided on cloning topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells .
it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .
scientists think human tissue produced from embryonic stem cells could be used to treat alzheimer 's , diabetes and other illnesses .
stem cells are non-specialized cells that can produce mature specialized cells . liberal states may attract scientists , families bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will " designer babies " start a boom in bio tourism ?
last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .
but the cdu deputy group leader maria böhmer has strongly rejected the idea . ulrich kasparick , a permanent secretary to the federal research ministry , said the ministry saw no need for action .

at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .

germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .

people in bed with someone who snores do n't only suffer when their partner is sleeping : they also do n't have as much sex as silent sleepers and when it happens it 's not as good . all the problems snorers , especially middle-aged men , have in bed come down to sleep apnea .
it 's the condition that causes people to stop breathing for a short time and wake up .
the drugs used to treat the problem also do their part in taking the fun out of sex .
people suffering from sleep apnea are often tired , which drives down their desire for sex .
while the side effects of drugs available to treat the condition often lead to declines in sexual performance .
" more than half of sleep apnea patients complain of loss of libido , " martin konermann , a medical professor at the university of kassel told the senioren ratgeber , a magazine given out free in germany 's pharmacies .
" that 's 10 times more than in the rest of the population . "
tired , unsatisfied partners still have one recourse : a breathing mask that can help get a good night 's sleep , which in turn drives the libido back up .
the easy-to-remove headgear is not known to influence the libido . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can you really judge a man by his car ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 eu calls for un probe of sudan genocide charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced sudanese women carry firewood to a refugee camp on monday , the european union 's foreign ministers urged the united nations to conduct an inquiry into allegations of genocide in sudan , renewing the threat of sanctions for the african country . the eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , also threatened to impose sanctions against the sudanese government if it did n't take action to disarm militias in the darfur region , where over a million people have been displaced and thousands killed by fighting .
at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and the sudanese foriegn minister mostafa osman ismail in khartoum on july 12 , 2004 .
germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .

socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .

donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .

socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .
" the spanish government says : ' if we behave like proper europeans , we have better chances of getting support for structural funds . " re-orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers from the plus ultra ii brigade who were based in iraq , disembark with a spanish flag with a bull printed on it on arrival at a spanish military base in talavera la real , western spain on april 20 , 2004 after they were relieved by another contingent of troops .
donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .
" it 's disappeared into a no man 's land - from the viewpoint of the franco-german axis . spain may be less visible now , but that 's only because it 's less vocal , not less important , manuel ecuvero , a macro-economic and international political analyst at instituto de empresa , spain 's leading business school , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission headquarters in brussels but spain has no leverage to prevent an end to its brussels cash flow , ecuvero said .
spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .
berlin , in particular , one of the countries that pays the highest per capita contribution to the eu , has made clear that that amount should decrease . " more and more there is the certainty that the structural funds will run out and we will have to stand on our own , " ecuvero conceded . no longer upside-down madrid has indeed changed its policies toward the eu under zapatero , including cultivating relations to france and germany .
but according to ecuvero , the aim was n't to create an overt alliance . " aznar turned traditional spanish international relations upside-down , " he said .
" we are refocusing our policy toward europe , toward latin america , toward the world .
zapatero is recovering the lines that spanish foreign policy has pursued for 50 years .

that is especially apparent in darfur 's humanitarian catastrophe , which has ministers " extremely concerned " but unable to enforce any action . while the un estimates that more than 50,000 people have been killed with another 1.2 million sudanese forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers have expressed their concern about a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word genocide has not been uttered by any of the eu 's foreign ministers , who will discuss the darfur situation at their monthly meeting monday .
they know how they label the situation will determine their next actions - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps demanded by their un obligation to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister fischer , left , met with sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in july " we need to keep up the pressure , " german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if the international community had not reacted so strongly , the humanitarian situation , which had potential to lead to genocide , would be much worse than today 's deplorable reality . "
the pressure was first put on in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can achieve because hesitance in italy , spain and greece keeps the eu from being able to demand stronger action .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition to the situation , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 1.2 million sudanese have been driven from their homes " i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .
" they know how to read the contradictory signs that were given by the international community in dealing politically with this issue . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 german press review : köhler under fire german editorials on monday commented on president horst köhler 's remarks that have fueled tensions inside the country over the financial costs of reunification . der neue tag in weiden warned that the debate should not be narrowed down to financial matters only .
the paper wrote that new ideas such as education or child care , medical services or care for the elderly are needed in the sparsely populated regions in eastern germany .
looking towards spain or scandinavia could help , according to the daily : there people had similar problems to solve , it concluded .
the südkurier in constance pointed out that the german president had only expressed what had long been a reality .
the billions of euros worth of subsidies poured into east for its development would n't bridge the prosperity gap between the west and east of the country .
cities such as cottbus and rostock still have record unemployment rates .
there was no trace of an upswing .
so there was no question that it was legitimate to call for a reform of the subsidies for the east , the paper wrote and praised the president for his courage in making that point .
but it added that his timing was off .
his controversial and untimely comments came before two local elections and the paper feared that this debate would only strengthen the radical parties .
in düsseldorf , the rheinische post wrote that the agitation in the east was largely over the simple truth expressed by köhler .
it noted that much of the angst was attributed to careless election campaigning .
the indignity and outrage expressed only highlight the truth of köhler ’ s comments , according to the paper .
permanent subsidies corrupt thinking , it noted .
those who received subsidies were like junkies – they could not imagine living without being funded by the state .
but was that a good enough reason for germany to invest in the east more than the americans had into their entire global military presence , asked the paper and concluded that everyone knew that this could n't continue .
die welt in berlin wrote that köhler after his election in may had promised to speak out on political and economic issues .
the need for change in germany had demanded this from the highest office holder of the country .
köhler has now proven this , opined the paper .
but it was surprised over the angry reaction over köhler ’ s comments from the political camps .
it appeared as if the former east had waited for such a signal in order to raise a warning finger to point to the fact that the country was not unified , according to the paper .
such messages are not new and this was evidenced in the weekly demonstrations , wrote the daily , admonishing germans to overcome the split in society .
this was the central message of köhler ’ s inaugural speech .
the president has shown the need for honesty , the paper concluded .
the stuttgarter nachrichten wrote that the president would have to explain himself .
his comments on the economic disparities between the east and west raised questions about the country ’ s constitution .
the paper said the issue was not equality but on how the country could be rearranged to help the weaker regions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "
playing the same game ?
" it 's always the same " , a british diplomat recently complained .
" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .
the united states , frustrated with iran 's tug-of-war , signaled that time was running out for iran to cooperate with the international community .
meanwhile , europe antagonized the us by lobbying for more negotiations and rejecting proposals to pass the matter along to the un security council .
this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .
in the last several months , iran has also proven less open to europe 's diplomacy .

rather than threatening with an ultimatum and sanctions as the us has suggested , such a time frame would once again give iran the chance to modify its nuclear policies over the next two months and avoid a full confrontation with the united states .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .

europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 spain gets back to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero : re-orienting spanish policy toward the world spanish prime minister zapatero is meeting with his german and french counterparts in madrid on monday , a further step in fine-tuning spain 's relationship to europe . spain is in the news again .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .
" the spanish government says : ' if we behave like proper europeans , we have better chances of getting support for structural funds . " re-orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers from the plus ultra ii brigade who were based in iraq , disembark with a spanish flag with a bull printed on it on arrival at a spanish military base in talavera la real , western spain on april 20 , 2004 after they were relieved by another contingent of troops .
donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .
" it 's disappeared into a no man 's land - from the viewpoint of the franco-german axis . spain may be less visible now , but that 's only because it 's less vocal , not less important , manuel ecuvero , a macro-economic and international political analyst at instituto de empresa , spain 's leading business school , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission headquarters in brussels but spain has no leverage to prevent an end to its brussels cash flow , ecuvero said .
spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .
berlin , in particular , one of the countries that pays the highest per capita contribution to the eu , has made clear that that amount should decrease . " more and more there is the certainty that the structural funds will run out and we will have to stand on our own , " ecuvero conceded . no longer upside-down madrid has indeed changed its policies toward the eu under zapatero , including cultivating relations to france and germany .
but according to ecuvero , the aim was n't to create an overt alliance . " aznar turned traditional spanish international relations upside-down , " he said .
" we are refocusing our policy toward europe , toward latin america , toward the world .
zapatero is recovering the lines that spanish foreign policy has pursued for 50 years .

however , the top slot and the unbeaten run were relinquished on the road as mainz pulled off a 2-0 victory over the early season pace setters . four days before the start of their champions league campaign against real madrid , leverkusen were chopped down , first by niclas weiland who put promoted mainz in front from a swift counter-attack in the 65th minute before fellow striker benjamin auer doubled their lead with a superb shot from the edge of box three minutes later . another team warming up for champions league action was bayern munich .
happily for the bavarians , their visit to maccabi tel aviv will come on the back of a victory courtesy of dutch striker roy makaay , who raced into the box unchallenged to score on 26 minutes to score the only and deciding goal in the game with arminia bielefeld . bayern , who climb five places to fifth , failed to shine but at least bounced back from the heavy defeat by leverkusen in their previous league outing . dortmund miss out in ruhr derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the showpiece ruhr valley derby , borussia dortmund failed to beat bochum in an eventful match because of an own goal by french defender guy demel in the 75th minute .
cameroon defender raymond kalla put bochum ahead on 15 minutes when he headed home from close range but the visitors equalized three minutes into the second half courtesy of another headed goal , this time from giant czech striker jan koller . dortmund goalkeeper guillaume warmuz then saved a penalty from denmark striker peter madsen in the 56th minute .

however , the top slot and the unbeaten run were relinquished on the road as mainz pulled off a 2-0 victory over the early season pace setters . four days before the start of their champions league campaign against real madrid , leverkusen were chopped down , first by niclas weiland who put promoted mainz in front from a swift counter-attack in the 65th minute before fellow striker benjamin auer doubled their lead with a superb shot from the edge of box three minutes later . another team warming up for champions league action was bayern munich .
happily for the bavarians , their visit to maccabi tel aviv will come on the back of a victory courtesy of dutch striker roy makaay , who raced into the box unchallenged to score on 26 minutes to score the only and deciding goal in the game with arminia bielefeld . bayern , who climb five places to fifth , failed to shine but at least bounced back from the heavy defeat by leverkusen in their previous league outing . dortmund miss out in ruhr derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the showpiece ruhr valley derby , borussia dortmund failed to beat bochum in an eventful match because of an own goal by french defender guy demel in the 75th minute .
cameroon defender raymond kalla put bochum ahead on 15 minutes when he headed home from close range but the visitors equalized three minutes into the second half courtesy of another headed goal , this time from giant czech striker jan koller . dortmund goalkeeper guillaume warmuz then saved a penalty from denmark striker peter madsen in the 56th minute .

do n't even ask großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bloggers from around the world participate in the bobs awards starting on sept .
17 , you may be asking yourself : " what the heck is a weblog ? "
konstantin klein gives his answer here . here 's a tip : just do n't ask anyone what a blog actually is .
the chances are good that you wo n't get any smarter from the answer .
because you 'll likely either ask someone who has never heard the term before and frankly admits that , or you 'll ask someone who has his or her own blog .
that 's even worse .
but let 's just get to the facts .
" blog " is a term that first began to appear on english web sites in the late nineties .
it melts together the words " web " as in internet and " log " as in book .
in other words , it 's a logbook of a person journeying through the world wide web .
bloggers log interesting observations from their journeys in the log and because the same log is available on the net , anyone can read it .
in order to give the reader something to observe , too , links referring to the subject of the log should also be included - mostly to other web sites , and the link is no problem .
in order to make a web log a weblog , the entries also have to be updated - just like a logbook .
see , that was n't so hard !
the real problem starts with the web loggers .
because they are , even if they would try to distance themselves from disgust or indignation , not really any different from other people with hobbies , like golf gti collectors or postage stamp collectors or dachshund enthusiasts .
in other words : they have their own way of producing a weblog , washing a gti , peeling off a stamp or feeding a dachshund .
they know what they 're doing , and everyone else is just an amateur .
but do n't let anyone know where you got that from !
the consequences are bad enough .
not only because a holy war has practically developed in the german-speaking world over whether to they should be called " weblogs " or whether they should be called " blogs " -lrb- but here 's an insider tip : it 's called a " weblog " ! -rrb- , or whether a weblog must have a certain number of links in order to differentiate itself from a web diary -lrb- insider tip : i have no idea ! -rrb- or whether a web diary can even be called a weblog !
-lrb- insider tip : no !
of course !
never !
but surely !
absolutely never ! & % $ $ # @ $ * * & % $ & $ @ ! -rrb- .
in addition , there 's also the technical discussion about whether a weblog should be produced using blogging software , in the homelike surroundings of a blogger community , or whether it would be better to have individually installed and customized technology that runs , if possible , off a person 's own server .
unwritten weblog rules and finally , there are unwritten rules for bloggers that require a little self-confidence to break .
to a certain extent , every weblog has to feature pictures of cats every week and they have to link at least once a week to an article that either proves or refutes the idea that weblogs are the form of " grassroots journalism . "
they have to be redesigned at least twice a year , and at least once a year they need to be closed again due to apathy .
but fortunately that 's all a bit exaggerated - even if only a little bit .
for weblogs are nothing more than regularly updated , very subjective , often demonically funny , sometimes even literary and not too seldom political web sites that are made , cultivated and written by individualists who have something to say and , for the most part , can express themselves well .
weblogs are not news sources .
instead they offer commentary about the world and the personal state of the author .
and in this sense , it 's also true that they are hyperventilating , hyper-babble of the hyper - the simplest , fastest and cheapest possibility to reach an audience of millions .
theoretically ... ... because the success of a weblog is quite dependent on the abilities of the writer .
if you want to try yourself , but do n't know anything about the technology at work backstage in your web browser , then you can also attempt it by opening up an account at services like blogger.com , typepad.com or salon.com.
if you 've already heard of html and do n't mistake ftp for a german political party , then you can also set up an account with a webhoster , install a program like moveabletype.org , pmachine.com -lrb- both available free in their simplest versions -rrb- , nucleuscms.org , wordpress.org or textpattern.com and just start typing .

it melts together the words " web " as in internet and " log " as in book .
in other words , it 's a logbook of a person journeying through the world wide web .
bloggers log interesting observations from their journeys in the log and because the same log is available on the net , anyone can read it .
in order to give the reader something to observe , too , links referring to the subject of the log should also be included - mostly to other web sites , and the link is no problem .
in order to make a web log a weblog , the entries also have to be updated - just like a logbook .
see , that was n't so hard !
the real problem starts with the web loggers .
because they are , even if they would try to distance themselves from disgust or indignation , not really any different from other people with hobbies , like golf gti collectors or postage stamp collectors or dachshund enthusiasts .
in other words : they have their own way of producing a weblog , washing a gti , peeling off a stamp or feeding a dachshund .
they know what they 're doing , and everyone else is just an amateur .
but do n't let anyone know where you got that from !
the consequences are bad enough .
not only because a holy war has practically developed in the german-speaking world over whether to they should be called " weblogs " or whether they should be called " blogs " -lrb- but here 's an insider tip : it 's called a " weblog " ! -rrb- , or whether a weblog must have a certain number of links in order to differentiate itself from a web diary -lrb- insider tip : i have no idea ! -rrb- or whether a web diary can even be called a weblog !
-lrb- insider tip : no !
of course !
never !

absolutely never ! & % $ $ # @ $ * * & % $ & $ @ ! -rrb- .
in addition , there 's also the technical discussion about whether a weblog should be produced using blogging software , in the homelike surroundings of a blogger community , or whether it would be better to have individually installed and customized technology that runs , if possible , off a person 's own server .
unwritten weblog rules and finally , there are unwritten rules for bloggers that require a little self-confidence to break .
to a certain extent , every weblog has to feature pictures of cats every week and they have to link at least once a week to an article that either proves or refutes the idea that weblogs are the form of " grassroots journalism . "
they have to be redesigned at least twice a year , and at least once a year they need to be closed again due to apathy .
but fortunately that 's all a bit exaggerated - even if only a little bit .
for weblogs are nothing more than regularly updated , very subjective , often demonically funny , sometimes even literary and not too seldom political web sites that are made , cultivated and written by individualists who have something to say and , for the most part , can express themselves well .
weblogs are not news sources .
instead they offer commentary about the world and the personal state of the author .
and in this sense , it 's also true that they are hyperventilating , hyper-babble of the hyper - the simplest , fastest and cheapest possibility to reach an audience of millions .
theoretically ... ... because the success of a weblog is quite dependent on the abilities of the writer .

" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up .

socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .

donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .

spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .

however , the top slot and the unbeaten run were relinquished on the road as mainz pulled off a 2-0 victory over the early season pace setters . four days before the start of their champions league campaign against real madrid , leverkusen were chopped down , first by niclas weiland who put promoted mainz in front from a swift counter-attack in the 65th minute before fellow striker benjamin auer doubled their lead with a superb shot from the edge of box three minutes later . another team warming up for champions league action was bayern munich .
happily for the bavarians , their visit to maccabi tel aviv will come on the back of a victory courtesy of dutch striker roy makaay , who raced into the box unchallenged to score on 26 minutes to score the only and deciding goal in the game with arminia bielefeld . bayern , who climb five places to fifth , failed to shine but at least bounced back from the heavy defeat by leverkusen in their previous league outing . dortmund miss out in ruhr derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the showpiece ruhr valley derby , borussia dortmund failed to beat bochum in an eventful match because of an own goal by french defender guy demel in the 75th minute .
cameroon defender raymond kalla put bochum ahead on 15 minutes when he headed home from close range but the visitors equalized three minutes into the second half courtesy of another headed goal , this time from giant czech striker jan koller . dortmund goalkeeper guillaume warmuz then saved a penalty from denmark striker peter madsen in the 56th minute .
a header by brazilian striker ewerthon put dortmund 2-1 up three minutes later and dortmund looked to have secured victory before demel 's aberration made the final score 2-2 . one of the shocks of the weekend came at the borussia park where mönchengladbach beat champions werder bremen 3-1 to hand out the title holders their second consecutive defeat just three days before a visit to inter milan in their first ever champions league outing . champions defeated again czech forward marek heinz opened the scoring for the home side with a header from a corner on 11 minutes , an advantage which was then doubled by oliver neuville in the 53rd .
substitute striker nelson valdez restored hope for werder in the 69th minute but mönchengladbach held on for their first win of the season completed by substitute vladimir ivic in stoppage time . schalke 04 's miserable season continued at wolfsburg where the royal blues went down 3-0 , courtesy of two goals from bulgaria midfielder marian hristov and argentine striker diego klimowicz .
hristov opened the scoring with a header from a free kick in the 30th minute and doubled the advantage in similar fashion 10 minutes later .
klimowicz rounded off the win on the stroke of full time .
wolfsburg 's convincing victory lifted them up to second place , just one point off the lead . stuttgart take pole position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of them at the top of the league sits stuttgart after a 2-0 victory over hamburg , whose own mini revival came to an end and went back to heading in the opposite direction , sliding back to fourth from bottom .
an early goal from midfielder silvio meissner and a late one by hungary striker imre szabics were enough to secure the points and top slot in the bundesliga . hertha berlin had to be content with their fourth draw from as many games after a dull match with few highlights against nuremburg in the other game played on saturday . surprise package freiburg extended their unbeaten run to four games by recovering from two goals down to share the points in the 2-2 draw with hanover on sunday .
two goals from czech striker jiri stajner gave hanover a 2-0 lead after just eight minutes but freiburg responded after the break with goals from strikers regis dorn and ellery cairo . long haul north yields three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern fans finally have something to cheer about .
in the other sunday game , kaiserslautern moved off the bottom and made coach kurt jara 's position slightly more comfortable with their first victory of the season as they beat hansa rostock 2-3 in the northern germany .
the four-time champions led 3-0 after first-half goals from defender thomas drescher and midfielder thomas riedl and one after the interval by striker halil altintop . rostock , still waiting for their first home win , reduced the arrears with two late goals from sweden striker marcus allback . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de action packed ruhr derby ends in draw vfl bochum drew with borussia dortmund in a classic ruhr valley derby on saturday 2-2 .

people in bed with someone who snores do n't only suffer when their partner is sleeping : they also do n't have as much sex as silent sleepers and when it happens it 's not as good . all the problems snorers , especially middle-aged men , have in bed come down to sleep apnea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc spelling of ' euro ' creates unexpected headache european central bank president jean-claude trichet informed ministers that the word ' euro ' was being spelled differently across europe .
in slovenia , for example , it is called ' evro ' .
latvians - if and when they join the common currency - will pay with ' eiro ' and in hungary , the word has an accent .
this contravenes a regulation drawn up by eu leaders in 1997 that the word must be spelled ' euro ' in all official languages .
greece , however , is exempt because it has a different alphabet .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said , " we were surprised to find that this problem existed , but we solved it , " joking , " you see how decisive finance ministers can sometimes be . "
however , he was flummoxed by a question asking what form the plural should take .
some use ' euro ' , others ' euros . '
the problem is unlikely to arise in the new member states for a few years .
although all ten new entrants to the eu club are treaty-bound to join the single currency , none is likely to do so before 2007 .

at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and the sudanese foriegn minister mostafa osman ismail in khartoum on july 12 , 2004 .
germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .

at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .

germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .
" they know how to read the contradictory signs that were given by the international community in dealing politically with this issue . " dw staff -lrb- dsl / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unanimity slows eu response in sudan lack of agreement keeps the eu from flexing its foreign policy muscles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 german press review : köhler under fire german editorials on monday commented on president horst köhler 's remarks that have fueled tensions inside the country over the financial costs of reunification . der neue tag in weiden warned that the debate should not be narrowed down to financial matters only .
the paper wrote that new ideas such as education or child care , medical services or care for the elderly are needed in the sparsely populated regions in eastern germany .
looking towards spain or scandinavia could help , according to the daily : there people had similar problems to solve , it concluded .
the südkurier in constance pointed out that the german president had only expressed what had long been a reality .
the billions of euros worth of subsidies poured into east for its development would n't bridge the prosperity gap between the west and east of the country .
cities such as cottbus and rostock still have record unemployment rates .
there was no trace of an upswing .
so there was no question that it was legitimate to call for a reform of the subsidies for the east , the paper wrote and praised the president for his courage in making that point .
but it added that his timing was off .
his controversial and untimely comments came before two local elections and the paper feared that this debate would only strengthen the radical parties .
in düsseldorf , the rheinische post wrote that the agitation in the east was largely over the simple truth expressed by köhler .
it noted that much of the angst was attributed to careless election campaigning .
the indignity and outrage expressed only highlight the truth of köhler ’ s comments , according to the paper .
permanent subsidies corrupt thinking , it noted .
those who received subsidies were like junkies – they could not imagine living without being funded by the state .
but was that a good enough reason for germany to invest in the east more than the americans had into their entire global military presence , asked the paper and concluded that everyone knew that this could n't continue .
die welt in berlin wrote that köhler after his election in may had promised to speak out on political and economic issues .
the need for change in germany had demanded this from the highest office holder of the country .
köhler has now proven this , opined the paper .

providing subsidies to bridge those differences , particularly in the six eastern states , would burden the younger generation with very high debts . " there were and are everywhere in the republic large differences in living standards , " köhler was quoted as saying .
" if you want to level them out , you cement the subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the young generation .

providing subsidies to bridge those differences , particularly in the six eastern states , would burden the younger generation with very high debts . " there were and are everywhere in the republic large differences in living standards , " köhler was quoted as saying .
" if you want to level them out , you cement the subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the young generation .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "

" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .

this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .

rather than threatening with an ultimatum and sanctions as the us has suggested , such a time frame would once again give iran the chance to modify its nuclear policies over the next two months and avoid a full confrontation with the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 european leaders may get tough with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear plant in iran , scene of the controversy as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .
meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "
playing the same game ?
" it 's always the same " , a british diplomat recently complained .
" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .
the united states , frustrated with iran 's tug-of-war , signaled that time was running out for iran to cooperate with the international community .
meanwhile , europe antagonized the us by lobbying for more negotiations and rejecting proposals to pass the matter along to the un security council .
this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .
in the last several months , iran has also proven less open to europe 's diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed el baradei , secretary general iaea a european draft resolution , proposed by britain , france and germany , could call on iaea secretary general mohamed el baradei -lrb- photo -rrb- to file a report before the next board meeting in november and make a " definite determination on whether or not further steps are required , " a diplomat close to iaea told afp .
rather than threatening with an ultimatum and sanctions as the us has suggested , such a time frame would once again give iran the chance to modify its nuclear policies over the next two months and avoid a full confrontation with the united states .
but should iran pass up this last chance , they may not find a willing advocate for further negotiations in the europe - that is if eu foreign ministers back-up monday 's tough talk with tough actions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .
the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un .
-lrb- sept .
7 , 2004 -rrb- europe mum over next step on iran the us says it 's working with europe on a " tough set of resolutions " demanding iran 's compliance on the nuclear issue , but it 's not clear whether europe will abandon its engagement with iran to follow the us position .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .

but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .

last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .
" even though the bundestag has clearly said ' no ' to therapeutic cloning , it is now time to readdress , and discuss the issue in a more precise and differentiated way , " spiros simitis said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper last month after the council debated the issue in berlin . council divided on cloning topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells .
it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .
scientists think human tissue produced from embryonic stem cells could be used to treat alzheimer 's , diabetes and other illnesses .
stem cells are non-specialized cells that can produce mature specialized cells . liberal states may attract scientists , families bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will " designer babies " start a boom in bio tourism ?
last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .
but the cdu deputy group leader maria böhmer has strongly rejected the idea . ulrich kasparick , a permanent secretary to the federal research ministry , said the ministry saw no need for action . " there is no majority for changing the ban on cloning , " he told the faz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " designer baby " gets go-ahead a couple in northern ireland have been given permission to proceed with a controversial stem-cell therapy which could save their young son .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 spain gets back to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero : re-orienting spanish policy toward the world spanish prime minister zapatero is meeting with his german and french counterparts in madrid on monday , a further step in fine-tuning spain 's relationship to europe . spain is in the news again .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 european leaders may get tough with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear plant in iran , scene of the controversy as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .
meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "
playing the same game ?
" it 's always the same " , a british diplomat recently complained .
" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .
the united states , frustrated with iran 's tug-of-war , signaled that time was running out for iran to cooperate with the international community .
meanwhile , europe antagonized the us by lobbying for more negotiations and rejecting proposals to pass the matter along to the un security council .
this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .
in the last several months , iran has also proven less open to europe 's diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed el baradei , secretary general iaea a european draft resolution , proposed by britain , france and germany , could call on iaea secretary general mohamed el baradei -lrb- photo -rrb- to file a report before the next board meeting in november and make a " definite determination on whether or not further steps are required , " a diplomat close to iaea told afp .
rather than threatening with an ultimatum and sanctions as the us has suggested , such a time frame would once again give iran the chance to modify its nuclear policies over the next two months and avoid a full confrontation with the united states .
but should iran pass up this last chance , they may not find a willing advocate for further negotiations in the europe - that is if eu foreign ministers back-up monday 's tough talk with tough actions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .
the eu has been calling on tehran to cooperate more closely with the un .
-lrb- sept .
7 , 2004 -rrb- europe mum over next step on iran the us says it 's working with europe on a " tough set of resolutions " demanding iran 's compliance on the nuclear issue , but it 's not clear whether europe will abandon its engagement with iran to follow the us position .

socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .
" the spanish government says : ' if we behave like proper europeans , we have better chances of getting support for structural funds . " re-orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers from the plus ultra ii brigade who were based in iraq , disembark with a spanish flag with a bull printed on it on arrival at a spanish military base in talavera la real , western spain on april 20 , 2004 after they were relieved by another contingent of troops .
donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .

the paper wrote that new ideas such as education or child care , medical services or care for the elderly are needed in the sparsely populated regions in eastern germany .
looking towards spain or scandinavia could help , according to the daily : there people had similar problems to solve , it concluded .
the südkurier in constance pointed out that the german president had only expressed what had long been a reality .
the billions of euros worth of subsidies poured into east for its development would n't bridge the prosperity gap between the west and east of the country .
cities such as cottbus and rostock still have record unemployment rates .
there was no trace of an upswing .
so there was no question that it was legitimate to call for a reform of the subsidies for the east , the paper wrote and praised the president for his courage in making that point .
but it added that his timing was off .
his controversial and untimely comments came before two local elections and the paper feared that this debate would only strengthen the radical parties .
in düsseldorf , the rheinische post wrote that the agitation in the east was largely over the simple truth expressed by köhler .
it noted that much of the angst was attributed to careless election campaigning .
the indignity and outrage expressed only highlight the truth of köhler ’ s comments , according to the paper .
permanent subsidies corrupt thinking , it noted .
those who received subsidies were like junkies – they could not imagine living without being funded by the state .
but was that a good enough reason for germany to invest in the east more than the americans had into their entire global military presence , asked the paper and concluded that everyone knew that this could n't continue .
die welt in berlin wrote that köhler after his election in may had promised to speak out on political and economic issues .
the need for change in germany had demanded this from the highest office holder of the country .
köhler has now proven this , opined the paper .
but it was surprised over the angry reaction over köhler ’ s comments from the political camps .
it appeared as if the former east had waited for such a signal in order to raise a warning finger to point to the fact that the country was not unified , according to the paper .
such messages are not new and this was evidenced in the weekly demonstrations , wrote the daily , admonishing germans to overcome the split in society .
this was the central message of köhler ’ s inaugural speech .
the president has shown the need for honesty , the paper concluded .
the stuttgarter nachrichten wrote that the president would have to explain himself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 european leaders may get tough with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear plant in iran , scene of the controversy as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .
meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "
playing the same game ?
" it 's always the same " , a british diplomat recently complained .
" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .
the united states , frustrated with iran 's tug-of-war , signaled that time was running out for iran to cooperate with the international community .
meanwhile , europe antagonized the us by lobbying for more negotiations and rejecting proposals to pass the matter along to the un security council .
this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .

according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .

eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .
in the last several months , iran has also proven less open to europe 's diplomacy .

at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and the sudanese foriegn minister mostafa osman ismail in khartoum on july 12 , 2004 .
germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 german press review : köhler under fire german editorials on monday commented on president horst köhler 's remarks that have fueled tensions inside the country over the financial costs of reunification . der neue tag in weiden warned that the debate should not be narrowed down to financial matters only .
the paper wrote that new ideas such as education or child care , medical services or care for the elderly are needed in the sparsely populated regions in eastern germany .
looking towards spain or scandinavia could help , according to the daily : there people had similar problems to solve , it concluded .
the südkurier in constance pointed out that the german president had only expressed what had long been a reality .
the billions of euros worth of subsidies poured into east for its development would n't bridge the prosperity gap between the west and east of the country .
cities such as cottbus and rostock still have record unemployment rates .
there was no trace of an upswing .
so there was no question that it was legitimate to call for a reform of the subsidies for the east , the paper wrote and praised the president for his courage in making that point .
but it added that his timing was off .
his controversial and untimely comments came before two local elections and the paper feared that this debate would only strengthen the radical parties .
in düsseldorf , the rheinische post wrote that the agitation in the east was largely over the simple truth expressed by köhler .
it noted that much of the angst was attributed to careless election campaigning .
the indignity and outrage expressed only highlight the truth of köhler ’ s comments , according to the paper .
permanent subsidies corrupt thinking , it noted .
those who received subsidies were like junkies – they could not imagine living without being funded by the state .
but was that a good enough reason for germany to invest in the east more than the americans had into their entire global military presence , asked the paper and concluded that everyone knew that this could n't continue .
die welt in berlin wrote that köhler after his election in may had promised to speak out on political and economic issues .
the need for change in germany had demanded this from the highest office holder of the country .
köhler has now proven this , opined the paper .
but it was surprised over the angry reaction over köhler ’ s comments from the political camps .
it appeared as if the former east had waited for such a signal in order to raise a warning finger to point to the fact that the country was not unified , according to the paper .
such messages are not new and this was evidenced in the weekly demonstrations , wrote the daily , admonishing germans to overcome the split in society .
this was the central message of köhler ’ s inaugural speech .
the president has shown the need for honesty , the paper concluded .
the stuttgarter nachrichten wrote that the president would have to explain himself .
his comments on the economic disparities between the east and west raised questions about the country ’ s constitution .
the paper said the issue was not equality but on how the country could be rearranged to help the weaker regions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.09.2004 germany 's ethics council rejects cloning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will continue to oppose human cloning for research the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits . the german national ethics council , the 25-member body created in 2001 by the federal government to offer advice on ethical issues in the life sciences , announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research .
the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .
" even though the bundestag has clearly said ' no ' to therapeutic cloning , it is now time to readdress , and discuss the issue in a more precise and differentiated way , " spiros simitis said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper last month after the council debated the issue in berlin . council divided on cloning topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells .
it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .
" even though the bundestag has clearly said ' no ' to therapeutic cloning , it is now time to readdress , and discuss the issue in a more precise and differentiated way , " spiros simitis said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper last month after the council debated the issue in berlin . council divided on cloning topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells .
it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .
scientists think human tissue produced from embryonic stem cells could be used to treat alzheimer 's , diabetes and other illnesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 german press review : köhler under fire german editorials on monday commented on president horst köhler 's remarks that have fueled tensions inside the country over the financial costs of reunification . der neue tag in weiden warned that the debate should not be narrowed down to financial matters only .
the paper wrote that new ideas such as education or child care , medical services or care for the elderly are needed in the sparsely populated regions in eastern germany .
looking towards spain or scandinavia could help , according to the daily : there people had similar problems to solve , it concluded .
the südkurier in constance pointed out that the german president had only expressed what had long been a reality .
the billions of euros worth of subsidies poured into east for its development would n't bridge the prosperity gap between the west and east of the country .
cities such as cottbus and rostock still have record unemployment rates .
there was no trace of an upswing .
so there was no question that it was legitimate to call for a reform of the subsidies for the east , the paper wrote and praised the president for his courage in making that point .
but it added that his timing was off .
his controversial and untimely comments came before two local elections and the paper feared that this debate would only strengthen the radical parties .
in düsseldorf , the rheinische post wrote that the agitation in the east was largely over the simple truth expressed by köhler .
it noted that much of the angst was attributed to careless election campaigning .
the indignity and outrage expressed only highlight the truth of köhler ’ s comments , according to the paper .
permanent subsidies corrupt thinking , it noted .
those who received subsidies were like junkies – they could not imagine living without being funded by the state .
but was that a good enough reason for germany to invest in the east more than the americans had into their entire global military presence , asked the paper and concluded that everyone knew that this could n't continue .
die welt in berlin wrote that köhler after his election in may had promised to speak out on political and economic issues .
the need for change in germany had demanded this from the highest office holder of the country .
köhler has now proven this , opined the paper .
but it was surprised over the angry reaction over köhler ’ s comments from the political camps .
it appeared as if the former east had waited for such a signal in order to raise a warning finger to point to the fact that the country was not unified , according to the paper .
such messages are not new and this was evidenced in the weekly demonstrations , wrote the daily , admonishing germans to overcome the split in society .
this was the central message of köhler ’ s inaugural speech .
the president has shown the need for honesty , the paper concluded .
the stuttgarter nachrichten wrote that the president would have to explain himself .
his comments on the economic disparities between the east and west raised questions about the country ’ s constitution .
the paper said the issue was not equality but on how the country could be rearranged to help the weaker regions . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 unanimity slows eu response in sudan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu must decide in unison how to help sudanese refugees lack of agreement keeps the eu from flexing its foreign policy muscles .
that is especially apparent in darfur 's humanitarian catastrophe , which has ministers " extremely concerned " but unable to enforce any action . while the un estimates that more than 50,000 people have been killed with another 1.2 million sudanese forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers have expressed their concern about a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word genocide has not been uttered by any of the eu 's foreign ministers , who will discuss the darfur situation at their monthly meeting monday .
they know how they label the situation will determine their next actions - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps demanded by their un obligation to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister fischer , left , met with sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in july " we need to keep up the pressure , " german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if the international community had not reacted so strongly , the humanitarian situation , which had potential to lead to genocide , would be much worse than today 's deplorable reality . "
the pressure was first put on in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can achieve because hesitance in italy , spain and greece keeps the eu from being able to demand stronger action .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition to the situation , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 1.2 million sudanese have been driven from their homes " i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .
" they know how to read the contradictory signs that were given by the international community in dealing politically with this issue . "
the eu 's mixed signals may come to an end when the ministers ' meeting ends , one high-ranking german official in brussels told germany 's wdr radio station : they may agree to send 25 police to the region . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de no help in the pipeline despite international condemnation , renewed fighting is being reported in darfur , sudan .
a european parliament delegation returning from the crisis area is calling for more aid and increased pressure to end the conflict .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .

it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .
scientists think human tissue produced from embryonic stem cells could be used to treat alzheimer 's , diabetes and other illnesses .
stem cells are non-specialized cells that can produce mature specialized cells . liberal states may attract scientists , families bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will " designer babies " start a boom in bio tourism ?
last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .
but the cdu deputy group leader maria böhmer has strongly rejected the idea . ulrich kasparick , a permanent secretary to the federal research ministry , said the ministry saw no need for action .

at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .

germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .

people in bed with someone who snores do n't only suffer when their partner is sleeping : they also do n't have as much sex as silent sleepers and when it happens it 's not as good . all the problems snorers , especially middle-aged men , have in bed come down to sleep apnea .

the drugs used to treat the problem also do their part in taking the fun out of sex .
people suffering from sleep apnea are often tired , which drives down their desire for sex .
while the side effects of drugs available to treat the condition often lead to declines in sexual performance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 spain gets back to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero : re-orienting spanish policy toward the world spanish prime minister zapatero is meeting with his german and french counterparts in madrid on monday , a further step in fine-tuning spain 's relationship to europe . spain is in the news again .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .
" the spanish government says : ' if we behave like proper europeans , we have better chances of getting support for structural funds . " re-orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers from the plus ultra ii brigade who were based in iraq , disembark with a spanish flag with a bull printed on it on arrival at a spanish military base in talavera la real , western spain on april 20 , 2004 after they were relieved by another contingent of troops .
donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .
" it 's disappeared into a no man 's land - from the viewpoint of the franco-german axis . spain may be less visible now , but that 's only because it 's less vocal , not less important , manuel ecuvero , a macro-economic and international political analyst at instituto de empresa , spain 's leading business school , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission headquarters in brussels but spain has no leverage to prevent an end to its brussels cash flow , ecuvero said .
spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .
berlin , in particular , one of the countries that pays the highest per capita contribution to the eu , has made clear that that amount should decrease . " more and more there is the certainty that the structural funds will run out and we will have to stand on our own , " ecuvero conceded . no longer upside-down madrid has indeed changed its policies toward the eu under zapatero , including cultivating relations to france and germany .
but according to ecuvero , the aim was n't to create an overt alliance . " aznar turned traditional spanish international relations upside-down , " he said .
" we are refocusing our policy toward europe , toward latin america , toward the world .
zapatero is recovering the lines that spanish foreign policy has pursued for 50 years .

in slovenia , for example , it is called ' evro ' .
latvians - if and when they join the common currency - will pay with ' eiro ' and in hungary , the word has an accent .
this contravenes a regulation drawn up by eu leaders in 1997 that the word must be spelled ' euro ' in all official languages .
greece , however , is exempt because it has a different alphabet .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said , " we were surprised to find that this problem existed , but we solved it , " joking , " you see how decisive finance ministers can sometimes be . "
however , he was flummoxed by a question asking what form the plural should take .
some use ' euro ' , others ' euros . '
the problem is unlikely to arise in the new member states for a few years .
although all ten new entrants to the eu club are treaty-bound to join the single currency , none is likely to do so before 2007 .

latvians - if and when they join the common currency - will pay with ' eiro ' and in hungary , the word has an accent .
this contravenes a regulation drawn up by eu leaders in 1997 that the word must be spelled ' euro ' in all official languages .
greece , however , is exempt because it has a different alphabet .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said , " we were surprised to find that this problem existed , but we solved it , " joking , " you see how decisive finance ministers can sometimes be . "
however , he was flummoxed by a question asking what form the plural should take .
some use ' euro ' , others ' euros . '
the problem is unlikely to arise in the new member states for a few years .
although all ten new entrants to the eu club are treaty-bound to join the single currency , none is likely to do so before 2007 .

however , the top slot and the unbeaten run were relinquished on the road as mainz pulled off a 2-0 victory over the early season pace setters . four days before the start of their champions league campaign against real madrid , leverkusen were chopped down , first by niclas weiland who put promoted mainz in front from a swift counter-attack in the 65th minute before fellow striker benjamin auer doubled their lead with a superb shot from the edge of box three minutes later . another team warming up for champions league action was bayern munich .
happily for the bavarians , their visit to maccabi tel aviv will come on the back of a victory courtesy of dutch striker roy makaay , who raced into the box unchallenged to score on 26 minutes to score the only and deciding goal in the game with arminia bielefeld . bayern , who climb five places to fifth , failed to shine but at least bounced back from the heavy defeat by leverkusen in their previous league outing . dortmund miss out in ruhr derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the showpiece ruhr valley derby , borussia dortmund failed to beat bochum in an eventful match because of an own goal by french defender guy demel in the 75th minute .
cameroon defender raymond kalla put bochum ahead on 15 minutes when he headed home from close range but the visitors equalized three minutes into the second half courtesy of another headed goal , this time from giant czech striker jan koller . dortmund goalkeeper guillaume warmuz then saved a penalty from denmark striker peter madsen in the 56th minute .
a header by brazilian striker ewerthon put dortmund 2-1 up three minutes later and dortmund looked to have secured victory before demel 's aberration made the final score 2-2 . one of the shocks of the weekend came at the borussia park where mönchengladbach beat champions werder bremen 3-1 to hand out the title holders their second consecutive defeat just three days before a visit to inter milan in their first ever champions league outing . champions defeated again czech forward marek heinz opened the scoring for the home side with a header from a corner on 11 minutes , an advantage which was then doubled by oliver neuville in the 53rd .
substitute striker nelson valdez restored hope for werder in the 69th minute but mönchengladbach held on for their first win of the season completed by substitute vladimir ivic in stoppage time . schalke 04 's miserable season continued at wolfsburg where the royal blues went down 3-0 , courtesy of two goals from bulgaria midfielder marian hristov and argentine striker diego klimowicz .
hristov opened the scoring with a header from a free kick in the 30th minute and doubled the advantage in similar fashion 10 minutes later .
klimowicz rounded off the win on the stroke of full time .

providing subsidies to bridge those differences , particularly in the six eastern states , would burden the younger generation with very high debts . " there were and are everywhere in the republic large differences in living standards , " köhler was quoted as saying .
" if you want to level them out , you cement the subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the young generation .
we must get away from the subsidized state .

under a so-called " solidarity pact " that expires in 2020 , billions of euros are being transferred east in a bid to equalize living standards . a special government-appointed commission recently concluded on the state of the eastern german economy and how difficult it will be to bring it up to western german levels .
the report said the massive injection of more than € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 trillion -rrb- , into the eastern states since 1990 has not created jobs or helped to create a new manufacturing base . remarks fuel growing debate köhler 's comments come at a time when protests against a government drive to trim social programs , in particular a new law that will cut benefits for the long-term jobless , are stoking seething resentment in the eastern states .
the interview also comes just days after a report that suggested every fourth western german and every eighth eastern german wanted a return of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an election poster for the rightextremist national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- against the government 's social welfare reforms his remarks , made a week before voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony go to the polls to elect state governments are likely to be exploited by the far-right parties as well as the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the east german communist party .
the reform proposals have been seized on by opposition parties , eager to fight the debate on an apparent east-west divide . the ruling social democrats have already experienced the backlash of public opinion , tasting resounding defeat in the regional elections in the western state of saarland , as citizens of the eastern regions fight back against the welfare reforms which will affect them the most . schröder calls on one country , one people in response to köhler 's remarks , chancellor gerhard schröder told inforadio berlin-brandenburg : " we are one country , one people and we must do politics for all of germany . " christoph matschie , the spd leader in the eastern german state of thuringia , told the international herald tribune that köhler had " instigated a highly dangerous debate , " adding it would strengthen feelings in the western states that the east germans have had enough financial support . reactions suggest concern wolfgang böhmer , the premier of the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , said the constitution itself stipulates the goal of bringing poorer states up to the average standard of the more well-off ones , implying köhler was questioning those principles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck at a party conference in august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.09.2004 germany 's ethics council rejects cloning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will continue to oppose human cloning for research the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits . the german national ethics council , the 25-member body created in 2001 by the federal government to offer advice on ethical issues in the life sciences , announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research .
the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .
" even though the bundestag has clearly said ' no ' to therapeutic cloning , it is now time to readdress , and discuss the issue in a more precise and differentiated way , " spiros simitis said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper last month after the council debated the issue in berlin . council divided on cloning topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells .
it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .
scientists think human tissue produced from embryonic stem cells could be used to treat alzheimer 's , diabetes and other illnesses .
stem cells are non-specialized cells that can produce mature specialized cells . liberal states may attract scientists , families bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will " designer babies " start a boom in bio tourism ?
last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .
but the cdu deputy group leader maria böhmer has strongly rejected the idea . ulrich kasparick , a permanent secretary to the federal research ministry , said the ministry saw no need for action . " there is no majority for changing the ban on cloning , " he told the faz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " designer baby " gets go-ahead a couple in northern ireland have been given permission to proceed with a controversial stem-cell therapy which could save their young son .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .
" even though the bundestag has clearly said ' no ' to therapeutic cloning , it is now time to readdress , and discuss the issue in a more precise and differentiated way , " spiros simitis said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper last month after the council debated the issue in berlin . council divided on cloning topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells .
it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .
scientists think human tissue produced from embryonic stem cells could be used to treat alzheimer 's , diabetes and other illnesses .
stem cells are non-specialized cells that can produce mature specialized cells . liberal states may attract scientists , families bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will " designer babies " start a boom in bio tourism ?
last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .
but the cdu deputy group leader maria böhmer has strongly rejected the idea . ulrich kasparick , a permanent secretary to the federal research ministry , said the ministry saw no need for action . " there is no majority for changing the ban on cloning , " he told the faz . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " designer baby " gets go-ahead a couple in northern ireland have been given permission to proceed with a controversial stem-cell therapy which could save their young son .

do n't even ask großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bloggers from around the world participate in the bobs awards starting on sept .
17 , you may be asking yourself : " what the heck is a weblog ? "
konstantin klein gives his answer here . here 's a tip : just do n't ask anyone what a blog actually is .
the chances are good that you wo n't get any smarter from the answer .
because you 'll likely either ask someone who has never heard the term before and frankly admits that , or you 'll ask someone who has his or her own blog .
that 's even worse .
but let 's just get to the facts .
" blog " is a term that first began to appear on english web sites in the late nineties .
it melts together the words " web " as in internet and " log " as in book .
in other words , it 's a logbook of a person journeying through the world wide web .
bloggers log interesting observations from their journeys in the log and because the same log is available on the net , anyone can read it .
in order to give the reader something to observe , too , links referring to the subject of the log should also be included - mostly to other web sites , and the link is no problem .
in order to make a web log a weblog , the entries also have to be updated - just like a logbook .
see , that was n't so hard !
the real problem starts with the web loggers .
because they are , even if they would try to distance themselves from disgust or indignation , not really any different from other people with hobbies , like golf gti collectors or postage stamp collectors or dachshund enthusiasts .
in other words : they have their own way of producing a weblog , washing a gti , peeling off a stamp or feeding a dachshund .
they know what they 're doing , and everyone else is just an amateur .
but do n't let anyone know where you got that from !
the consequences are bad enough .
not only because a holy war has practically developed in the german-speaking world over whether to they should be called " weblogs " or whether they should be called " blogs " -lrb- but here 's an insider tip : it 's called a " weblog " ! -rrb- , or whether a weblog must have a certain number of links in order to differentiate itself from a web diary -lrb- insider tip : i have no idea ! -rrb- or whether a web diary can even be called a weblog !
-lrb- insider tip : no !
of course !
never !
but surely !
absolutely never ! & % $ $ # @ $ * * & % $ & $ @ ! -rrb- .
in addition , there 's also the technical discussion about whether a weblog should be produced using blogging software , in the homelike surroundings of a blogger community , or whether it would be better to have individually installed and customized technology that runs , if possible , off a person 's own server .
unwritten weblog rules and finally , there are unwritten rules for bloggers that require a little self-confidence to break .
to a certain extent , every weblog has to feature pictures of cats every week and they have to link at least once a week to an article that either proves or refutes the idea that weblogs are the form of " grassroots journalism . "
they have to be redesigned at least twice a year , and at least once a year they need to be closed again due to apathy .
but fortunately that 's all a bit exaggerated - even if only a little bit .
for weblogs are nothing more than regularly updated , very subjective , often demonically funny , sometimes even literary and not too seldom political web sites that are made , cultivated and written by individualists who have something to say and , for the most part , can express themselves well .
weblogs are not news sources .
instead they offer commentary about the world and the personal state of the author .
and in this sense , it 's also true that they are hyperventilating , hyper-babble of the hyper - the simplest , fastest and cheapest possibility to reach an audience of millions .
theoretically ... ... because the success of a weblog is quite dependent on the abilities of the writer .
if you want to try yourself , but do n't know anything about the technology at work backstage in your web browser , then you can also attempt it by opening up an account at services like blogger.com , typepad.com or salon.com.
if you 've already heard of html and do n't mistake ftp for a german political party , then you can also set up an account with a webhoster , install a program like moveabletype.org , pmachine.com -lrb- both available free in their simplest versions -rrb- , nucleuscms.org , wordpress.org or textpattern.com and just start typing .

do n't even ask großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bloggers from around the world participate in the bobs awards starting on sept .
17 , you may be asking yourself : " what the heck is a weblog ? "
konstantin klein gives his answer here . here 's a tip : just do n't ask anyone what a blog actually is .
the chances are good that you wo n't get any smarter from the answer .
because you 'll likely either ask someone who has never heard the term before and frankly admits that , or you 'll ask someone who has his or her own blog .
that 's even worse .
but let 's just get to the facts .
" blog " is a term that first began to appear on english web sites in the late nineties .
it melts together the words " web " as in internet and " log " as in book .
in other words , it 's a logbook of a person journeying through the world wide web .
bloggers log interesting observations from their journeys in the log and because the same log is available on the net , anyone can read it .
in order to give the reader something to observe , too , links referring to the subject of the log should also be included - mostly to other web sites , and the link is no problem .
in order to make a web log a weblog , the entries also have to be updated - just like a logbook .
see , that was n't so hard !
the real problem starts with the web loggers .
because they are , even if they would try to distance themselves from disgust or indignation , not really any different from other people with hobbies , like golf gti collectors or postage stamp collectors or dachshund enthusiasts .
in other words : they have their own way of producing a weblog , washing a gti , peeling off a stamp or feeding a dachshund .
they know what they 're doing , and everyone else is just an amateur .
but do n't let anyone know where you got that from !
the consequences are bad enough .
not only because a holy war has practically developed in the german-speaking world over whether to they should be called " weblogs " or whether they should be called " blogs " -lrb- but here 's an insider tip : it 's called a " weblog " ! -rrb- , or whether a weblog must have a certain number of links in order to differentiate itself from a web diary -lrb- insider tip : i have no idea ! -rrb- or whether a web diary can even be called a weblog !
-lrb- insider tip : no !
of course !
never !
but surely !
absolutely never ! & % $ $ # @ $ * * & % $ & $ @ ! -rrb- .
in addition , there 's also the technical discussion about whether a weblog should be produced using blogging software , in the homelike surroundings of a blogger community , or whether it would be better to have individually installed and customized technology that runs , if possible , off a person 's own server .
unwritten weblog rules and finally , there are unwritten rules for bloggers that require a little self-confidence to break .
to a certain extent , every weblog has to feature pictures of cats every week and they have to link at least once a week to an article that either proves or refutes the idea that weblogs are the form of " grassroots journalism . "
they have to be redesigned at least twice a year , and at least once a year they need to be closed again due to apathy .
but fortunately that 's all a bit exaggerated - even if only a little bit .
for weblogs are nothing more than regularly updated , very subjective , often demonically funny , sometimes even literary and not too seldom political web sites that are made , cultivated and written by individualists who have something to say and , for the most part , can express themselves well .
weblogs are not news sources .
instead they offer commentary about the world and the personal state of the author .
and in this sense , it 's also true that they are hyperventilating , hyper-babble of the hyper - the simplest , fastest and cheapest possibility to reach an audience of millions .
theoretically ... ... because the success of a weblog is quite dependent on the abilities of the writer .
if you want to try yourself , but do n't know anything about the technology at work backstage in your web browser , then you can also attempt it by opening up an account at services like blogger.com , typepad.com or salon.com.
if you 've already heard of html and do n't mistake ftp for a german political party , then you can also set up an account with a webhoster , install a program like moveabletype.org , pmachine.com -lrb- both available free in their simplest versions -rrb- , nucleuscms.org , wordpress.org or textpattern.com and just start typing .
once your weblog -lrb- not blog -rrb- is up and running , nothing more will be standing in the way of your career as a one man or one woman media company . konstantin klein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the bobs official web site the official site of the 2004 deutsche welle international weblog awards 9797 picture of the day © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

people in bed with someone who snores do n't only suffer when their partner is sleeping : they also do n't have as much sex as silent sleepers and when it happens it 's not as good . all the problems snorers , especially middle-aged men , have in bed come down to sleep apnea .
it 's the condition that causes people to stop breathing for a short time and wake up .
the drugs used to treat the problem also do their part in taking the fun out of sex .
people suffering from sleep apnea are often tired , which drives down their desire for sex .
while the side effects of drugs available to treat the condition often lead to declines in sexual performance .
" more than half of sleep apnea patients complain of loss of libido , " martin konermann , a medical professor at the university of kassel told the senioren ratgeber , a magazine given out free in germany 's pharmacies .
" that 's 10 times more than in the rest of the population . "

however , the top slot and the unbeaten run were relinquished on the road as mainz pulled off a 2-0 victory over the early season pace setters . four days before the start of their champions league campaign against real madrid , leverkusen were chopped down , first by niclas weiland who put promoted mainz in front from a swift counter-attack in the 65th minute before fellow striker benjamin auer doubled their lead with a superb shot from the edge of box three minutes later . another team warming up for champions league action was bayern munich .
happily for the bavarians , their visit to maccabi tel aviv will come on the back of a victory courtesy of dutch striker roy makaay , who raced into the box unchallenged to score on 26 minutes to score the only and deciding goal in the game with arminia bielefeld . bayern , who climb five places to fifth , failed to shine but at least bounced back from the heavy defeat by leverkusen in their previous league outing . dortmund miss out in ruhr derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the showpiece ruhr valley derby , borussia dortmund failed to beat bochum in an eventful match because of an own goal by french defender guy demel in the 75th minute .
cameroon defender raymond kalla put bochum ahead on 15 minutes when he headed home from close range but the visitors equalized three minutes into the second half courtesy of another headed goal , this time from giant czech striker jan koller . dortmund goalkeeper guillaume warmuz then saved a penalty from denmark striker peter madsen in the 56th minute .
a header by brazilian striker ewerthon put dortmund 2-1 up three minutes later and dortmund looked to have secured victory before demel 's aberration made the final score 2-2 . one of the shocks of the weekend came at the borussia park where mönchengladbach beat champions werder bremen 3-1 to hand out the title holders their second consecutive defeat just three days before a visit to inter milan in their first ever champions league outing . champions defeated again czech forward marek heinz opened the scoring for the home side with a header from a corner on 11 minutes , an advantage which was then doubled by oliver neuville in the 53rd .
substitute striker nelson valdez restored hope for werder in the 69th minute but mönchengladbach held on for their first win of the season completed by substitute vladimir ivic in stoppage time . schalke 04 's miserable season continued at wolfsburg where the royal blues went down 3-0 , courtesy of two goals from bulgaria midfielder marian hristov and argentine striker diego klimowicz .
hristov opened the scoring with a header from a free kick in the 30th minute and doubled the advantage in similar fashion 10 minutes later .
klimowicz rounded off the win on the stroke of full time .
wolfsburg 's convincing victory lifted them up to second place , just one point off the lead . stuttgart take pole position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of them at the top of the league sits stuttgart after a 2-0 victory over hamburg , whose own mini revival came to an end and went back to heading in the opposite direction , sliding back to fourth from bottom .
an early goal from midfielder silvio meissner and a late one by hungary striker imre szabics were enough to secure the points and top slot in the bundesliga . hertha berlin had to be content with their fourth draw from as many games after a dull match with few highlights against nuremburg in the other game played on saturday . surprise package freiburg extended their unbeaten run to four games by recovering from two goals down to share the points in the 2-2 draw with hanover on sunday .
two goals from czech striker jiri stajner gave hanover a 2-0 lead after just eight minutes but freiburg responded after the break with goals from strikers regis dorn and ellery cairo . long haul north yields three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern fans finally have something to cheer about .
in the other sunday game , kaiserslautern moved off the bottom and made coach kurt jara 's position slightly more comfortable with their first victory of the season as they beat hansa rostock 2-3 in the northern germany .
the four-time champions led 3-0 after first-half goals from defender thomas drescher and midfielder thomas riedl and one after the interval by striker halil altintop . rostock , still waiting for their first home win , reduced the arrears with two late goals from sweden striker marcus allback . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de action packed ruhr derby ends in draw vfl bochum drew with borussia dortmund in a classic ruhr valley derby on saturday 2-2 .

however , the top slot and the unbeaten run were relinquished on the road as mainz pulled off a 2-0 victory over the early season pace setters . four days before the start of their champions league campaign against real madrid , leverkusen were chopped down , first by niclas weiland who put promoted mainz in front from a swift counter-attack in the 65th minute before fellow striker benjamin auer doubled their lead with a superb shot from the edge of box three minutes later . another team warming up for champions league action was bayern munich .
happily for the bavarians , their visit to maccabi tel aviv will come on the back of a victory courtesy of dutch striker roy makaay , who raced into the box unchallenged to score on 26 minutes to score the only and deciding goal in the game with arminia bielefeld . bayern , who climb five places to fifth , failed to shine but at least bounced back from the heavy defeat by leverkusen in their previous league outing . dortmund miss out in ruhr derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the showpiece ruhr valley derby , borussia dortmund failed to beat bochum in an eventful match because of an own goal by french defender guy demel in the 75th minute .

a header by brazilian striker ewerthon put dortmund 2-1 up three minutes later and dortmund looked to have secured victory before demel 's aberration made the final score 2-2 . one of the shocks of the weekend came at the borussia park where mönchengladbach beat champions werder bremen 3-1 to hand out the title holders their second consecutive defeat just three days before a visit to inter milan in their first ever champions league outing . champions defeated again czech forward marek heinz opened the scoring for the home side with a header from a corner on 11 minutes , an advantage which was then doubled by oliver neuville in the 53rd .
substitute striker nelson valdez restored hope for werder in the 69th minute but mönchengladbach held on for their first win of the season completed by substitute vladimir ivic in stoppage time . schalke 04 's miserable season continued at wolfsburg where the royal blues went down 3-0 , courtesy of two goals from bulgaria midfielder marian hristov and argentine striker diego klimowicz .
hristov opened the scoring with a header from a free kick in the 30th minute and doubled the advantage in similar fashion 10 minutes later .
klimowicz rounded off the win on the stroke of full time .

an early goal from midfielder silvio meissner and a late one by hungary striker imre szabics were enough to secure the points and top slot in the bundesliga . hertha berlin had to be content with their fourth draw from as many games after a dull match with few highlights against nuremburg in the other game played on saturday . surprise package freiburg extended their unbeaten run to four games by recovering from two goals down to share the points in the 2-2 draw with hanover on sunday .
two goals from czech striker jiri stajner gave hanover a 2-0 lead after just eight minutes but freiburg responded after the break with goals from strikers regis dorn and ellery cairo . long haul north yields three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern fans finally have something to cheer about .
in the other sunday game , kaiserslautern moved off the bottom and made coach kurt jara 's position slightly more comfortable with their first victory of the season as they beat hansa rostock 2-3 in the northern germany .
the four-time champions led 3-0 after first-half goals from defender thomas drescher and midfielder thomas riedl and one after the interval by striker halil altintop . rostock , still waiting for their first home win , reduced the arrears with two late goals from sweden striker marcus allback . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de action packed ruhr derby ends in draw vfl bochum drew with borussia dortmund in a classic ruhr valley derby on saturday 2-2 .

at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and the sudanese foriegn minister mostafa osman ismail in khartoum on july 12 , 2004 .
germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .

at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .

germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .
" even though the bundestag has clearly said ' no ' to therapeutic cloning , it is now time to readdress , and discuss the issue in a more precise and differentiated way , " spiros simitis said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper last month after the council debated the issue in berlin . council divided on cloning topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells .
it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .
scientists think human tissue produced from embryonic stem cells could be used to treat alzheimer 's , diabetes and other illnesses .
stem cells are non-specialized cells that can produce mature specialized cells . liberal states may attract scientists , families bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will " designer babies " start a boom in bio tourism ?
last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .
but the cdu deputy group leader maria böhmer has strongly rejected the idea . ulrich kasparick , a permanent secretary to the federal research ministry , said the ministry saw no need for action .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .
11 this year . eight days after the british passed a law that allowed the cloning of human embryos for research purposes , the chairman of national ethics council called on the government to revive the debate on therapeutic cloning .
" even though the bundestag has clearly said ' no ' to therapeutic cloning , it is now time to readdress , and discuss the issue in a more precise and differentiated way , " spiros simitis said in an interview with the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper last month after the council debated the issue in berlin . council divided on cloning topic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : embryonic stem cells .
it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .
scientists think human tissue produced from embryonic stem cells could be used to treat alzheimer 's , diabetes and other illnesses .
stem cells are non-specialized cells that can produce mature specialized cells . liberal states may attract scientists , families bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will " designer babies " start a boom in bio tourism ?
last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .

providing subsidies to bridge those differences , particularly in the six eastern states , would burden the younger generation with very high debts . " there were and are everywhere in the republic large differences in living standards , " köhler was quoted as saying .
" if you want to level them out , you cement the subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the young generation .
we must get away from the subsidized state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apartment complex in the marzahn neighborhood in eastern berlin nearly 15 years after the berlin wall fell , unemployment in the eastern states is more than twice the level in the western part of the country .
under a so-called " solidarity pact " that expires in 2020 , billions of euros are being transferred east in a bid to equalize living standards . a special government-appointed commission recently concluded on the state of the eastern german economy and how difficult it will be to bring it up to western german levels .
the report said the massive injection of more than € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 trillion -rrb- , into the eastern states since 1990 has not created jobs or helped to create a new manufacturing base . remarks fuel growing debate köhler 's comments come at a time when protests against a government drive to trim social programs , in particular a new law that will cut benefits for the long-term jobless , are stoking seething resentment in the eastern states .

but the word genocide has not been uttered by any of the eu 's foreign ministers , who will discuss the darfur situation at their monthly meeting monday .

the paper wrote that new ideas such as education or child care , medical services or care for the elderly are needed in the sparsely populated regions in eastern germany .
looking towards spain or scandinavia could help , according to the daily : there people had similar problems to solve , it concluded .
the südkurier in constance pointed out that the german president had only expressed what had long been a reality .
the billions of euros worth of subsidies poured into east for its development would n't bridge the prosperity gap between the west and east of the country .
cities such as cottbus and rostock still have record unemployment rates .
there was no trace of an upswing .
so there was no question that it was legitimate to call for a reform of the subsidies for the east , the paper wrote and praised the president for his courage in making that point .
but it added that his timing was off .
his controversial and untimely comments came before two local elections and the paper feared that this debate would only strengthen the radical parties .
in düsseldorf , the rheinische post wrote that the agitation in the east was largely over the simple truth expressed by köhler .
it noted that much of the angst was attributed to careless election campaigning .
the indignity and outrage expressed only highlight the truth of köhler ’ s comments , according to the paper .
permanent subsidies corrupt thinking , it noted .
those who received subsidies were like junkies – they could not imagine living without being funded by the state .
but was that a good enough reason for germany to invest in the east more than the americans had into their entire global military presence , asked the paper and concluded that everyone knew that this could n't continue .
die welt in berlin wrote that köhler after his election in may had promised to speak out on political and economic issues .
the need for change in germany had demanded this from the highest office holder of the country .
köhler has now proven this , opined the paper .
but it was surprised over the angry reaction over köhler ’ s comments from the political camps .
it appeared as if the former east had waited for such a signal in order to raise a warning finger to point to the fact that the country was not unified , according to the paper .
such messages are not new and this was evidenced in the weekly demonstrations , wrote the daily , admonishing germans to overcome the split in society .
this was the central message of köhler ’ s inaugural speech .
the president has shown the need for honesty , the paper concluded .
the stuttgarter nachrichten wrote that the president would have to explain himself .
his comments on the economic disparities between the east and west raised questions about the country ’ s constitution .

the paper wrote that new ideas such as education or child care , medical services or care for the elderly are needed in the sparsely populated regions in eastern germany .
looking towards spain or scandinavia could help , according to the daily : there people had similar problems to solve , it concluded .
the südkurier in constance pointed out that the german president had only expressed what had long been a reality .
the billions of euros worth of subsidies poured into east for its development would n't bridge the prosperity gap between the west and east of the country .
cities such as cottbus and rostock still have record unemployment rates .
there was no trace of an upswing .
so there was no question that it was legitimate to call for a reform of the subsidies for the east , the paper wrote and praised the president for his courage in making that point .
but it added that his timing was off .
his controversial and untimely comments came before two local elections and the paper feared that this debate would only strengthen the radical parties .
in düsseldorf , the rheinische post wrote that the agitation in the east was largely over the simple truth expressed by köhler .
it noted that much of the angst was attributed to careless election campaigning .
the indignity and outrage expressed only highlight the truth of köhler ’ s comments , according to the paper .

those who received subsidies were like junkies – they could not imagine living without being funded by the state .
but was that a good enough reason for germany to invest in the east more than the americans had into their entire global military presence , asked the paper and concluded that everyone knew that this could n't continue .
die welt in berlin wrote that köhler after his election in may had promised to speak out on political and economic issues .
the need for change in germany had demanded this from the highest office holder of the country .
köhler has now proven this , opined the paper .
but it was surprised over the angry reaction over köhler ’ s comments from the political camps .
it appeared as if the former east had waited for such a signal in order to raise a warning finger to point to the fact that the country was not unified , according to the paper .
such messages are not new and this was evidenced in the weekly demonstrations , wrote the daily , admonishing germans to overcome the split in society .
this was the central message of köhler ’ s inaugural speech .
the president has shown the need for honesty , the paper concluded .
the stuttgarter nachrichten wrote that the president would have to explain himself .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "
playing the same game ?
" it 's always the same " , a british diplomat recently complained .
" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .
the united states , frustrated with iran 's tug-of-war , signaled that time was running out for iran to cooperate with the international community .
meanwhile , europe antagonized the us by lobbying for more negotiations and rejecting proposals to pass the matter along to the un security council .
this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .
in the last several months , iran has also proven less open to europe 's diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed el baradei , secretary general iaea a european draft resolution , proposed by britain , france and germany , could call on iaea secretary general mohamed el baradei -lrb- photo -rrb- to file a report before the next board meeting in november and make a " definite determination on whether or not further steps are required , " a diplomat close to iaea told afp .
rather than threatening with an ultimatum and sanctions as the us has suggested , such a time frame would once again give iran the chance to modify its nuclear policies over the next two months and avoid a full confrontation with the united states .
but should iran pass up this last chance , they may not find a willing advocate for further negotiations in the europe - that is if eu foreign ministers back-up monday 's tough talk with tough actions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "
playing the same game ?
" it 's always the same " , a british diplomat recently complained .
" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .
the united states , frustrated with iran 's tug-of-war , signaled that time was running out for iran to cooperate with the international community .
meanwhile , europe antagonized the us by lobbying for more negotiations and rejecting proposals to pass the matter along to the un security council .
this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .
in the last several months , iran has also proven less open to europe 's diplomacy .

rather than threatening with an ultimatum and sanctions as the us has suggested , such a time frame would once again give iran the chance to modify its nuclear policies over the next two months and avoid a full confrontation with the united states .

people in bed with someone who snores do n't only suffer when their partner is sleeping : they also do n't have as much sex as silent sleepers and when it happens it 's not as good . all the problems snorers , especially middle-aged men , have in bed come down to sleep apnea .

people suffering from sleep apnea are often tired , which drives down their desire for sex .
while the side effects of drugs available to treat the condition often lead to declines in sexual performance .

however , the top slot and the unbeaten run were relinquished on the road as mainz pulled off a 2-0 victory over the early season pace setters . four days before the start of their champions league campaign against real madrid , leverkusen were chopped down , first by niclas weiland who put promoted mainz in front from a swift counter-attack in the 65th minute before fellow striker benjamin auer doubled their lead with a superb shot from the edge of box three minutes later . another team warming up for champions league action was bayern munich .
happily for the bavarians , their visit to maccabi tel aviv will come on the back of a victory courtesy of dutch striker roy makaay , who raced into the box unchallenged to score on 26 minutes to score the only and deciding goal in the game with arminia bielefeld . bayern , who climb five places to fifth , failed to shine but at least bounced back from the heavy defeat by leverkusen in their previous league outing . dortmund miss out in ruhr derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the showpiece ruhr valley derby , borussia dortmund failed to beat bochum in an eventful match because of an own goal by french defender guy demel in the 75th minute .

people in bed with someone who snores do n't only suffer when their partner is sleeping : they also do n't have as much sex as silent sleepers and when it happens it 's not as good . all the problems snorers , especially middle-aged men , have in bed come down to sleep apnea .
it 's the condition that causes people to stop breathing for a short time and wake up .
the drugs used to treat the problem also do their part in taking the fun out of sex .
people suffering from sleep apnea are often tired , which drives down their desire for sex .
while the side effects of drugs available to treat the condition often lead to declines in sexual performance .
" more than half of sleep apnea patients complain of loss of libido , " martin konermann , a medical professor at the university of kassel told the senioren ratgeber , a magazine given out free in germany 's pharmacies .
" that 's 10 times more than in the rest of the population . "
tired , unsatisfied partners still have one recourse : a breathing mask that can help get a good night 's sleep , which in turn drives the libido back up .
the easy-to-remove headgear is not known to influence the libido . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can you really judge a man by his car ?

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .

it was clear at the time that stances varied considerably across the 25-member council , which includes scientists , theologians , business executives and trade union representatives , and the publication of the statement was put off until september .
but the council , which has no legislative power , made clear that the statement on monday was far from unanimously supported . the debate in germany is likely to continue .
reproductive human cloning is illegal in most countries but in some , including sweden , canada , the united states and belgium , the cloning of human embryos is allowed if the purpose is to conduct research on diseases .

last week it became known that a couple from northern ireland had been given permission to pursue the process of producing an embryo whose cells could eventually help their three-year-old son recover from a potentially deadly blood disease .
if the process proves to be a success , simitis warned that a type of " bio tourism " might develop within the eu and that german researchers would emigrate to britain if germany did not rethink its stance .
the spokeswoman for research policy of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- parliamentary group , katharina reiche , and the libreal fdp 's expert on bioethics , ulrike flach , have both gone on the record expressing support for a new debate .

the announcement , which came after more than a year of study , reinforces a vote taken by the german parliament in 2002 that outlaws cloning . human embryo cloning for stem cells is illegal in germany , although research from stem cells outside germany has been allowed by the german parliament which first passed a ban on all types of human cloning , be it for reproductive or therapeutic purposes , as far back as 1991 . the national ethics council had been set the task of investigating the nature of stem cell research by chancellor gerhard schröder in late 2002 .
the subject was brought to the fore once again when the british government loosened the restrictions governing human cloning in july and granted its first license for cloning for stem cell research on aug .

at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .

germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .

they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .

germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .

however , the top slot and the unbeaten run were relinquished on the road as mainz pulled off a 2-0 victory over the early season pace setters . four days before the start of their champions league campaign against real madrid , leverkusen were chopped down , first by niclas weiland who put promoted mainz in front from a swift counter-attack in the 65th minute before fellow striker benjamin auer doubled their lead with a superb shot from the edge of box three minutes later . another team warming up for champions league action was bayern munich .
happily for the bavarians , their visit to maccabi tel aviv will come on the back of a victory courtesy of dutch striker roy makaay , who raced into the box unchallenged to score on 26 minutes to score the only and deciding goal in the game with arminia bielefeld . bayern , who climb five places to fifth , failed to shine but at least bounced back from the heavy defeat by leverkusen in their previous league outing . dortmund miss out in ruhr derby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the showpiece ruhr valley derby , borussia dortmund failed to beat bochum in an eventful match because of an own goal by french defender guy demel in the 75th minute .
cameroon defender raymond kalla put bochum ahead on 15 minutes when he headed home from close range but the visitors equalized three minutes into the second half courtesy of another headed goal , this time from giant czech striker jan koller . dortmund goalkeeper guillaume warmuz then saved a penalty from denmark striker peter madsen in the 56th minute .
a header by brazilian striker ewerthon put dortmund 2-1 up three minutes later and dortmund looked to have secured victory before demel 's aberration made the final score 2-2 . one of the shocks of the weekend came at the borussia park where mönchengladbach beat champions werder bremen 3-1 to hand out the title holders their second consecutive defeat just three days before a visit to inter milan in their first ever champions league outing . champions defeated again czech forward marek heinz opened the scoring for the home side with a header from a corner on 11 minutes , an advantage which was then doubled by oliver neuville in the 53rd .
substitute striker nelson valdez restored hope for werder in the 69th minute but mönchengladbach held on for their first win of the season completed by substitute vladimir ivic in stoppage time . schalke 04 's miserable season continued at wolfsburg where the royal blues went down 3-0 , courtesy of two goals from bulgaria midfielder marian hristov and argentine striker diego klimowicz .
hristov opened the scoring with a header from a free kick in the 30th minute and doubled the advantage in similar fashion 10 minutes later .
klimowicz rounded off the win on the stroke of full time .
wolfsburg 's convincing victory lifted them up to second place , just one point off the lead . stuttgart take pole position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just ahead of them at the top of the league sits stuttgart after a 2-0 victory over hamburg , whose own mini revival came to an end and went back to heading in the opposite direction , sliding back to fourth from bottom .
an early goal from midfielder silvio meissner and a late one by hungary striker imre szabics were enough to secure the points and top slot in the bundesliga . hertha berlin had to be content with their fourth draw from as many games after a dull match with few highlights against nuremburg in the other game played on saturday . surprise package freiburg extended their unbeaten run to four games by recovering from two goals down to share the points in the 2-2 draw with hanover on sunday .
two goals from czech striker jiri stajner gave hanover a 2-0 lead after just eight minutes but freiburg responded after the break with goals from strikers regis dorn and ellery cairo . long haul north yields three points bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiserslautern fans finally have something to cheer about .
in the other sunday game , kaiserslautern moved off the bottom and made coach kurt jara 's position slightly more comfortable with their first victory of the season as they beat hansa rostock 2-3 in the northern germany .
the four-time champions led 3-0 after first-half goals from defender thomas drescher and midfielder thomas riedl and one after the interval by striker halil altintop . rostock , still waiting for their first home win , reduced the arrears with two late goals from sweden striker marcus allback . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de action packed ruhr derby ends in draw vfl bochum drew with borussia dortmund in a classic ruhr valley derby on saturday 2-2 .

socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .

donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .

socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .
" the spanish government says : ' if we behave like proper europeans , we have better chances of getting support for structural funds .

donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .
" it 's disappeared into a no man 's land - from the viewpoint of the franco-german axis . spain may be less visible now , but that 's only because it 's less vocal , not less important , manuel ecuvero , a macro-economic and international political analyst at instituto de empresa , spain 's leading business school , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission headquarters in brussels but spain has no leverage to prevent an end to its brussels cash flow , ecuvero said .
spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .
berlin , in particular , one of the countries that pays the highest per capita contribution to the eu , has made clear that that amount should decrease . " more and more there is the certainty that the structural funds will run out and we will have to stand on our own , " ecuvero conceded . no longer upside-down madrid has indeed changed its policies toward the eu under zapatero , including cultivating relations to france and germany .
but according to ecuvero , the aim was n't to create an overt alliance . " aznar turned traditional spanish international relations upside-down , " he said .
" we are refocusing our policy toward europe , toward latin america , toward the world .

providing subsidies to bridge those differences , particularly in the six eastern states , would burden the younger generation with very high debts . " there were and are everywhere in the republic large differences in living standards , " köhler was quoted as saying .
" if you want to level them out , you cement the subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the young generation .
we must get away from the subsidized state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apartment complex in the marzahn neighborhood in eastern berlin nearly 15 years after the berlin wall fell , unemployment in the eastern states is more than twice the level in the western part of the country .
under a so-called " solidarity pact " that expires in 2020 , billions of euros are being transferred east in a bid to equalize living standards . a special government-appointed commission recently concluded on the state of the eastern german economy and how difficult it will be to bring it up to western german levels .
the report said the massive injection of more than € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 trillion -rrb- , into the eastern states since 1990 has not created jobs or helped to create a new manufacturing base . remarks fuel growing debate köhler 's comments come at a time when protests against a government drive to trim social programs , in particular a new law that will cut benefits for the long-term jobless , are stoking seething resentment in the eastern states .
the interview also comes just days after a report that suggested every fourth western german and every eighth eastern german wanted a return of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an election poster for the rightextremist national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- against the government 's social welfare reforms his remarks , made a week before voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony go to the polls to elect state governments are likely to be exploited by the far-right parties as well as the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the east german communist party .
the reform proposals have been seized on by opposition parties , eager to fight the debate on an apparent east-west divide . the ruling social democrats have already experienced the backlash of public opinion , tasting resounding defeat in the regional elections in the western state of saarland , as citizens of the eastern regions fight back against the welfare reforms which will affect them the most . schröder calls on one country , one people in response to köhler 's remarks , chancellor gerhard schröder told inforadio berlin-brandenburg : " we are one country , one people and we must do politics for all of germany . " christoph matschie , the spd leader in the eastern german state of thuringia , told the international herald tribune that köhler had " instigated a highly dangerous debate , " adding it would strengthen feelings in the western states that the east germans have had enough financial support . reactions suggest concern wolfgang böhmer , the premier of the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , said the constitution itself stipulates the goal of bringing poorer states up to the average standard of the more well-off ones , implying köhler was questioning those principles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck at a party conference in august .
matthias platzeck -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the social democratic prime minister of brandenburg who still hopes to continue sharing power with the conservative christian democrats after elections next sunday , said it was " obvious to me there are differences among the regions .
the question is how wide they are . " iris gleicke , a deputy minister for eastern german reconstruction , described the president 's argument in the sächsische zeitung daily as " absurd " while lothar bisky , the leader of the ex-communist pds told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " whether deliberately or not , köhler is questioning special support for the east .

that is especially apparent in darfur 's humanitarian catastrophe , which has ministers " extremely concerned " but unable to enforce any action . while the un estimates that more than 50,000 people have been killed with another 1.2 million sudanese forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers have expressed their concern about a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word genocide has not been uttered by any of the eu 's foreign ministers , who will discuss the darfur situation at their monthly meeting monday .
they know how they label the situation will determine their next actions - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps demanded by their un obligation to stop genocide wherever it occurs .

some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can achieve because hesitance in italy , spain and greece keeps the eu from being able to demand stronger action .

the paper wrote that new ideas such as education or child care , medical services or care for the elderly are needed in the sparsely populated regions in eastern germany .
looking towards spain or scandinavia could help , according to the daily : there people had similar problems to solve , it concluded .
the südkurier in constance pointed out that the german president had only expressed what had long been a reality .
the billions of euros worth of subsidies poured into east for its development would n't bridge the prosperity gap between the west and east of the country .
cities such as cottbus and rostock still have record unemployment rates .
there was no trace of an upswing .
so there was no question that it was legitimate to call for a reform of the subsidies for the east , the paper wrote and praised the president for his courage in making that point .
but it added that his timing was off .
his controversial and untimely comments came before two local elections and the paper feared that this debate would only strengthen the radical parties .
in düsseldorf , the rheinische post wrote that the agitation in the east was largely over the simple truth expressed by köhler .
it noted that much of the angst was attributed to careless election campaigning .
the indignity and outrage expressed only highlight the truth of köhler ’ s comments , according to the paper .
permanent subsidies corrupt thinking , it noted .
those who received subsidies were like junkies – they could not imagine living without being funded by the state .
but was that a good enough reason for germany to invest in the east more than the americans had into their entire global military presence , asked the paper and concluded that everyone knew that this could n't continue .
die welt in berlin wrote that köhler after his election in may had promised to speak out on political and economic issues .
the need for change in germany had demanded this from the highest office holder of the country .
köhler has now proven this , opined the paper .
but it was surprised over the angry reaction over köhler ’ s comments from the political camps .
it appeared as if the former east had waited for such a signal in order to raise a warning finger to point to the fact that the country was not unified , according to the paper .
such messages are not new and this was evidenced in the weekly demonstrations , wrote the daily , admonishing germans to overcome the split in society .
this was the central message of köhler ’ s inaugural speech .
the president has shown the need for honesty , the paper concluded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 european leaders may get tough with iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear plant in iran , scene of the controversy as the iaea met in vienna on monday to discuss iran 's nuclear ambitions , iran announced plans to resume enriching uranium .
meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "
playing the same game ?
" it 's always the same " , a british diplomat recently complained .
" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .
the united states , frustrated with iran 's tug-of-war , signaled that time was running out for iran to cooperate with the international community .
meanwhile , europe antagonized the us by lobbying for more negotiations and rejecting proposals to pass the matter along to the un security council .
this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .
in the last several months , iran has also proven less open to europe 's diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed el baradei , secretary general iaea a european draft resolution , proposed by britain , france and germany , could call on iaea secretary general mohamed el baradei -lrb- photo -rrb- to file a report before the next board meeting in november and make a " definite determination on whether or not further steps are required , " a diplomat close to iaea told afp .
rather than threatening with an ultimatum and sanctions as the us has suggested , such a time frame would once again give iran the chance to modify its nuclear policies over the next two months and avoid a full confrontation with the united states .
but should iran pass up this last chance , they may not find a willing advocate for further negotiations in the europe - that is if eu foreign ministers back-up monday 's tough talk with tough actions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "

" it 's always the same " , a british diplomat recently complained .
" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .
the united states , frustrated with iran 's tug-of-war , signaled that time was running out for iran to cooperate with the international community .
meanwhile , europe antagonized the us by lobbying for more negotiations and rejecting proposals to pass the matter along to the un security council .
this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .
in the last several months , iran has also proven less open to europe 's diplomacy .

rather than threatening with an ultimatum and sanctions as the us has suggested , such a time frame would once again give iran the chance to modify its nuclear policies over the next two months and avoid a full confrontation with the united states .
but should iran pass up this last chance , they may not find a willing advocate for further negotiations in the europe - that is if eu foreign ministers back-up monday 's tough talk with tough actions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .

do n't even ask großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bloggers from around the world participate in the bobs awards starting on sept .
17 , you may be asking yourself : " what the heck is a weblog ? "
konstantin klein gives his answer here . here 's a tip : just do n't ask anyone what a blog actually is .
the chances are good that you wo n't get any smarter from the answer .
because you 'll likely either ask someone who has never heard the term before and frankly admits that , or you 'll ask someone who has his or her own blog .
that 's even worse .
but let 's just get to the facts .
" blog " is a term that first began to appear on english web sites in the late nineties .
it melts together the words " web " as in internet and " log " as in book .
in other words , it 's a logbook of a person journeying through the world wide web .
bloggers log interesting observations from their journeys in the log and because the same log is available on the net , anyone can read it .
in order to give the reader something to observe , too , links referring to the subject of the log should also be included - mostly to other web sites , and the link is no problem .
in order to make a web log a weblog , the entries also have to be updated - just like a logbook .
see , that was n't so hard !
the real problem starts with the web loggers .
because they are , even if they would try to distance themselves from disgust or indignation , not really any different from other people with hobbies , like golf gti collectors or postage stamp collectors or dachshund enthusiasts .
in other words : they have their own way of producing a weblog , washing a gti , peeling off a stamp or feeding a dachshund .
they know what they 're doing , and everyone else is just an amateur .
but do n't let anyone know where you got that from !
the consequences are bad enough .
not only because a holy war has practically developed in the german-speaking world over whether to they should be called " weblogs " or whether they should be called " blogs " -lrb- but here 's an insider tip : it 's called a " weblog " ! -rrb- , or whether a weblog must have a certain number of links in order to differentiate itself from a web diary -lrb- insider tip : i have no idea ! -rrb- or whether a web diary can even be called a weblog !
-lrb- insider tip : no !
of course !
never !
but surely !
absolutely never ! & % $ $ # @ $ * * & % $ & $ @ ! -rrb- .
in addition , there 's also the technical discussion about whether a weblog should be produced using blogging software , in the homelike surroundings of a blogger community , or whether it would be better to have individually installed and customized technology that runs , if possible , off a person 's own server .
unwritten weblog rules and finally , there are unwritten rules for bloggers that require a little self-confidence to break .
to a certain extent , every weblog has to feature pictures of cats every week and they have to link at least once a week to an article that either proves or refutes the idea that weblogs are the form of " grassroots journalism . "
they have to be redesigned at least twice a year , and at least once a year they need to be closed again due to apathy .
but fortunately that 's all a bit exaggerated - even if only a little bit .
for weblogs are nothing more than regularly updated , very subjective , often demonically funny , sometimes even literary and not too seldom political web sites that are made , cultivated and written by individualists who have something to say and , for the most part , can express themselves well .
weblogs are not news sources .
instead they offer commentary about the world and the personal state of the author .
and in this sense , it 's also true that they are hyperventilating , hyper-babble of the hyper - the simplest , fastest and cheapest possibility to reach an audience of millions .
theoretically ... ... because the success of a weblog is quite dependent on the abilities of the writer .
if you want to try yourself , but do n't know anything about the technology at work backstage in your web browser , then you can also attempt it by opening up an account at services like blogger.com , typepad.com or salon.com.

do n't even ask großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bloggers from around the world participate in the bobs awards starting on sept .
17 , you may be asking yourself : " what the heck is a weblog ? "
konstantin klein gives his answer here . here 's a tip : just do n't ask anyone what a blog actually is .
the chances are good that you wo n't get any smarter from the answer .
because you 'll likely either ask someone who has never heard the term before and frankly admits that , or you 'll ask someone who has his or her own blog .
that 's even worse .
but let 's just get to the facts .
" blog " is a term that first began to appear on english web sites in the late nineties .
it melts together the words " web " as in internet and " log " as in book .
in other words , it 's a logbook of a person journeying through the world wide web .
bloggers log interesting observations from their journeys in the log and because the same log is available on the net , anyone can read it .
in order to give the reader something to observe , too , links referring to the subject of the log should also be included - mostly to other web sites , and the link is no problem .
in order to make a web log a weblog , the entries also have to be updated - just like a logbook .
see , that was n't so hard !
the real problem starts with the web loggers .
because they are , even if they would try to distance themselves from disgust or indignation , not really any different from other people with hobbies , like golf gti collectors or postage stamp collectors or dachshund enthusiasts .
in other words : they have their own way of producing a weblog , washing a gti , peeling off a stamp or feeding a dachshund .
they know what they 're doing , and everyone else is just an amateur .
but do n't let anyone know where you got that from !
the consequences are bad enough .
not only because a holy war has practically developed in the german-speaking world over whether to they should be called " weblogs " or whether they should be called " blogs " -lrb- but here 's an insider tip : it 's called a " weblog " ! -rrb- , or whether a weblog must have a certain number of links in order to differentiate itself from a web diary -lrb- insider tip : i have no idea ! -rrb- or whether a web diary can even be called a weblog !
-lrb- insider tip : no !
of course !
never !
but surely !
absolutely never ! & % $ $ # @ $ * * & % $ & $ @ ! -rrb- .
in addition , there 's also the technical discussion about whether a weblog should be produced using blogging software , in the homelike surroundings of a blogger community , or whether it would be better to have individually installed and customized technology that runs , if possible , off a person 's own server .
unwritten weblog rules and finally , there are unwritten rules for bloggers that require a little self-confidence to break .
to a certain extent , every weblog has to feature pictures of cats every week and they have to link at least once a week to an article that either proves or refutes the idea that weblogs are the form of " grassroots journalism . "
they have to be redesigned at least twice a year , and at least once a year they need to be closed again due to apathy .
but fortunately that 's all a bit exaggerated - even if only a little bit .
for weblogs are nothing more than regularly updated , very subjective , often demonically funny , sometimes even literary and not too seldom political web sites that are made , cultivated and written by individualists who have something to say and , for the most part , can express themselves well .
weblogs are not news sources .
instead they offer commentary about the world and the personal state of the author .
and in this sense , it 's also true that they are hyperventilating , hyper-babble of the hyper - the simplest , fastest and cheapest possibility to reach an audience of millions .
theoretically ... ... because the success of a weblog is quite dependent on the abilities of the writer .
if you want to try yourself , but do n't know anything about the technology at work backstage in your web browser , then you can also attempt it by opening up an account at services like blogger.com , typepad.com or salon.com.

do n't even ask großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bloggers from around the world participate in the bobs awards starting on sept .
17 , you may be asking yourself : " what the heck is a weblog ? "
konstantin klein gives his answer here . here 's a tip : just do n't ask anyone what a blog actually is .
the chances are good that you wo n't get any smarter from the answer .
because you 'll likely either ask someone who has never heard the term before and frankly admits that , or you 'll ask someone who has his or her own blog .
that 's even worse .
but let 's just get to the facts .
" blog " is a term that first began to appear on english web sites in the late nineties .
it melts together the words " web " as in internet and " log " as in book .
in other words , it 's a logbook of a person journeying through the world wide web .
bloggers log interesting observations from their journeys in the log and because the same log is available on the net , anyone can read it .
in order to give the reader something to observe , too , links referring to the subject of the log should also be included - mostly to other web sites , and the link is no problem .
in order to make a web log a weblog , the entries also have to be updated - just like a logbook .
see , that was n't so hard !
the real problem starts with the web loggers .
because they are , even if they would try to distance themselves from disgust or indignation , not really any different from other people with hobbies , like golf gti collectors or postage stamp collectors or dachshund enthusiasts .
in other words : they have their own way of producing a weblog , washing a gti , peeling off a stamp or feeding a dachshund .
they know what they 're doing , and everyone else is just an amateur .
but do n't let anyone know where you got that from !
the consequences are bad enough .
not only because a holy war has practically developed in the german-speaking world over whether to they should be called " weblogs " or whether they should be called " blogs " -lrb- but here 's an insider tip : it 's called a " weblog " ! -rrb- , or whether a weblog must have a certain number of links in order to differentiate itself from a web diary -lrb- insider tip : i have no idea ! -rrb- or whether a web diary can even be called a weblog !
-lrb- insider tip : no !
of course !
never !
but surely !
absolutely never ! & % $ $ # @ $ * * & % $ & $ @ ! -rrb- .
in addition , there 's also the technical discussion about whether a weblog should be produced using blogging software , in the homelike surroundings of a blogger community , or whether it would be better to have individually installed and customized technology that runs , if possible , off a person 's own server .
unwritten weblog rules and finally , there are unwritten rules for bloggers that require a little self-confidence to break .
to a certain extent , every weblog has to feature pictures of cats every week and they have to link at least once a week to an article that either proves or refutes the idea that weblogs are the form of " grassroots journalism . "
they have to be redesigned at least twice a year , and at least once a year they need to be closed again due to apathy .
but fortunately that 's all a bit exaggerated - even if only a little bit .
for weblogs are nothing more than regularly updated , very subjective , often demonically funny , sometimes even literary and not too seldom political web sites that are made , cultivated and written by individualists who have something to say and , for the most part , can express themselves well .
weblogs are not news sources .
instead they offer commentary about the world and the personal state of the author .
and in this sense , it 's also true that they are hyperventilating , hyper-babble of the hyper - the simplest , fastest and cheapest possibility to reach an audience of millions .

do n't even ask großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bloggers from around the world participate in the bobs awards starting on sept .
17 , you may be asking yourself : " what the heck is a weblog ? "
konstantin klein gives his answer here . here 's a tip : just do n't ask anyone what a blog actually is .
the chances are good that you wo n't get any smarter from the answer .
because you 'll likely either ask someone who has never heard the term before and frankly admits that , or you 'll ask someone who has his or her own blog .
that 's even worse .
but let 's just get to the facts .
" blog " is a term that first began to appear on english web sites in the late nineties .
it melts together the words " web " as in internet and " log " as in book .
in other words , it 's a logbook of a person journeying through the world wide web .
bloggers log interesting observations from their journeys in the log and because the same log is available on the net , anyone can read it .
in order to give the reader something to observe , too , links referring to the subject of the log should also be included - mostly to other web sites , and the link is no problem .
in order to make a web log a weblog , the entries also have to be updated - just like a logbook .
see , that was n't so hard !
the real problem starts with the web loggers .
because they are , even if they would try to distance themselves from disgust or indignation , not really any different from other people with hobbies , like golf gti collectors or postage stamp collectors or dachshund enthusiasts .
in other words : they have their own way of producing a weblog , washing a gti , peeling off a stamp or feeding a dachshund .
they know what they 're doing , and everyone else is just an amateur .
but do n't let anyone know where you got that from !
the consequences are bad enough .
not only because a holy war has practically developed in the german-speaking world over whether to they should be called " weblogs " or whether they should be called " blogs " -lrb- but here 's an insider tip : it 's called a " weblog " ! -rrb- , or whether a weblog must have a certain number of links in order to differentiate itself from a web diary -lrb- insider tip : i have no idea ! -rrb- or whether a web diary can even be called a weblog !
-lrb- insider tip : no !
of course !
never !
but surely !
absolutely never ! & % $ $ # @ $ * * & % $ & $ @ ! -rrb- .
in addition , there 's also the technical discussion about whether a weblog should be produced using blogging software , in the homelike surroundings of a blogger community , or whether it would be better to have individually installed and customized technology that runs , if possible , off a person 's own server .
unwritten weblog rules and finally , there are unwritten rules for bloggers that require a little self-confidence to break .
to a certain extent , every weblog has to feature pictures of cats every week and they have to link at least once a week to an article that either proves or refutes the idea that weblogs are the form of " grassroots journalism . "
they have to be redesigned at least twice a year , and at least once a year they need to be closed again due to apathy .
but fortunately that 's all a bit exaggerated - even if only a little bit .
for weblogs are nothing more than regularly updated , very subjective , often demonically funny , sometimes even literary and not too seldom political web sites that are made , cultivated and written by individualists who have something to say and , for the most part , can express themselves well .
weblogs are not news sources .
instead they offer commentary about the world and the personal state of the author .
and in this sense , it 's also true that they are hyperventilating , hyper-babble of the hyper - the simplest , fastest and cheapest possibility to reach an audience of millions .
theoretically ... ... because the success of a weblog is quite dependent on the abilities of the writer .

do n't even ask großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as bloggers from around the world participate in the bobs awards starting on sept .
17 , you may be asking yourself : " what the heck is a weblog ? "
konstantin klein gives his answer here . here 's a tip : just do n't ask anyone what a blog actually is .
the chances are good that you wo n't get any smarter from the answer .
because you 'll likely either ask someone who has never heard the term before and frankly admits that , or you 'll ask someone who has his or her own blog .
that 's even worse .
but let 's just get to the facts .
" blog " is a term that first began to appear on english web sites in the late nineties .
it melts together the words " web " as in internet and " log " as in book .
in other words , it 's a logbook of a person journeying through the world wide web .
bloggers log interesting observations from their journeys in the log and because the same log is available on the net , anyone can read it .
in order to give the reader something to observe , too , links referring to the subject of the log should also be included - mostly to other web sites , and the link is no problem .
in order to make a web log a weblog , the entries also have to be updated - just like a logbook .
see , that was n't so hard !
the real problem starts with the web loggers .
because they are , even if they would try to distance themselves from disgust or indignation , not really any different from other people with hobbies , like golf gti collectors or postage stamp collectors or dachshund enthusiasts .
in other words : they have their own way of producing a weblog , washing a gti , peeling off a stamp or feeding a dachshund .
they know what they 're doing , and everyone else is just an amateur .
but do n't let anyone know where you got that from !
the consequences are bad enough .
not only because a holy war has practically developed in the german-speaking world over whether to they should be called " weblogs " or whether they should be called " blogs " -lrb- but here 's an insider tip : it 's called a " weblog " ! -rrb- , or whether a weblog must have a certain number of links in order to differentiate itself from a web diary -lrb- insider tip : i have no idea ! -rrb- or whether a web diary can even be called a weblog !
-lrb- insider tip : no !
of course !
never !
but surely !
absolutely never ! & % $ $ # @ $ * * & % $ & $ @ ! -rrb- .
in addition , there 's also the technical discussion about whether a weblog should be produced using blogging software , in the homelike surroundings of a blogger community , or whether it would be better to have individually installed and customized technology that runs , if possible , off a person 's own server .
unwritten weblog rules and finally , there are unwritten rules for bloggers that require a little self-confidence to break .
to a certain extent , every weblog has to feature pictures of cats every week and they have to link at least once a week to an article that either proves or refutes the idea that weblogs are the form of " grassroots journalism . "
they have to be redesigned at least twice a year , and at least once a year they need to be closed again due to apathy .
but fortunately that 's all a bit exaggerated - even if only a little bit .
for weblogs are nothing more than regularly updated , very subjective , often demonically funny , sometimes even literary and not too seldom political web sites that are made , cultivated and written by individualists who have something to say and , for the most part , can express themselves well .
weblogs are not news sources .
instead they offer commentary about the world and the personal state of the author .
and in this sense , it 's also true that they are hyperventilating , hyper-babble of the hyper - the simplest , fastest and cheapest possibility to reach an audience of millions .
theoretically ... ... because the success of a weblog is quite dependent on the abilities of the writer .
if you want to try yourself , but do n't know anything about the technology at work backstage in your web browser , then you can also attempt it by opening up an account at services like blogger.com , typepad.com or salon.com.
if you 've already heard of html and do n't mistake ftp for a german political party , then you can also set up an account with a webhoster , install a program like moveabletype.org , pmachine.com -lrb- both available free in their simplest versions -rrb- , nucleuscms.org , wordpress.org or textpattern.com and just start typing .

meanwhile , eu foreign ministers signaled their willingness to take a harder line . on monday , the same day members of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- were gathered in vienna for a meeting , iran announced its plans to resume enriching uranium , thereby effectively going back on a promise made to european leaders last october .
hossein mousavian , head of iran 's delegation to the iaea , told reporters that the suspension of uranium enrichment was a voluntary gesture made by his country " just for a short , temporary period . "
european foreign ministers gathered in brussels to discuss how to handle the stubborn would-be atomic power did not react favorably to the news .
in a reversal of previous policy , they indicated that the time may have come to abandon constructive engagement in favor of a harder line .
" there is a risk of tehran making a miscalculation , " german foreign minster joschka fischer said in brussels .
" i hope that it sees and understands that .
if not , we could be in a serious situation . "
his british counterpart , foreign secretary jack straw , added : " they can not turn the issue of confidence on and off like a tap . "
playing the same game ?
" it 's always the same " , a british diplomat recently complained .
" whenever more pressure is applied to tehran , the government concedes to a compromise at the last minute .
but what does this actually gain ?
a little more time for negotiation , but hardly a solution to end the conflict once and for all , " he added the same pattern seemed to be developing in the run-up to monday 's meeting of iaea .
the united states , frustrated with iran 's tug-of-war , signaled that time was running out for iran to cooperate with the international community .
meanwhile , europe antagonized the us by lobbying for more negotiations and rejecting proposals to pass the matter along to the un security council .
this time around , however , things may be very different indeed .
according to sources in brussels , eu foreign ministers are prepared to pursue a tougher course of action .
eu diplomats signaled that the bloc may agree to send the matter to the security council after all .
referral to the un could lead to punitive actions for tehran if it does not comply with security council resolutions .
eu 's tougher line britain , france and germany indicated that they were close to an agreement with the us to settle a november deadline for iran to come clean about its atomic weapons plans , according to the newswire afp .
europe 's " big three " have previously resisted setting a time limit .
over the course of nearly a year , officials from london , paris and berlin , held off washington , while us politicians argued that iran was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction .
but since signing an agreement with the three eu countries last october , tehran has backtracked on some of its promises , such as suspending manufacturing of centrifuges used for uranium enrichment .
in the last several months , iran has also proven less open to europe 's diplomacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohamed el baradei , secretary general iaea a european draft resolution , proposed by britain , france and germany , could call on iaea secretary general mohamed el baradei -lrb- photo -rrb- to file a report before the next board meeting in november and make a " definite determination on whether or not further steps are required , " a diplomat close to iaea told afp .
rather than threatening with an ultimatum and sanctions as the us has suggested , such a time frame would once again give iran the chance to modify its nuclear policies over the next two months and avoid a full confrontation with the united states .
but should iran pass up this last chance , they may not find a willing advocate for further negotiations in the europe - that is if eu foreign ministers back-up monday 's tough talk with tough actions . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran said to be close to nuclear deal ahead of a meeting of the un 's nuclear watchdog next week , diplomats said iran has agreed in principle to freeze some of its nuclear activities .

but some believe that a harmonization of tax bases is the first step towards harmonizing the rates that companies are charged throughout the eu - a system opposed by both the commission and the uk but supported by france and germany .
german finance minister hans eichel welcomed the move as a step towards corporate tax harmonization .
" the first step is harmonizing the tax base and then we can talk sensibly over a minimum rate , " he said according to reuters .
british finance minister gordon brown however , said that he " would not support any move towards tax harmonisation , " adding : " there is no need for it and it is certainly not a priority .
economic reform is a priority . "
any changes to eu tax law have to be agreed unanimously .

the paper wrote that new ideas such as education or child care , medical services or care for the elderly are needed in the sparsely populated regions in eastern germany .
looking towards spain or scandinavia could help , according to the daily : there people had similar problems to solve , it concluded .
the südkurier in constance pointed out that the german president had only expressed what had long been a reality .
the billions of euros worth of subsidies poured into east for its development would n't bridge the prosperity gap between the west and east of the country .
cities such as cottbus and rostock still have record unemployment rates .
there was no trace of an upswing .
so there was no question that it was legitimate to call for a reform of the subsidies for the east , the paper wrote and praised the president for his courage in making that point .
but it added that his timing was off .
his controversial and untimely comments came before two local elections and the paper feared that this debate would only strengthen the radical parties .

the need for change in germany had demanded this from the highest office holder of the country .
köhler has now proven this , opined the paper .
but it was surprised over the angry reaction over köhler ’ s comments from the political camps .
it appeared as if the former east had waited for such a signal in order to raise a warning finger to point to the fact that the country was not unified , according to the paper .
such messages are not new and this was evidenced in the weekly demonstrations , wrote the daily , admonishing germans to overcome the split in society .
this was the central message of köhler ’ s inaugural speech .
the president has shown the need for honesty , the paper concluded .
the stuttgarter nachrichten wrote that the president would have to explain himself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 eu calls for un probe of sudan genocide charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : displaced sudanese women carry firewood to a refugee camp on monday , the european union 's foreign ministers urged the united nations to conduct an inquiry into allegations of genocide in sudan , renewing the threat of sanctions for the african country . the eu foreign ministers , meeting in brussels , also threatened to impose sanctions against the sudanese government if it did n't take action to disarm militias in the darfur region , where over a million people have been displaced and thousands killed by fighting .
at the same time , the eu welcomed humanitarian progress in the region , which has seen the successful delivery of food to refugees .
however , security remains a " major challenge , " the ministers said .
with the un estimating that more than 50,000 sudanese have been killed and another 1.2 million forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers expressed their concern over a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word " genocide " was not uttered in public comments made by any of the ministers .
they know labelling the situation will determine their course of action - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps required by un obligations to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
" a desperate situation " when asked by reporters about us secretary of state colin powell 's description of the situation as " genocide , " british foreign secretary jack straw said some had called it " genocide , ethnic cleansing or civil war " .
but regardless of the label , he said , " it 's a desperate situation which requires the urgent attention of the world . "
as it calls for the un to investigate the genocide claims , the eu is also exerting pressure on sudan to rein in its militias and threatening sanctions if it does n't .
" the government of sudan needs to understand that the prospect -lrb- of sanctions -rrb- will come much closer and turn into a reality unless we see much better cooperation on the crucial issues of law and order and safety in darfur , " british foreign secretary jack straw said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , and the sudanese foriegn minister mostafa osman ismail in khartoum on july 12 , 2004 .
germany 's joschka fischer also pressed for sudan to do more .
" above all , the pressure should not let-up now , " he told reporters .
" there has been progress , but it has not been fully implemented in particular parts . "
earlier , fischer said pressure from the international community had prevented a greater tragedy than the current " humanitarian catastrophe with genocidal potential . "
the pressure was first exerted in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can do at the moment because of hesitance from italy , spain and greece .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
" i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .
" they know how to read the contradictory signs that were given by the international community in dealing politically with this issue . " dw staff -lrb- dsl / sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unanimity slows eu response in sudan lack of agreement keeps the eu from flexing its foreign policy muscles .
that is especially apparent in darfur 's humanitarian catastrophe , which has ministers " extremely concerned " but unable to enforce any action .

that is especially apparent in darfur 's humanitarian catastrophe , which has ministers " extremely concerned " but unable to enforce any action . while the un estimates that more than 50,000 people have been killed with another 1.2 million sudanese forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers have expressed their concern about a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word genocide has not been uttered by any of the eu 's foreign ministers , who will discuss the darfur situation at their monthly meeting monday .
they know how they label the situation will determine their next actions - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps demanded by their un obligation to stop genocide wherever it occurs .

" if the international community had not reacted so strongly , the humanitarian situation , which had potential to lead to genocide , would be much worse than today 's deplorable reality . "
the pressure was first put on in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can achieve because hesitance in italy , spain and greece keeps the eu from being able to demand stronger action .

that is especially apparent in darfur 's humanitarian catastrophe , which has ministers " extremely concerned " but unable to enforce any action . while the un estimates that more than 50,000 people have been killed with another 1.2 million sudanese forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers have expressed their concern about a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word genocide has not been uttered by any of the eu 's foreign ministers , who will discuss the darfur situation at their monthly meeting monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc spelling of ' euro ' creates unexpected headache european central bank president jean-claude trichet informed ministers that the word ' euro ' was being spelled differently across europe .
in slovenia , for example , it is called ' evro ' .
latvians - if and when they join the common currency - will pay with ' eiro ' and in hungary , the word has an accent .
this contravenes a regulation drawn up by eu leaders in 1997 that the word must be spelled ' euro ' in all official languages .
greece , however , is exempt because it has a different alphabet .
dutch finance minister gerrit zalm said , " we were surprised to find that this problem existed , but we solved it , " joking , " you see how decisive finance ministers can sometimes be . "
however , he was flummoxed by a question asking what form the plural should take .
some use ' euro ' , others ' euros . '
the problem is unlikely to arise in the new member states for a few years .
although all ten new entrants to the eu club are treaty-bound to join the single currency , none is likely to do so before 2007 .

that is especially apparent in darfur 's humanitarian catastrophe , which has ministers " extremely concerned " but unable to enforce any action . while the un estimates that more than 50,000 people have been killed with another 1.2 million sudanese forced from their homes since february 2003 , the eu foreign ministers have expressed their concern about a situation others believe to be genocide .
but the word genocide has not been uttered by any of the eu 's foreign ministers , who will discuss the darfur situation at their monthly meeting monday .
they know how they label the situation will determine their next actions - and not all the bloc 's governments are ready to take the steps demanded by their un obligation to stop genocide wherever it occurs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister fischer , left , met with sudanese state minister nagieb al-khier , in july " we need to keep up the pressure , " german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" if the international community had not reacted so strongly , the humanitarian situation , which had potential to lead to genocide , would be much worse than today 's deplorable reality . "
the pressure was first put on in july when eu ministers agreed with a un resolution demanding the sudanese government disarm the pro-government janjaweed militia , try militia members for their crimes and protect the darfur population .
some eu states call for stronger action while germany , france and the britain would like to join in the united states ' call for un sanctions against khartoum , political pressure is the best they can achieve because hesitance in italy , spain and greece keeps the eu from being able to demand stronger action .
they would rather see the union reinforce its opposition to the situation , a move that others think would play into the sudanese government 's hands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 1.2 million sudanese have been driven from their homes " i have the feeling that the government of sudan is at the moment laughing at us , at the international community , " said ana gomes , a portuguese member of the european parliament who recently returned from a fact-finding trip to darfur .
" they know how to read the contradictory signs that were given by the international community in dealing politically with this issue . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 spain gets back to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero : re-orienting spanish policy toward the world spanish prime minister zapatero is meeting with his german and french counterparts in madrid on monday , a further step in fine-tuning spain 's relationship to europe . spain is in the news again .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .
" the spanish government says : ' if we behave like proper europeans , we have better chances of getting support for structural funds . " re-orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers from the plus ultra ii brigade who were based in iraq , disembark with a spanish flag with a bull printed on it on arrival at a spanish military base in talavera la real , western spain on april 20 , 2004 after they were relieved by another contingent of troops .
donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .
" it 's disappeared into a no man 's land - from the viewpoint of the franco-german axis . spain may be less visible now , but that 's only because it 's less vocal , not less important , manuel ecuvero , a macro-economic and international political analyst at instituto de empresa , spain 's leading business school , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission headquarters in brussels but spain has no leverage to prevent an end to its brussels cash flow , ecuvero said .
spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .
berlin , in particular , one of the countries that pays the highest per capita contribution to the eu , has made clear that that amount should decrease . " more and more there is the certainty that the structural funds will run out and we will have to stand on our own , " ecuvero conceded . no longer upside-down madrid has indeed changed its policies toward the eu under zapatero , including cultivating relations to france and germany .

socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne .

donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .

spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .

socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .
" the spanish government says : ' if we behave like proper europeans , we have better chances of getting support for structural funds .

donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .
" it 's disappeared into a no man 's land - from the viewpoint of the franco-german axis . spain may be less visible now , but that 's only because it 's less vocal , not less important , manuel ecuvero , a macro-economic and international political analyst at instituto de empresa , spain 's leading business school , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission headquarters in brussels but spain has no leverage to prevent an end to its brussels cash flow , ecuvero said .
spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .
berlin , in particular , one of the countries that pays the highest per capita contribution to the eu , has made clear that that amount should decrease . " more and more there is the certainty that the structural funds will run out and we will have to stand on our own , " ecuvero conceded . no longer upside-down madrid has indeed changed its policies toward the eu under zapatero , including cultivating relations to france and germany .
but according to ecuvero , the aim was n't to create an overt alliance . " aznar turned traditional spanish international relations upside-down , " he said .
" we are refocusing our policy toward europe , toward latin america , toward the world .

providing subsidies to bridge those differences , particularly in the six eastern states , would burden the younger generation with very high debts . " there were and are everywhere in the republic large differences in living standards , " köhler was quoted as saying .
" if you want to level them out , you cement the subsidized state and place an intolerable burden of debt on the young generation .
we must get away from the subsidized state . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an apartment complex in the marzahn neighborhood in eastern berlin nearly 15 years after the berlin wall fell , unemployment in the eastern states is more than twice the level in the western part of the country .
under a so-called " solidarity pact " that expires in 2020 , billions of euros are being transferred east in a bid to equalize living standards . a special government-appointed commission recently concluded on the state of the eastern german economy and how difficult it will be to bring it up to western german levels .
the report said the massive injection of more than € 1.25 trillion -lrb- $ 1.5 trillion -rrb- , into the eastern states since 1990 has not created jobs or helped to create a new manufacturing base . remarks fuel growing debate köhler 's comments come at a time when protests against a government drive to trim social programs , in particular a new law that will cut benefits for the long-term jobless , are stoking seething resentment in the eastern states .
the interview also comes just days after a report that suggested every fourth western german and every eighth eastern german wanted a return of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an election poster for the rightextremist national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- against the government 's social welfare reforms his remarks , made a week before voters in the eastern german states of brandenburg and saxony go to the polls to elect state governments are likely to be exploited by the far-right parties as well as the party of democratic socialists -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the east german communist party .
the reform proposals have been seized on by opposition parties , eager to fight the debate on an apparent east-west divide . the ruling social democrats have already experienced the backlash of public opinion , tasting resounding defeat in the regional elections in the western state of saarland , as citizens of the eastern regions fight back against the welfare reforms which will affect them the most . schröder calls on one country , one people in response to köhler 's remarks , chancellor gerhard schröder told inforadio berlin-brandenburg : " we are one country , one people and we must do politics for all of germany . " christoph matschie , the spd leader in the eastern german state of thuringia , told the international herald tribune that köhler had " instigated a highly dangerous debate , " adding it would strengthen feelings in the western states that the east germans have had enough financial support . reactions suggest concern wolfgang böhmer , the premier of the eastern german state of saxony-anhalt , said the constitution itself stipulates the goal of bringing poorer states up to the average standard of the more well-off ones , implying köhler was questioning those principles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and brandenburg 's premier matthias platzeck at a party conference in august .
matthias platzeck -lrb- photo , right -rrb- , the social democratic prime minister of brandenburg who still hopes to continue sharing power with the conservative christian democrats after elections next sunday , said it was " obvious to me there are differences among the regions .
the question is how wide they are . " iris gleicke , a deputy minister for eastern german reconstruction , described the president 's argument in the sächsische zeitung daily as " absurd " while lothar bisky , the leader of the ex-communist pds told the bild am sonntag newspaper : " whether deliberately or not , köhler is questioning special support for the east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.09.2004 spain gets back to business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zapatero : re-orienting spanish policy toward the world spanish prime minister zapatero is meeting with his german and french counterparts in madrid on monday , a further step in fine-tuning spain 's relationship to europe . spain is in the news again .
socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero held up his country pulling troops out of iraq as an example for others on thursday . " i can only say that the decision to withdraw the troops was a very correct decision , " zapatero told journalists during a visit to tunis .
" all respect to all the countries that are there , but if there were more decisions along the lines of the spanish government 's more favorable prospects would be opened up . " since zapatero kept the campaign pledge to bring spanish troops home from iraq that helped him to a surprise win in april parliamentary elections , europe 's press has n't wasted many words on his country .
but spain has started re-orienting its foreign policies , and it aims to wield more influence , especially in the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder -lrb- left -rrb- and french president chirac french prime minister jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder , the current torch-bearers of the so-called " franco-german axis " which many credit with determining eu policies , will be zapatero 's interlocutors on monday .
the agenda has n't been set , but it 's no secret what the spanish leader wants to talk about : money . money at stake spain is a top beneficiary of eu structural funds - aid to help less developed eu countries catch up - which make up 1 percent of its gnp .
it also receives more eu cohesion funds - intended to improve the environment and develop transport infrastructure in member states whose per capita gnp is below 90 percent of the bloc average - than any other country . eu enlargement in may added 10 new - and largely poorer - countries to the union , simultaneously increasing spain 's per capita gnp to around 95 percent .
thus , according to the current criteria , spain has no hope of pocketing any of the aid after this round of funds dry up at the end of 2006 . that explains , in part , zapatero courting chirac and schröder , according to jürgen donges , a specialist on spanish politics and economics at the university of cologne . " when you 're in spain you hear over and over : ' we want to play a part in this franco-german axis , " ' donges told dw-world .
" the spanish government says : ' if we behave like proper europeans , we have better chances of getting support for structural funds . " re-orientation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish soldiers from the plus ultra ii brigade who were based in iraq , disembark with a spanish flag with a bull printed on it on arrival at a spanish military base in talavera la real , western spain on april 20 , 2004 after they were relieved by another contingent of troops .
donges pointed to the change in approach since zapatero took over the reins of power from his conservative partido popular leader jose maria aznar . " the current government makes domestic policies according to the device : ' everything that aznar did was bad ; we have to do everything differently , " ' he said . aznar cultivated spanish ties to the united states and , ignoring popular opposition , sent 1,300 troops to iraq to help us-led coalition forces there .
in doing so , he rubbed wrong his german and french counterparts , who were vehemently opposed to the iraq war . " but since the new orientation spain has become less important to germany , " donges said .
" it 's disappeared into a no man 's land - from the viewpoint of the franco-german axis . spain may be less visible now , but that 's only because it 's less vocal , not less important , manuel ecuvero , a macro-economic and international political analyst at instituto de empresa , spain 's leading business school , told dw-world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission headquarters in brussels but spain has no leverage to prevent an end to its brussels cash flow , ecuvero said .
spain may wish structural funds would n't run out for it , but zapatero ca n't realistically expect to stop the practically inevitable when he meets with schröder and chirac .
berlin , in particular , one of the countries that pays the highest per capita contribution to the eu , has made clear that that amount should decrease . " more and more there is the certainty that the structural funds will run out and we will have to stand on our own , " ecuvero conceded . no longer upside-down madrid has indeed changed its policies toward the eu under zapatero , including cultivating relations to france and germany .
but according to ecuvero , the aim was n't to create an overt alliance . " aznar turned traditional spanish international relations upside-down , " he said .
" we are refocusing our policy toward europe , toward latin america , toward the world .
zapatero is recovering the lines that spanish foreign policy has pursued for 50 years .

the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- said heart disease and strokes could be reduced by cutting down on salt .
the recommended daily limit for adults is six grams , but research shows many people eat more than double that .
fsa scotland 's jim thomson said people should think before adding salt to their food and said " hiding the salt cellar " was one possible solution .
high salt intake is linked to the " silent killer " of high blood pressure , which affects about a third of the population in scotland .
salt advice do not add salt at the table - use flavourings like herbs and spices if you have time , bake your own bread make your own stock instead of using stock cubes when buying tinned vegetables , go for brands with no added salt avoid crisps and salted peanuts go easy on bacon , sausages and takeaway foods check food labels - anything with less than 0.2 grams of sodium per hundred grams is fine food containing more than half a gram of sodium per hundred grams should be avoided the campaign aims to persuade people to be more health conscious when preparing food .
mr thomson said : " when you 're at home , you add salt .
instead , hide the salt cellar .
" if you 're out for a meal , do n't take salt .
" when you 're actually buying products , either to cook or make meals , read the labels because there is information on them on salt intake .
" by that , you as an individual then take control of your salt intake . "
salt raises blood pressure and increases the risk of heart attack or stroke .
it has also been linked to stomach cancer , osteoporosis and kidney problems .
the government recommends salt consumption of no more than six grams per day -lrb- three grams or less for children -rrb- , but most adults consume about 12g .

the food standards agency -lrb- fsa -rrb- said heart disease and strokes could be reduced by cutting down on salt .
the recommended daily limit for adults is six grams , but research shows many people eat more than double that .
fsa scotland 's jim thomson said people should think before adding salt to their food and said " hiding the salt cellar " was one possible solution .
high salt intake is linked to the " silent killer " of high blood pressure , which affects about a third of the population in scotland .
salt advice do not add salt at the table - use flavourings like herbs and spices if you have time , bake your own bread make your own stock instead of using stock cubes when buying tinned vegetables , go for brands with no added salt avoid crisps and salted peanuts go easy on bacon , sausages and takeaway foods check food labels - anything with less than 0.2 grams of sodium per hundred grams is fine food containing more than half a gram of sodium per hundred grams should be avoided the campaign aims to persuade people to be more health conscious when preparing food .
mr thomson said : " when you 're at home , you add salt .
instead , hide the salt cellar .
" if you 're out for a meal , do n't take salt .
" when you 're actually buying products , either to cook or make meals , read the labels because there is information on them on salt intake .
" by that , you as an individual then take control of your salt intake . "
salt raises blood pressure and increases the risk of heart attack or stroke .
it has also been linked to stomach cancer , osteoporosis and kidney problems .
the government recommends salt consumption of no more than six grams per day -lrb- three grams or less for children -rrb- , but most adults consume about 12g .
