" my performances are more consistent , " said lehmann , after kahn had made some unforced errors in a friendly match against croatia .
" over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " arsenal club officials are now likely to see that otherwise .

the only major acquisition by the top european team over the summer , from german club borussia dortmund , lehmann had a solid season in goal for the high-flying club which is on track to finish first in england 's premier league . only his temper , a problem in the bundesliga in the past , drew lehmann negative press .
he was recently fined 10,000 pounds -lrb- € 15,151 -rrb- after throwing a ball at another player following a dust-up in front of the goal .

weeks after he told an interviewer that he , not oliver kahn , should be the germany 's top goalkeeper , jens lehmann got benched by his london club arsenal for mistakes that led to the team 's champion 's league exit . two mistakes by jens lehmann in two crucial games against rival london club chelsea in the past two weeks , was apparently one too many for arsenal management , who are reportedly looking for a new keeper . lehmann , who observers say has otherwise played solidly in goal for arsenal this season , came out too early to challenge a chelsea striker , yielding 0-1 in the first game of the quarterfinal matchup .

in the second game last tuesday , lehmann deflected a shot back in front of the goal , easy pickings for chelsea 's frank lampard to tie the game .

" my performances are more consistent , " said lehmann , after kahn had made some unforced errors in a friendly match against croatia .
" over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " arsenal club officials are now likely to see that otherwise .

this year the main issues of protest are the social effects of german government reforms , plans to expand the german military 's activities abroad as well as calls for condemning the iraq war .
but participation has so far been low , especially compared to last year 's turnout , when ten thousands of protesters voiced their opposition to the iraq war .
around 350 demonstrators took part in the march in chemnitz , organizers said , the biggest so far .
events , including demonstrations on bicycle and religious services calling for peace , are planned in more than 60 german cities over the easter holiday .
the largest activities are expected sunday .
peace marches have been held in germany since 1960 , two years after they were first kicked off in london by british philosopher bertrand russell . more briefs 09.04.2004 -pipe- government denies cabinet reshuffle plans 08.04.2004 -pipe- german sept .

lehmann still has a place in coach rudi völler 's national team .
weeks after he told an interviewer that he , not oliver kahn , should be the germany 's top goalkeeper , jens lehmann got benched by his london club arsenal for mistakes that led to the team 's champion 's league exit . two mistakes by jens lehmann in two crucial games against rival london club chelsea in the past two weeks , was apparently one too many for arsenal management , who are reportedly looking for a new keeper . lehmann , who observers say has otherwise played solidly in goal for arsenal this season , came out too early to challenge a chelsea striker , yielding 0-1 in the first game of the quarterfinal matchup .
in the second game last tuesday , lehmann deflected a shot back in front of the goal , easy pickings for chelsea 's frank lampard to tie the game .
chelsea went on to win 2-1 , sending arsenal packing out of the tournament of europe 's top soccer clubs . on friday , the british tabloid the sun reported that arsenal coach arsene wenger was trying to sign another goalkeeper and bench lehmann , 34 .
" wenger promptly decided that was the last straw for his accident-prone german , " according to the sun . no mistake the reports came more than a month after lehmann told an interviewer for germany 's kicker magazine that he was a better goalkeeper than kahn , sparking a national debate and earning criticism from fans and players alike . " my performances are more consistent , " said lehmann , after kahn had made some unforced errors in a friendly match against croatia .
" over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " arsenal club officials are now likely to see that otherwise .
until his recent mistakes , lehmann was in good standing .
the only major acquisition by the top european team over the summer , from german club borussia dortmund , lehmann had a solid season in goal for the high-flying club which is on track to finish first in england 's premier league . only his temper , a problem in the bundesliga in the past , drew lehmann negative press .
he was recently fined 10,000 pounds -lrb- € 15,151 -rrb- after throwing a ball at another player following a dust-up in front of the goal .
but his meticulous game preparation and billowing self-confidence have earned him respect in the premier league . up until the recent games , that is . beethoven , schiffer ...
lehmann ? " the germans gave the world beethoven , claudia schiffer and michael schumacher , " wrote the sun recently .
" arsenal , sadly , got jens lehmann . " his problems on the island are not likely to affect his standing on the national team .
head coach rudi völler recently gave lehmann his first start in goal , during a friendly against belgium .

" my performances are more consistent , " said lehmann , after kahn had made some unforced errors in a friendly match against croatia .
" over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " arsenal club officials are now likely to see that otherwise .

the only major acquisition by the top european team over the summer , from german club borussia dortmund , lehmann had a solid season in goal for the high-flying club which is on track to finish first in england 's premier league . only his temper , a problem in the bundesliga in the past , drew lehmann negative press .
he was recently fined 10,000 pounds -lrb- € 15,151 -rrb- after throwing a ball at another player following a dust-up in front of the goal .

this year the main issues of protest are the social effects of german government reforms , plans to expand the german military 's activities abroad as well as calls for condemning the iraq war .
but participation has so far been low , especially compared to last year 's turnout , when ten thousands of protesters voiced their opposition to the iraq war .
around 350 demonstrators took part in the march in chemnitz , organizers said , the biggest so far .
events , including demonstrations on bicycle and religious services calling for peace , are planned in more than 60 german cities over the easter holiday .
the largest activities are expected sunday .
peace marches have been held in germany since 1960 , two years after they were first kicked off in london by british philosopher bertrand russell . more briefs 09.04.2004 -pipe- government denies cabinet reshuffle plans 08.04.2004 -pipe- german sept .

lehmann still has a place in coach rudi völler 's national team .
weeks after he told an interviewer that he , not oliver kahn , should be the germany 's top goalkeeper , jens lehmann got benched by his london club arsenal for mistakes that led to the team 's champion 's league exit . two mistakes by jens lehmann in two crucial games against rival london club chelsea in the past two weeks , was apparently one too many for arsenal management , who are reportedly looking for a new keeper . lehmann , who observers say has otherwise played solidly in goal for arsenal this season , came out too early to challenge a chelsea striker , yielding 0-1 in the first game of the quarterfinal matchup .
in the second game last tuesday , lehmann deflected a shot back in front of the goal , easy pickings for chelsea 's frank lampard to tie the game .
chelsea went on to win 2-1 , sending arsenal packing out of the tournament of europe 's top soccer clubs . on friday , the british tabloid the sun reported that arsenal coach arsene wenger was trying to sign another goalkeeper and bench lehmann , 34 .
" wenger promptly decided that was the last straw for his accident-prone german , " according to the sun . no mistake the reports came more than a month after lehmann told an interviewer for germany 's kicker magazine that he was a better goalkeeper than kahn , sparking a national debate and earning criticism from fans and players alike . " my performances are more consistent , " said lehmann , after kahn had made some unforced errors in a friendly match against croatia .
" over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " arsenal club officials are now likely to see that otherwise .
until his recent mistakes , lehmann was in good standing .
the only major acquisition by the top european team over the summer , from german club borussia dortmund , lehmann had a solid season in goal for the high-flying club which is on track to finish first in england 's premier league . only his temper , a problem in the bundesliga in the past , drew lehmann negative press .
he was recently fined 10,000 pounds -lrb- € 15,151 -rrb- after throwing a ball at another player following a dust-up in front of the goal .
but his meticulous game preparation and billowing self-confidence have earned him respect in the premier league . up until the recent games , that is . beethoven , schiffer ...

weeks after he told an interviewer that he , not oliver kahn , should be the germany 's top goalkeeper , jens lehmann got benched by his london club arsenal for mistakes that led to the team 's champion 's league exit . two mistakes by jens lehmann in two crucial games against rival london club chelsea in the past two weeks , was apparently one too many for arsenal management , who are reportedly looking for a new keeper . lehmann , who observers say has otherwise played solidly in goal for arsenal this season , came out too early to challenge a chelsea striker , yielding 0-1 in the first game of the quarterfinal matchup .
in the second game last tuesday , lehmann deflected a shot back in front of the goal , easy pickings for chelsea 's frank lampard to tie the game .
chelsea went on to win 2-1 , sending arsenal packing out of the tournament of europe 's top soccer clubs . on friday , the british tabloid the sun reported that arsenal coach arsene wenger was trying to sign another goalkeeper and bench lehmann , 34 .

" my performances are more consistent , " said lehmann , after kahn had made some unforced errors in a friendly match against croatia .
" over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " arsenal club officials are now likely to see that otherwise .
until his recent mistakes , lehmann was in good standing .
the only major acquisition by the top european team over the summer , from german club borussia dortmund , lehmann had a solid season in goal for the high-flying club which is on track to finish first in england 's premier league . only his temper , a problem in the bundesliga in the past , drew lehmann negative press .
he was recently fined 10,000 pounds -lrb- € 15,151 -rrb- after throwing a ball at another player following a dust-up in front of the goal .

lehmann still has a place in coach rudi völler 's national team .
weeks after he told an interviewer that he , not oliver kahn , should be the germany 's top goalkeeper , jens lehmann got benched by his london club arsenal for mistakes that led to the team 's champion 's league exit . two mistakes by jens lehmann in two crucial games against rival london club chelsea in the past two weeks , was apparently one too many for arsenal management , who are reportedly looking for a new keeper . lehmann , who observers say has otherwise played solidly in goal for arsenal this season , came out too early to challenge a chelsea striker , yielding 0-1 in the first game of the quarterfinal matchup .
in the second game last tuesday , lehmann deflected a shot back in front of the goal , easy pickings for chelsea 's frank lampard to tie the game .
chelsea went on to win 2-1 , sending arsenal packing out of the tournament of europe 's top soccer clubs . on friday , the british tabloid the sun reported that arsenal coach arsene wenger was trying to sign another goalkeeper and bench lehmann , 34 .
" wenger promptly decided that was the last straw for his accident-prone german , " according to the sun . no mistake the reports came more than a month after lehmann told an interviewer for germany 's kicker magazine that he was a better goalkeeper than kahn , sparking a national debate and earning criticism from fans and players alike . " my performances are more consistent , " said lehmann , after kahn had made some unforced errors in a friendly match against croatia .
" over the past year i have lost two games and made two mistakes .
i ca n't really say that anybody else is better than i am . " arsenal club officials are now likely to see that otherwise .
until his recent mistakes , lehmann was in good standing .
the only major acquisition by the top european team over the summer , from german club borussia dortmund , lehmann had a solid season in goal for the high-flying club which is on track to finish first in england 's premier league . only his temper , a problem in the bundesliga in the past , drew lehmann negative press .
he was recently fined 10,000 pounds -lrb- € 15,151 -rrb- after throwing a ball at another player following a dust-up in front of the goal .
but his meticulous game preparation and billowing self-confidence have earned him respect in the premier league . up until the recent games , that is . beethoven , schiffer ...
lehmann ? " the germans gave the world beethoven , claudia schiffer and michael schumacher , " wrote the sun recently .
" arsenal , sadly , got jens lehmann . " his problems on the island are not likely to affect his standing on the national team .
head coach rudi völler recently gave lehmann his first start in goal , during a friendly against belgium .
the 34-year-old goalie could also play against romania . the upcoming european championships in portugal in june , however , remain kahn 's turf . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's top two goalkeepers at each other 's throats a war of words between germany 's top two goalkeepers has now dragged in some of soccer 's most important personalities .

but beware - the zombie movie genre has woken up , and it does not look like going away without a fight .
decades after george a romero scared the life out of cinemagoers with the classic zombie horror night of the living dead -lrb- 1968 -rrb- , the movie world has been plagued again with shambling corpses .
and they are shuffling all the way to the bank .
in the us , a remake of cult 70s zombie film dawn of the dead has proved , literally , bigger than jesus .
it has toppled mel gibson 's almighty epic the passion of the christ from the top of the north american box office charts .
and this week simon pegg and edgar wright , the creators of the hit channel 4 comedy spaced , release a " romantic zombie comedy " - or " romzomcom " - shaun of the dead .
film historian dr matthew sweet told bbc news online the history of the zombie film goes back as far as the 1930s , with the undead treated more " poetically " to comment on capitalism .
caribbean zombies were originally raised from the dead by voodoo priests to work for free on greedy landowners fields and plantations .
the golden period of the zombie movie was the late 70s and early 80s , after george romero made the first of his dead sequels with the apocalyptic dawn of the dead .
the shaun of the dead cast ' do ' zombie in the 1979 cult horror , hordes of zombies have risen from the grave and are killing all in their path .
a small group of survivors fleeing in a helicopter find refuge in a suburban shopping mall , but soon find themselves under siege as a rapidly growing army of zombies attempt to get in .
six years later , romero completed his bloodthirsty trilogy with day of the dead , where a band of scientists and soldiers holed up in a nuclear missile base tried to find a way to beat the ever-growing army of the undead .
but as the 1980s turned into the 90s , zombies lost their cachet .
the cult of the vampire rose , and the zombie film retreated to the shadows .
dr sweet says : " they became synonymous with naff and cheap horror .
they are probably the easiest monster to make .
" the shaun of the dead makers showed that - they just got a load of their mates in and made them go " uuuurrrgghhh ! "
they 're just us : motorised instinct simon pegg on the allure of zombies the first flickering signs of reanimation came in 2002 , when british film-maker danny boyle released 28 days later , an apocalyptic thriller-horror about a bicycle courier waking from a coma to find london deserted - apart from the zombified " infected " .
the film was a huge critical and commercial hit in the uk - and in the us , where it made more than $ 45m -lrb- £ 24.8m -rrb- .
shaun of the dead 's co-creator simon pegg told bbc news online there was enduring appeal in the shuffling monsters .
" for me it 's always been the strangeness of zombies , in that they are very slow and almost inept and shambolic - without motive , without moral rage or agenda .
they 're just us : motorised instinct , " he says .
" there 's something really eerie about that .
they do n't mean any harm ; they 're just doing their thing , " he says .
the dead are rising from the grave ... and they 're voting democrat !
and why is it that they have struck a chord again ?
" you could give it to a film student and wait for an essay , but i think it 's probably fear of ourselves - fear of the enemy within , and fear of the fact we are the greatest threat to each other now .
in this city we could all be killed at any moment .
" art always reflects where it comes from , and these are concerns that are with us at the moment .
if you look back at horror films in the 80s , films like the fly , it was all about body horror and fear of viruses .
now it seems to be we are frightened of each other , " he says .
though even pegg has to admit the zombie can make a rubbish monster .
" we could all be in a room with one now and it 'll never get you - it 'll just be stumbling around like a fool . "
but despite their athletic shortcomings , dr sweet says the zombie is an effective villain for a good reason - because " they can be anything you want them to be " .
" they can carry any metaphor you like .
they can stand for man 's environmental meddling , or of our alienation from each other .
they are there to be controlled , " he added .

film historian dr matthew sweet told bbc news online the history of the zombie film goes back as far as the 1930s , with the undead treated more " poetically " to comment on capitalism .
caribbean zombies were originally raised from the dead by voodoo priests to work for free on greedy landowners fields and plantations .

a small group of survivors fleeing in a helicopter find refuge in a suburban shopping mall , but soon find themselves under siege as a rapidly growing army of zombies attempt to get in .
six years later , romero completed his bloodthirsty trilogy with day of the dead , where a band of scientists and soldiers holed up in a nuclear missile base tried to find a way to beat the ever-growing army of the undead .

they 're just us : motorised instinct simon pegg on the allure of zombies the first flickering signs of reanimation came in 2002 , when british film-maker danny boyle released 28 days later , an apocalyptic thriller-horror about a bicycle courier waking from a coma to find london deserted - apart from the zombified " infected " .
the film was a huge critical and commercial hit in the uk - and in the us , where it made more than $ 45m -lrb- £ 24.8m -rrb- .
shaun of the dead 's co-creator simon pegg told bbc news online there was enduring appeal in the shuffling monsters .
" for me it 's always been the strangeness of zombies , in that they are very slow and almost inept and shambolic - without motive , without moral rage or agenda .

" you could give it to a film student and wait for an essay , but i think it 's probably fear of ourselves - fear of the enemy within , and fear of the fact we are the greatest threat to each other now .

if you look back at horror films in the 80s , films like the fly , it was all about body horror and fear of viruses .

" we could all be in a room with one now and it 'll never get you - it 'll just be stumbling around like a fool . "
but despite their athletic shortcomings , dr sweet says the zombie is an effective villain for a good reason - because " they can be anything you want them to be " .
" they can carry any metaphor you like .
they can stand for man 's environmental meddling , or of our alienation from each other .
they are there to be controlled , " he added .
