but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "

germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc german tabloid reprimanded for beheading photos germany 's best-selling newspaper , bild , has been publicly reprimanded by the country 's press council because of the publication of photos showing the murder of the american businessman nicholas berg , who was beheaded on video by iraqi insurgents last month .
the last photo of a series the newspaper published showed one of the insurgents holding berg 's head after the beheading .
according to the press council , printing that picture was a inappropriate instance of sensationalism which did nothing to add to the journalistic value of the story .
according to the bonn-based body , berg 's murderers intentionally recorded the beheading to spread fear .
bild 's publication of those pictures , said the council , supported those aims .
the paper also received a reprimand for its publication of pictures from the scene of the killing by israeli of hamas leader sheikh ahmed yassin in march .
the newspaper published a photo showing yassin 's head , which was lacerated and had been separated from his body .
the press council said the picture was sensationalistic and not in the public interest . dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .

the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc german tabloid reprimanded for beheading photos germany 's best-selling newspaper , bild , has been publicly reprimanded by the country 's press council because of the publication of photos showing the murder of the american businessman nicholas berg , who was beheaded on video by iraqi insurgents last month .
the last photo of a series the newspaper published showed one of the insurgents holding berg 's head after the beheading .
according to the press council , printing that picture was a inappropriate instance of sensationalism which did nothing to add to the journalistic value of the story .
according to the bonn-based body , berg 's murderers intentionally recorded the beheading to spread fear .
bild 's publication of those pictures , said the council , supported those aims .
the paper also received a reprimand for its publication of pictures from the scene of the killing by israeli of hamas leader sheikh ahmed yassin in march .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.06.2004 -pipe- 12:00 utc postbank ipo could be postponed deutsche post ag , europe 's largest postal service , has said it can not rule out postponing the initial public offering of its subsidiary , deutsche postbank ag , which was scheduled for monday .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .

the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .

dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .

the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .

dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne survived 80 days of imprisonment in the cellar dungeon of marc dutroux came face to face with the convicted child rapist for the first time since 1996 while giving her testimony at the court of justice in arlon , belgium .
dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .
they were protesting against the bungling of authorities .
two government ministers and a police chief resigned . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de survivors take stand at dutroux trial nearly two months into the trial of accused child abductor and murderer marc dutroux , two of his surviving victims - now young women - are scheduled to testify this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 -pipe- 16:00 utc german tabloid reprimanded for beheading photos germany 's best-selling newspaper , bild , has been publicly reprimanded by the country 's press council because of the publication of photos showing the murder of the american businessman nicholas berg , who was beheaded on video by iraqi insurgents last month .
the last photo of a series the newspaper published showed one of the insurgents holding berg 's head after the beheading .
according to the press council , printing that picture was a inappropriate instance of sensationalism which did nothing to add to the journalistic value of the story .
according to the bonn-based body , berg 's murderers intentionally recorded the beheading to spread fear .
bild 's publication of those pictures , said the council , supported those aims .
the paper also received a reprimand for its publication of pictures from the scene of the killing by israeli of hamas leader sheikh ahmed yassin in march .
the newspaper published a photo showing yassin 's head , which was lacerated and had been separated from his body .
the press council said the picture was sensationalistic and not in the public interest . dw-world.de to show or not to show the online publication of a video showing the beheading of an american has again raised the question of whether media outlets should show the pictures to inform the public or refrain from doing so for ethical reasons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.06.2004 -pipe- 09:00 utc pro-european centrist group in parliament in the making liberal group leader graham watson and head of the french centrist udf party francois bayrou have agreed to proceed with plans to create a new centrist political group in the european parliament .
plans to create such a group are taking shape after a meeting held wednesday between the two men , where they agreed to finalize the program of this new group by the end of this month .
" we are working to create a new group in the european parliament which brings together those coming from the liberal family and from the democratic family " , bayrou told journalists after the meeting with graham watson .
" this new group will have a key role in the parliament , because we hope that it surpasses the number of 80 meps coming from at least 18 or 20 countries . "
the liberal group in the european parliament currently has 67 meps , making it the third largest group after the center-right epp and the socialist pes .
the new group is hoping to get some other parties on board , such as regionalist parties and other meps dissatisfied with the epp .
" our intention is to demonstrate that at the european parliament there will be a group which will maintain a clear pro-european vision , contrary to the other principle group which has a blocked vision since it is divided between the pro and anti-europeans " , bayrou added .
the epp , which emerged in recent elections as the biggest group in the european parliament , risks finding itself deserted by its core federalists and left with a strong euroskeptic element with the uk conservatives and the euroskeptic czech party ods under its umbrella .

plans to create such a group are taking shape after a meeting held wednesday between the two men , where they agreed to finalize the program of this new group by the end of this month .
" we are working to create a new group in the european parliament which brings together those coming from the liberal family and from the democratic family " , bayrou told journalists after the meeting with graham watson .
" this new group will have a key role in the parliament , because we hope that it surpasses the number of 80 meps coming from at least 18 or 20 countries . "
the liberal group in the european parliament currently has 67 meps , making it the third largest group after the center-right epp and the socialist pes .
the new group is hoping to get some other parties on board , such as regionalist parties and other meps dissatisfied with the epp .
" our intention is to demonstrate that at the european parliament there will be a group which will maintain a clear pro-european vision , contrary to the other principle group which has a blocked vision since it is divided between the pro and anti-europeans " , bayrou added .
the epp , which emerged in recent elections as the biggest group in the european parliament , risks finding itself deserted by its core federalists and left with a strong euroskeptic element with the uk conservatives and the euroskeptic czech party ods under its umbrella .

speaking to journalists wednesday , commission president romano prodi said , " this was a particularly poor turnout , and we are very concerned about this .
we will have to take this into account as we examine the implications of the european elections . "
less than half of the electorate expressed their views at the ballot box - an all-time low - and in some new member states , the turnout was closer to 20 percent .
but prodi dismissed the notion that low turnout in the newer members of the eu club was due to dissatisfaction with brussels .
" of course , in the commission , we are going to analyze these aspects in depth , but it would not appear that low turnout in the new member states is linked to any lack of satisfaction .
dissatisfaction seems to be reducing , " he said .
earlier in the week , the dutch state secretary for european affairs , atzo nicolaï , announced that the dutch , who will assume the rotating eu presidency in july , would organize a conference in october on the issue of why turnout for the elections was so low .
ministers and state secretaries for european affairs of all member states will convene to assess the causes of the different turnout figures and the varying communication strategies .
" the goal is to learn lessons from each other in order to improve the turnout in the next elections " , frits kemperman , dutch spokesman , told the euobserver .

speaking to journalists wednesday , commission president romano prodi said , " this was a particularly poor turnout , and we are very concerned about this .
we will have to take this into account as we examine the implications of the european elections . "
less than half of the electorate expressed their views at the ballot box - an all-time low - and in some new member states , the turnout was closer to 20 percent .
but prodi dismissed the notion that low turnout in the newer members of the eu club was due to dissatisfaction with brussels .
" of course , in the commission , we are going to analyze these aspects in depth , but it would not appear that low turnout in the new member states is linked to any lack of satisfaction .
dissatisfaction seems to be reducing , " he said .
earlier in the week , the dutch state secretary for european affairs , atzo nicolaï , announced that the dutch , who will assume the rotating eu presidency in july , would organize a conference in october on the issue of why turnout for the elections was so low .
ministers and state secretaries for european affairs of all member states will convene to assess the causes of the different turnout figures and the varying communication strategies .
" the goal is to learn lessons from each other in order to improve the turnout in the next elections " , frits kemperman , dutch spokesman , told the euobserver .

speaking to journalists wednesday , commission president romano prodi said , " this was a particularly poor turnout , and we are very concerned about this .
we will have to take this into account as we examine the implications of the european elections . "
less than half of the electorate expressed their views at the ballot box - an all-time low - and in some new member states , the turnout was closer to 20 percent .
but prodi dismissed the notion that low turnout in the newer members of the eu club was due to dissatisfaction with brussels .
" of course , in the commission , we are going to analyze these aspects in depth , but it would not appear that low turnout in the new member states is linked to any lack of satisfaction .
dissatisfaction seems to be reducing , " he said .
earlier in the week , the dutch state secretary for european affairs , atzo nicolaï , announced that the dutch , who will assume the rotating eu presidency in july , would organize a conference in october on the issue of why turnout for the elections was so low .
ministers and state secretaries for european affairs of all member states will convene to assess the causes of the different turnout figures and the varying communication strategies .
" the goal is to learn lessons from each other in order to improve the turnout in the next elections " , frits kemperman , dutch spokesman , told the euobserver .

the epp , the biggest group in the parliament , met with the liberals wednesday on the issue , but a source said a deal is expected to be made with the socialists .
epp sources expected that the group would decide thursday to split the five-year presidency between themselves and the socialists , with the socialists in power for the first two and a half years and the center-right for the more influential second half of the term .
hans-gert pöttering is expected to take over for the center-right .
the two political groups are also set to make a pact to make progress in other areas , such as the disputed question of the meps ' pay system which has been a controversial issue in recent weeks .
on wednesday , the head of the french socialists delegation , pervench beres , said " the technical accord between the european socialist party and the european people 's party will be finalized on thursday . "
however , some cautioned against being too hasty .

the leader of the socialist party , poul nyrup rasmussen and head of the socialist group -lrb- pes -rrb- in the parliament , enrique baron crespo , will meet their european people party 's -lrb- epp -rrb- counterparts , wilfried martens and hans-gert pöttering , thursday to try to hammer out an agreement .
the epp , the biggest group in the parliament , met with the liberals wednesday on the issue , but a source said a deal is expected to be made with the socialists .
epp sources expected that the group would decide thursday to split the five-year presidency between themselves and the socialists , with the socialists in power for the first two and a half years and the center-right for the more influential second half of the term .
hans-gert pöttering is expected to take over for the center-right .
the two political groups are also set to make a pact to make progress in other areas , such as the disputed question of the meps ' pay system which has been a controversial issue in recent weeks .
on wednesday , the head of the french socialists delegation , pervench beres , said " the technical accord between the european socialist party and the european people 's party will be finalized on thursday . "
however , some cautioned against being too hasty .
" this still has be discussed with the whole of the socialist group , " said a pes insider .
" we are not there yet . "
at the moment , the names most frequently mentioned for a socialist president are uk labor mep terry wynn , former french prime minister michel rocard and former french foreign minister pierre moscovici .

they 'll be attempting to agree on a constitution for the eu and considering candidates for the next european commission president . european leaders are hoping they 'll have better luck when they try to agree on the eu constitution the second time around .
six months ago , talks on the constitution collapsed amid arguments over the member states ' voting powers . today , thanks to efforts by the eu 's irish presidency to work out a compromise package on the main sticking points , the member states are closer to agreement .
" a result is possible , " said klaus hänsch , one of the european parliament 's two representatives negotiating the constitution with the eu 's council of ministers .
" on monday , it was once again obvious that all delegations had a strong will to reach agreement . " at the december summit , both poland and spain blocked the agreement over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent . in addition , the new draft proposes a minimum of six seats per country in the european parliament - a move aimed at reassuring smaller eu countries who fear their voice would be lost in the 732-seat assembly . presidential candidates another of the main issues for the summit to resolve is who will replace romano prodi as president of the european commission in november .
for many , the selection procedure is as complicated as that used by the vatican to choose a pope .
the range of names made public has been narrowed down over the past few months .
one of the top choices is rumored to be belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who has the backing of france and germany , the eu 's traditional powerbrokers . other matters up for discussion are the size and function of the european commission , as well as its powers to enforce the euro-zone 's budget rules .
talks also continue to be animated by the question of whether or not to mention europe 's christian heritage in the constitution 's preamble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 german parties reach immigration law agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's make a deal : schily -lrb- left -rrb- and his opponent stoiber finally reach an accord germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . the deal summed up nearly four years of inter-party wrangling over how to regulate immigration , promote the integration of newcomers into german society and replace a patchwork of rules with a modern law meant to signal openness and tolerance .
but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 german parties reach immigration law agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's make a deal : schily -lrb- left -rrb- and his opponent stoiber finally reach an accord germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . the deal summed up nearly four years of inter-party wrangling over how to regulate immigration , promote the integration of newcomers into german society and replace a patchwork of rules with a modern law meant to signal openness and tolerance .
but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 an unlikely combination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives are considering sharing the stage the latest election victories for germany 's left-wing , ecologist green party have the conservative opposition parties re-thinking their strategy .
is it possible to work together after all ? not so long ago , the very idea of cooperation between the greens and the conservative parties would have been unthinkable .
but following a string of strong election gains by the greens , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have begun to see the greens as a force to be reckoned with . leading cdu and csu politicians have said they plan to reconsider their strategy toward the greens following the summer break .
but whether the conservative 's new approach will involve courting the party of foreign minister joschka fischer as a potential coalition partner or fighting harder to stunt their growing popularity remains to be seen . " we have to come to grips with how we 're going to deal with the greens in the future , " said cdu parliamentarian volker kauder .
his primary concern , however , was not how to win the greens as a coalition partner .
instead , he said the cdu needs to think about how best to challenge the greens and analyze how the party appeals to growing numbers of voters , especially in large cities such as berlin and hamburg . gains for greens during last weekend 's elections for the european parliament , the greens managed to push its coalition partner in the federal government , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , out of second place in several cities .
in berlin , for example , they had the second strongest showing after the cdu .
in freiburg - the only large german city with a green mayor - the greens captured the top spot . many of the cdu 's younger members have already grown accustomed to the idea of forming a coalition with the greens .
" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .
the cdu 's head in the state of north rhine-westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , said his party has to stop fighting for the votes of spd supporters and start fighting for those of greens supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- party parliamentary floor leader michael glos one of the csu 's leading politicians , michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he sees opportunities for coalitions with the greens on a state level , but he drew the line at a coalition on a federal level , using a rather unflattering metaphor .
" in order for ticks to survive in the long term , they have to find a new host animal , " glos said .

" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .
the cdu 's head in the state of north rhine-westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , said his party has to stop fighting for the votes of spd supporters and start fighting for those of greens supporters .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal , right , and his wife betty marchal , left , leaf through a newspaper with marc dutroux on the cover in front of the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday march 1 , 2004 .
the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne survived 80 days of imprisonment in the cellar dungeon of marc dutroux came face to face with the convicted child rapist for the first time since 1996 while giving her testimony at the court of justice in arlon , belgium .
dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .
they were protesting against the bungling of authorities .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 government-industry trainee job pact draws criticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congratulatory handshakes sealed the pact on wednesday the ink has barely dried on the trainee job pact signed by german government and industry leaders , and already there 's criticism that the agreement is n't all it 's cracked up to be . the atmosphere on wednesday as industry and government representatives gathered to sign the pact aimed at redressing germany 's lack of trainee jobs for young graduates was celebratory . " this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding . " of course we 'll work hard to keep to what we 've promised , but there are no guarantees , " he told the financial times deutschland newspaper . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany passes controversial traineeship law german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .

the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .

but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .

but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .

the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .

the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .

dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "

germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation .

but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding . " of course we 'll work hard to keep to what we 've promised , but there are no guarantees , " he told the financial times deutschland newspaper . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany passes controversial traineeship law german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .

they 'll be attempting to agree on a constitution for the eu and considering candidates for the next european commission president . european leaders are hoping they 'll have better luck when they try to agree on the eu constitution the second time around .
six months ago , talks on the constitution collapsed amid arguments over the member states ' voting powers . today , thanks to efforts by the eu 's irish presidency to work out a compromise package on the main sticking points , the member states are closer to agreement .
" a result is possible , " said klaus hänsch , one of the european parliament 's two representatives negotiating the constitution with the eu 's council of ministers .
" on monday , it was once again obvious that all delegations had a strong will to reach agreement . " at the december summit , both poland and spain blocked the agreement over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent . in addition , the new draft proposes a minimum of six seats per country in the european parliament - a move aimed at reassuring smaller eu countries who fear their voice would be lost in the 732-seat assembly . presidential candidates another of the main issues for the summit to resolve is who will replace romano prodi as president of the european commission in november .
for many , the selection procedure is as complicated as that used by the vatican to choose a pope .
the range of names made public has been narrowed down over the past few months .
one of the top choices is rumored to be belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who has the backing of france and germany , the eu 's traditional powerbrokers . other matters up for discussion are the size and function of the european commission , as well as its powers to enforce the euro-zone 's budget rules .
talks also continue to be animated by the question of whether or not to mention europe 's christian heritage in the constitution 's preamble .

they 'll be attempting to agree on a constitution for the eu and considering candidates for the next european commission president . european leaders are hoping they 'll have better luck when they try to agree on the eu constitution the second time around .
six months ago , talks on the constitution collapsed amid arguments over the member states ' voting powers . today , thanks to efforts by the eu 's irish presidency to work out a compromise package on the main sticking points , the member states are closer to agreement .
" a result is possible , " said klaus hänsch , one of the european parliament 's two representatives negotiating the constitution with the eu 's council of ministers .
" on monday , it was once again obvious that all delegations had a strong will to reach agreement . " at the december summit , both poland and spain blocked the agreement over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent . in addition , the new draft proposes a minimum of six seats per country in the european parliament - a move aimed at reassuring smaller eu countries who fear their voice would be lost in the 732-seat assembly . presidential candidates another of the main issues for the summit to resolve is who will replace romano prodi as president of the european commission in november .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .

according to a spokesman for the isaf peacekeepers , the car that was attacked had been clearly marked with the international group 's insignia and german flags . while no peacekeepers were injured , the incident has set off a flurry of criticism in germany from opposition politicians .
they are demanding a change in strategy and questioning whether the soldiers ' presence is enough to secure peace in the region , which until the past few weeks , had been counted among the country 's more stable areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schmidt christian schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defense policy spokesman for the conservative parliamentary group made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the attempt " to bring stability solely through the presence of uniformed soldiers " had failed . he called for stepping up intelligence-gathering to find out why attacks have begun to be directed at german soldiers .
he also demanded that the german parliament , the bundestag , should be the one to decide whether more german soldiers should be sent to the town of faizabad as another prt .
the government has not planned on seeking parliamentary approval for the deployment . according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , the dutch defense ministry has confirmed that a planned dutch-german prt for faizabad has been shelved .
the ministry said the dutch want to concentrate their efforts on other regions . the reconstruction team in kunduz comprises 200 german army soldiers , along with a small number of civilian assistants .
its task is to stabilize the region in preparation for afghan elections scheduled for september .
compared to other regions in the country , many of which are still under the control of tribal warlords , kunduz has been relatively calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the chinese workers wounded in the terrorist attack in kunduz .

" difficult situation on the ground however , the head of the association of the federal armed forces , bernhard gertz , told the netzeitung internet news site that the concept of regional reconstruction teams should be reviewed to see whether it " offers the guarantee that orderly elections can be carried out in afghanistan . "
he warned about putting too pretty a face on the " rather critical " situation on the ground , in which the army can " no longer move freely around without armored vehicles . " afghanistan 's reconstruction minister , amin farhang , told germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that more forces are needed on the ground right now in order to ensure that elections in the fall take place .
he wants to see the numbers of peacekeepers in the country increased from its present 6,400 to up to 10,000 .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ?

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

is it possible to work together after all ? not so long ago , the very idea of cooperation between the greens and the conservative parties would have been unthinkable .
but following a string of strong election gains by the greens , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have begun to see the greens as a force to be reckoned with . leading cdu and csu politicians have said they plan to reconsider their strategy toward the greens following the summer break .
but whether the conservative 's new approach will involve courting the party of foreign minister joschka fischer as a potential coalition partner or fighting harder to stunt their growing popularity remains to be seen . " we have to come to grips with how we 're going to deal with the greens in the future , " said cdu parliamentarian volker kauder .
his primary concern , however , was not how to win the greens as a coalition partner .
instead , he said the cdu needs to think about how best to challenge the greens and analyze how the party appeals to growing numbers of voters , especially in large cities such as berlin and hamburg . gains for greens during last weekend 's elections for the european parliament , the greens managed to push its coalition partner in the federal government , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , out of second place in several cities .

in freiburg - the only large german city with a green mayor - the greens captured the top spot . many of the cdu 's younger members have already grown accustomed to the idea of forming a coalition with the greens .
" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .
the cdu 's head in the state of north rhine-westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , said his party has to stop fighting for the votes of spd supporters and start fighting for those of greens supporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 an unlikely combination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives are considering sharing the stage the latest election victories for germany 's left-wing , ecologist green party have the conservative opposition parties re-thinking their strategy .
is it possible to work together after all ? not so long ago , the very idea of cooperation between the greens and the conservative parties would have been unthinkable .
but following a string of strong election gains by the greens , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have begun to see the greens as a force to be reckoned with . leading cdu and csu politicians have said they plan to reconsider their strategy toward the greens following the summer break .
but whether the conservative 's new approach will involve courting the party of foreign minister joschka fischer as a potential coalition partner or fighting harder to stunt their growing popularity remains to be seen . " we have to come to grips with how we 're going to deal with the greens in the future , " said cdu parliamentarian volker kauder .
his primary concern , however , was not how to win the greens as a coalition partner .
instead , he said the cdu needs to think about how best to challenge the greens and analyze how the party appeals to growing numbers of voters , especially in large cities such as berlin and hamburg . gains for greens during last weekend 's elections for the european parliament , the greens managed to push its coalition partner in the federal government , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , out of second place in several cities .
in berlin , for example , they had the second strongest showing after the cdu .
in freiburg - the only large german city with a green mayor - the greens captured the top spot . many of the cdu 's younger members have already grown accustomed to the idea of forming a coalition with the greens .
" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .
the cdu 's head in the state of north rhine-westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , said his party has to stop fighting for the votes of spd supporters and start fighting for those of greens supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- party parliamentary floor leader michael glos one of the csu 's leading politicians , michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he sees opportunities for coalitions with the greens on a state level , but he drew the line at a coalition on a federal level , using a rather unflattering metaphor .
" in order for ticks to survive in the long term , they have to find a new host animal , " glos said .
" i do n't want us to become that new host animal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 german parties reach immigration law agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's make a deal : schily -lrb- left -rrb- and his opponent stoiber finally reach an accord germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . the deal summed up nearly four years of inter-party wrangling over how to regulate immigration , promote the integration of newcomers into german society and replace a patchwork of rules with a modern law meant to signal openness and tolerance .
but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .

the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures .
-lrb- may 30 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2005 -rrb- fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?

is it possible to work together after all ? not so long ago , the very idea of cooperation between the greens and the conservative parties would have been unthinkable .
but following a string of strong election gains by the greens , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have begun to see the greens as a force to be reckoned with . leading cdu and csu politicians have said they plan to reconsider their strategy toward the greens following the summer break .
but whether the conservative 's new approach will involve courting the party of foreign minister joschka fischer as a potential coalition partner or fighting harder to stunt their growing popularity remains to be seen . " we have to come to grips with how we 're going to deal with the greens in the future , " said cdu parliamentarian volker kauder .
his primary concern , however , was not how to win the greens as a coalition partner .
instead , he said the cdu needs to think about how best to challenge the greens and analyze how the party appeals to growing numbers of voters , especially in large cities such as berlin and hamburg . gains for greens during last weekend 's elections for the european parliament , the greens managed to push its coalition partner in the federal government , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , out of second place in several cities .
in berlin , for example , they had the second strongest showing after the cdu .
in freiburg - the only large german city with a green mayor - the greens captured the top spot . many of the cdu 's younger members have already grown accustomed to the idea of forming a coalition with the greens .
" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .
the cdu 's head in the state of north rhine-westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , said his party has to stop fighting for the votes of spd supporters and start fighting for those of greens supporters .

they 'll be attempting to agree on a constitution for the eu and considering candidates for the next european commission president . european leaders are hoping they 'll have better luck when they try to agree on the eu constitution the second time around .
six months ago , talks on the constitution collapsed amid arguments over the member states ' voting powers . today , thanks to efforts by the eu 's irish presidency to work out a compromise package on the main sticking points , the member states are closer to agreement .
" a result is possible , " said klaus hänsch , one of the european parliament 's two representatives negotiating the constitution with the eu 's council of ministers .
" on monday , it was once again obvious that all delegations had a strong will to reach agreement . " at the december summit , both poland and spain blocked the agreement over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent . in addition , the new draft proposes a minimum of six seats per country in the european parliament - a move aimed at reassuring smaller eu countries who fear their voice would be lost in the 732-seat assembly . presidential candidates another of the main issues for the summit to resolve is who will replace romano prodi as president of the european commission in november .
for many , the selection procedure is as complicated as that used by the vatican to choose a pope .

one of the top choices is rumored to be belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who has the backing of france and germany , the eu 's traditional powerbrokers . other matters up for discussion are the size and function of the european commission , as well as its powers to enforce the euro-zone 's budget rules .

he also demanded that the german parliament , the bundestag , should be the one to decide whether more german soldiers should be sent to the town of faizabad as another prt .
the government has not planned on seeking parliamentary approval for the deployment . according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , the dutch defense ministry has confirmed that a planned dutch-german prt for faizabad has been shelved .

" afghanistan 's reconstruction minister , amin farhang , told germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that more forces are needed on the ground right now in order to ensure that elections in the fall take place .
he wants to see the numbers of peacekeepers in the country increased from its present 6,400 to up to 10,000 .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal , right , and his wife betty marchal , left , leaf through a newspaper with marc dutroux on the cover in front of the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday march 1 , 2004 .
the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne survived 80 days of imprisonment in the cellar dungeon of marc dutroux came face to face with the convicted child rapist for the first time since 1996 while giving her testimony at the court of justice in arlon , belgium .
dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .
they were protesting against the bungling of authorities .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .

the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .

dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .

the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 german parties reach immigration law agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's make a deal : schily -lrb- left -rrb- and his opponent stoiber finally reach an accord germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . the deal summed up nearly four years of inter-party wrangling over how to regulate immigration , promote the integration of newcomers into german society and replace a patchwork of rules with a modern law meant to signal openness and tolerance .
but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures .
-lrb- may 30 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2005 -rrb- fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?
the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 17.06.2004 training the champions of the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new hi-tech training scheme aims to develop the skills of germany 's stars of the future .
by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal , right , and his wife betty marchal , left , leaf through a newspaper with marc dutroux on the cover in front of the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday march 1 , 2004 .
the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne survived 80 days of imprisonment in the cellar dungeon of marc dutroux came face to face with the convicted child rapist for the first time since 1996 while giving her testimony at the court of justice in arlon , belgium .
dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .
they were protesting against the bungling of authorities .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding . " of course we 'll work hard to keep to what we 've promised , but there are no guarantees , " he told the financial times deutschland newspaper . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany passes controversial traineeship law german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .

the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .

the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .

according to a spokesman for the isaf peacekeepers , the car that was attacked had been clearly marked with the international group 's insignia and german flags . while no peacekeepers were injured , the incident has set off a flurry of criticism in germany from opposition politicians .
they are demanding a change in strategy and questioning whether the soldiers ' presence is enough to secure peace in the region , which until the past few weeks , had been counted among the country 's more stable areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schmidt christian schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defense policy spokesman for the conservative parliamentary group made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the attempt " to bring stability solely through the presence of uniformed soldiers " had failed . he called for stepping up intelligence-gathering to find out why attacks have begun to be directed at german soldiers .
he also demanded that the german parliament , the bundestag , should be the one to decide whether more german soldiers should be sent to the town of faizabad as another prt .
the government has not planned on seeking parliamentary approval for the deployment . according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , the dutch defense ministry has confirmed that a planned dutch-german prt for faizabad has been shelved .
the ministry said the dutch want to concentrate their efforts on other regions . the reconstruction team in kunduz comprises 200 german army soldiers , along with a small number of civilian assistants .
its task is to stabilize the region in preparation for afghan elections scheduled for september .
compared to other regions in the country , many of which are still under the control of tribal warlords , kunduz has been relatively calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the chinese workers wounded in the terrorist attack in kunduz .
however , the image was shattered last week when 11 chinese workers were killed and several injured in an early morning attack by militants on their compound . the social democratic-led government has strongly rejected calls to switch gears in the region .
social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- foreign policy expert gernot erler told the berliner zeitung the opposition criticism was " unsound , especially when they do n't say what they want to do . " difficult situation on the ground however , the head of the association of the federal armed forces , bernhard gertz , told the netzeitung internet news site that the concept of regional reconstruction teams should be reviewed to see whether it " offers the guarantee that orderly elections can be carried out in afghanistan . "
he warned about putting too pretty a face on the " rather critical " situation on the ground , in which the army can " no longer move freely around without armored vehicles . " afghanistan 's reconstruction minister , amin farhang , told germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that more forces are needed on the ground right now in order to ensure that elections in the fall take place .
he wants to see the numbers of peacekeepers in the country increased from its present 6,400 to up to 10,000 . " if the germans especially would enlarge their already strong presence as part of the nato force , we would be very happy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding . " of course we 'll work hard to keep to what we 've promised , but there are no guarantees , " he told the financial times deutschland newspaper . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany passes controversial traineeship law german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding . " of course we 'll work hard to keep to what we 've promised , but there are no guarantees , " he told the financial times deutschland newspaper . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany passes controversial traineeship law german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .

stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

according to a spokesman for the isaf peacekeepers , the car that was attacked had been clearly marked with the international group 's insignia and german flags . while no peacekeepers were injured , the incident has set off a flurry of criticism in germany from opposition politicians .
they are demanding a change in strategy and questioning whether the soldiers ' presence is enough to secure peace in the region , which until the past few weeks , had been counted among the country 's more stable areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schmidt christian schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defense policy spokesman for the conservative parliamentary group made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the attempt " to bring stability solely through the presence of uniformed soldiers " had failed . he called for stepping up intelligence-gathering to find out why attacks have begun to be directed at german soldiers .
he also demanded that the german parliament , the bundestag , should be the one to decide whether more german soldiers should be sent to the town of faizabad as another prt .
the government has not planned on seeking parliamentary approval for the deployment . according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , the dutch defense ministry has confirmed that a planned dutch-german prt for faizabad has been shelved .
the ministry said the dutch want to concentrate their efforts on other regions . the reconstruction team in kunduz comprises 200 german army soldiers , along with a small number of civilian assistants .
its task is to stabilize the region in preparation for afghan elections scheduled for september .
compared to other regions in the country , many of which are still under the control of tribal warlords , kunduz has been relatively calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the chinese workers wounded in the terrorist attack in kunduz .
however , the image was shattered last week when 11 chinese workers were killed and several injured in an early morning attack by militants on their compound . the social democratic-led government has strongly rejected calls to switch gears in the region .
social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- foreign policy expert gernot erler told the berliner zeitung the opposition criticism was " unsound , especially when they do n't say what they want to do . " difficult situation on the ground however , the head of the association of the federal armed forces , bernhard gertz , told the netzeitung internet news site that the concept of regional reconstruction teams should be reviewed to see whether it " offers the guarantee that orderly elections can be carried out in afghanistan . "
he warned about putting too pretty a face on the " rather critical " situation on the ground , in which the army can " no longer move freely around without armored vehicles . " afghanistan 's reconstruction minister , amin farhang , told germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that more forces are needed on the ground right now in order to ensure that elections in the fall take place .
he wants to see the numbers of peacekeepers in the country increased from its present 6,400 to up to 10,000 . " if the germans especially would enlarge their already strong presence as part of the nato force , we would be very happy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

six months ago , talks on the constitution collapsed amid arguments over the member states ' voting powers . today , thanks to efforts by the eu 's irish presidency to work out a compromise package on the main sticking points , the member states are closer to agreement .

they are demanding a change in strategy and questioning whether the soldiers ' presence is enough to secure peace in the region , which until the past few weeks , had been counted among the country 's more stable areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schmidt christian schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defense policy spokesman for the conservative parliamentary group made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the attempt " to bring stability solely through the presence of uniformed soldiers " had failed . he called for stepping up intelligence-gathering to find out why attacks have begun to be directed at german soldiers .
he also demanded that the german parliament , the bundestag , should be the one to decide whether more german soldiers should be sent to the town of faizabad as another prt .
the government has not planned on seeking parliamentary approval for the deployment . according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , the dutch defense ministry has confirmed that a planned dutch-german prt for faizabad has been shelved .

" afghanistan 's reconstruction minister , amin farhang , told germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that more forces are needed on the ground right now in order to ensure that elections in the fall take place .
he wants to see the numbers of peacekeepers in the country increased from its present 6,400 to up to 10,000 .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .

according to a spokesman for the isaf peacekeepers , the car that was attacked had been clearly marked with the international group 's insignia and german flags . while no peacekeepers were injured , the incident has set off a flurry of criticism in germany from opposition politicians .
they are demanding a change in strategy and questioning whether the soldiers ' presence is enough to secure peace in the region , which until the past few weeks , had been counted among the country 's more stable areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schmidt christian schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defense policy spokesman for the conservative parliamentary group made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the attempt " to bring stability solely through the presence of uniformed soldiers " had failed . he called for stepping up intelligence-gathering to find out why attacks have begun to be directed at german soldiers .
he also demanded that the german parliament , the bundestag , should be the one to decide whether more german soldiers should be sent to the town of faizabad as another prt .
the government has not planned on seeking parliamentary approval for the deployment . according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , the dutch defense ministry has confirmed that a planned dutch-german prt for faizabad has been shelved .
the ministry said the dutch want to concentrate their efforts on other regions . the reconstruction team in kunduz comprises 200 german army soldiers , along with a small number of civilian assistants .
its task is to stabilize the region in preparation for afghan elections scheduled for september .
compared to other regions in the country , many of which are still under the control of tribal warlords , kunduz has been relatively calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the chinese workers wounded in the terrorist attack in kunduz .
however , the image was shattered last week when 11 chinese workers were killed and several injured in an early morning attack by militants on their compound . the social democratic-led government has strongly rejected calls to switch gears in the region .
social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- foreign policy expert gernot erler told the berliner zeitung the opposition criticism was " unsound , especially when they do n't say what they want to do . " difficult situation on the ground however , the head of the association of the federal armed forces , bernhard gertz , told the netzeitung internet news site that the concept of regional reconstruction teams should be reviewed to see whether it " offers the guarantee that orderly elections can be carried out in afghanistan . "
he warned about putting too pretty a face on the " rather critical " situation on the ground , in which the army can " no longer move freely around without armored vehicles . " afghanistan 's reconstruction minister , amin farhang , told germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that more forces are needed on the ground right now in order to ensure that elections in the fall take place .
he wants to see the numbers of peacekeepers in the country increased from its present 6,400 to up to 10,000 . " if the germans especially would enlarge their already strong presence as part of the nato force , we would be very happy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 german parties reach immigration law agreement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : let 's make a deal : schily -lrb- left -rrb- and his opponent stoiber finally reach an accord germany 's government and opposition have hammered out a difficult compromise the country 's long-awaited immigration law aimed at admitting foreign workers and protecting asylum seekers . the deal summed up nearly four years of inter-party wrangling over how to regulate immigration , promote the integration of newcomers into german society and replace a patchwork of rules with a modern law meant to signal openness and tolerance .
but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 an unlikely combination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives are considering sharing the stage the latest election victories for germany 's left-wing , ecologist green party have the conservative opposition parties re-thinking their strategy .
is it possible to work together after all ? not so long ago , the very idea of cooperation between the greens and the conservative parties would have been unthinkable .
but following a string of strong election gains by the greens , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have begun to see the greens as a force to be reckoned with . leading cdu and csu politicians have said they plan to reconsider their strategy toward the greens following the summer break .
but whether the conservative 's new approach will involve courting the party of foreign minister joschka fischer as a potential coalition partner or fighting harder to stunt their growing popularity remains to be seen . " we have to come to grips with how we 're going to deal with the greens in the future , " said cdu parliamentarian volker kauder .
his primary concern , however , was not how to win the greens as a coalition partner .
instead , he said the cdu needs to think about how best to challenge the greens and analyze how the party appeals to growing numbers of voters , especially in large cities such as berlin and hamburg . gains for greens during last weekend 's elections for the european parliament , the greens managed to push its coalition partner in the federal government , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , out of second place in several cities .
in berlin , for example , they had the second strongest showing after the cdu .
in freiburg - the only large german city with a green mayor - the greens captured the top spot . many of the cdu 's younger members have already grown accustomed to the idea of forming a coalition with the greens .
" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .
the cdu 's head in the state of north rhine-westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , said his party has to stop fighting for the votes of spd supporters and start fighting for those of greens supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- party parliamentary floor leader michael glos one of the csu 's leading politicians , michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he sees opportunities for coalitions with the greens on a state level , but he drew the line at a coalition on a federal level , using a rather unflattering metaphor .

they 'll be attempting to agree on a constitution for the eu and considering candidates for the next european commission president . european leaders are hoping they 'll have better luck when they try to agree on the eu constitution the second time around .
six months ago , talks on the constitution collapsed amid arguments over the member states ' voting powers . today , thanks to efforts by the eu 's irish presidency to work out a compromise package on the main sticking points , the member states are closer to agreement .
" a result is possible , " said klaus hänsch , one of the european parliament 's two representatives negotiating the constitution with the eu 's council of ministers .
" on monday , it was once again obvious that all delegations had a strong will to reach agreement . " at the december summit , both poland and spain blocked the agreement over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent . in addition , the new draft proposes a minimum of six seats per country in the european parliament - a move aimed at reassuring smaller eu countries who fear their voice would be lost in the 732-seat assembly . presidential candidates another of the main issues for the summit to resolve is who will replace romano prodi as president of the european commission in november .
for many , the selection procedure is as complicated as that used by the vatican to choose a pope .
the range of names made public has been narrowed down over the past few months .
one of the top choices is rumored to be belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who has the backing of france and germany , the eu 's traditional powerbrokers . other matters up for discussion are the size and function of the european commission , as well as its powers to enforce the euro-zone 's budget rules .
talks also continue to be animated by the question of whether or not to mention europe 's christian heritage in the constitution 's preamble .
eight countries led by poland and italy want to have a reference to europe 's religious heritage in the preamble ; france and belgium are opposed to any reference . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing a new eu commission president eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "

germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures .
-lrb- may 30 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2005 -rrb- fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?
the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details .

new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .

the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures .
-lrb- may 30 , 2004 -rrb- german experts warn of alarming lack of skilled workers german business leaders have largely welcomed the political breakthrough on immigration , but warn the government has to move quickly to translate words into action as germany faces a dramatic shortage of skilled labor . -lrb- may 29 , 2005 -rrb- fresh start for stalled german immigration talks ?
the german government agreed friday to try one last time to reach agreement on controversial immigration talks with the conservative opposition .
chancellor schröder is to meet the opposition to iron out details .
-lrb- may 7 , 2004 -rrb- greens abandon german immigration talks germany 's green party has pulled out of crucial talks on a new immigration law , citing irreconcilable differences with the conservative opposition .

but following a string of strong election gains by the greens , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have begun to see the greens as a force to be reckoned with . leading cdu and csu politicians have said they plan to reconsider their strategy toward the greens following the summer break .
but whether the conservative 's new approach will involve courting the party of foreign minister joschka fischer as a potential coalition partner or fighting harder to stunt their growing popularity remains to be seen . " we have to come to grips with how we 're going to deal with the greens in the future , " said cdu parliamentarian volker kauder .
his primary concern , however , was not how to win the greens as a coalition partner .
instead , he said the cdu needs to think about how best to challenge the greens and analyze how the party appeals to growing numbers of voters , especially in large cities such as berlin and hamburg . gains for greens during last weekend 's elections for the european parliament , the greens managed to push its coalition partner in the federal government , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , out of second place in several cities .

" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 an unlikely combination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives are considering sharing the stage the latest election victories for germany 's left-wing , ecologist green party have the conservative opposition parties re-thinking their strategy .
is it possible to work together after all ? not so long ago , the very idea of cooperation between the greens and the conservative parties would have been unthinkable .
but following a string of strong election gains by the greens , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have begun to see the greens as a force to be reckoned with . leading cdu and csu politicians have said they plan to reconsider their strategy toward the greens following the summer break .
but whether the conservative 's new approach will involve courting the party of foreign minister joschka fischer as a potential coalition partner or fighting harder to stunt their growing popularity remains to be seen . " we have to come to grips with how we 're going to deal with the greens in the future , " said cdu parliamentarian volker kauder .
his primary concern , however , was not how to win the greens as a coalition partner .
instead , he said the cdu needs to think about how best to challenge the greens and analyze how the party appeals to growing numbers of voters , especially in large cities such as berlin and hamburg . gains for greens during last weekend 's elections for the european parliament , the greens managed to push its coalition partner in the federal government , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , out of second place in several cities .
in berlin , for example , they had the second strongest showing after the cdu .
in freiburg - the only large german city with a green mayor - the greens captured the top spot . many of the cdu 's younger members have already grown accustomed to the idea of forming a coalition with the greens .
" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .
the cdu 's head in the state of north rhine-westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , said his party has to stop fighting for the votes of spd supporters and start fighting for those of greens supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- party parliamentary floor leader michael glos one of the csu 's leading politicians , michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he sees opportunities for coalitions with the greens on a state level , but he drew the line at a coalition on a federal level , using a rather unflattering metaphor .
" in order for ticks to survive in the long term , they have to find a new host animal , " glos said .

to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent . in addition , the new draft proposes a minimum of six seats per country in the european parliament - a move aimed at reassuring smaller eu countries who fear their voice would be lost in the 732-seat assembly . presidential candidates another of the main issues for the summit to resolve is who will replace romano prodi as president of the european commission in november .

they 'll be attempting to agree on a constitution for the eu and considering candidates for the next european commission president . european leaders are hoping they 'll have better luck when they try to agree on the eu constitution the second time around .
six months ago , talks on the constitution collapsed amid arguments over the member states ' voting powers . today , thanks to efforts by the eu 's irish presidency to work out a compromise package on the main sticking points , the member states are closer to agreement .
" a result is possible , " said klaus hänsch , one of the european parliament 's two representatives negotiating the constitution with the eu 's council of ministers .
" on monday , it was once again obvious that all delegations had a strong will to reach agreement . " at the december summit , both poland and spain blocked the agreement over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent . in addition , the new draft proposes a minimum of six seats per country in the european parliament - a move aimed at reassuring smaller eu countries who fear their voice would be lost in the 732-seat assembly . presidential candidates another of the main issues for the summit to resolve is who will replace romano prodi as president of the european commission in november .

according to a spokesman for the isaf peacekeepers , the car that was attacked had been clearly marked with the international group 's insignia and german flags . while no peacekeepers were injured , the incident has set off a flurry of criticism in germany from opposition politicians .
they are demanding a change in strategy and questioning whether the soldiers ' presence is enough to secure peace in the region , which until the past few weeks , had been counted among the country 's more stable areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schmidt christian schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defense policy spokesman for the conservative parliamentary group made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the attempt " to bring stability solely through the presence of uniformed soldiers " had failed . he called for stepping up intelligence-gathering to find out why attacks have begun to be directed at german soldiers .
he also demanded that the german parliament , the bundestag , should be the one to decide whether more german soldiers should be sent to the town of faizabad as another prt .
the government has not planned on seeking parliamentary approval for the deployment . according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , the dutch defense ministry has confirmed that a planned dutch-german prt for faizabad has been shelved .
the ministry said the dutch want to concentrate their efforts on other regions . the reconstruction team in kunduz comprises 200 german army soldiers , along with a small number of civilian assistants .
its task is to stabilize the region in preparation for afghan elections scheduled for september .

" difficult situation on the ground however , the head of the association of the federal armed forces , bernhard gertz , told the netzeitung internet news site that the concept of regional reconstruction teams should be reviewed to see whether it " offers the guarantee that orderly elections can be carried out in afghanistan . "
he warned about putting too pretty a face on the " rather critical " situation on the ground , in which the army can " no longer move freely around without armored vehicles . " afghanistan 's reconstruction minister , amin farhang , told germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that more forces are needed on the ground right now in order to ensure that elections in the fall take place .
he wants to see the numbers of peacekeepers in the country increased from its present 6,400 to up to 10,000 .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal , right , and his wife betty marchal , left , leaf through a newspaper with marc dutroux on the cover in front of the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday march 1 , 2004 .
the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne survived 80 days of imprisonment in the cellar dungeon of marc dutroux came face to face with the convicted child rapist for the first time since 1996 while giving her testimony at the court of justice in arlon , belgium .
dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .
they were protesting against the bungling of authorities .

the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .

the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .

dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .

the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .

according to a spokesman for the isaf peacekeepers , the car that was attacked had been clearly marked with the international group 's insignia and german flags . while no peacekeepers were injured , the incident has set off a flurry of criticism in germany from opposition politicians .
they are demanding a change in strategy and questioning whether the soldiers ' presence is enough to secure peace in the region , which until the past few weeks , had been counted among the country 's more stable areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schmidt christian schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defense policy spokesman for the conservative parliamentary group made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the attempt " to bring stability solely through the presence of uniformed soldiers " had failed . he called for stepping up intelligence-gathering to find out why attacks have begun to be directed at german soldiers .
he also demanded that the german parliament , the bundestag , should be the one to decide whether more german soldiers should be sent to the town of faizabad as another prt .
the government has not planned on seeking parliamentary approval for the deployment . according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , the dutch defense ministry has confirmed that a planned dutch-german prt for faizabad has been shelved .
the ministry said the dutch want to concentrate their efforts on other regions . the reconstruction team in kunduz comprises 200 german army soldiers , along with a small number of civilian assistants .
its task is to stabilize the region in preparation for afghan elections scheduled for september .
compared to other regions in the country , many of which are still under the control of tribal warlords , kunduz has been relatively calm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the chinese workers wounded in the terrorist attack in kunduz .
however , the image was shattered last week when 11 chinese workers were killed and several injured in an early morning attack by militants on their compound . the social democratic-led government has strongly rejected calls to switch gears in the region .
social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- foreign policy expert gernot erler told the berliner zeitung the opposition criticism was " unsound , especially when they do n't say what they want to do . " difficult situation on the ground however , the head of the association of the federal armed forces , bernhard gertz , told the netzeitung internet news site that the concept of regional reconstruction teams should be reviewed to see whether it " offers the guarantee that orderly elections can be carried out in afghanistan . "
he warned about putting too pretty a face on the " rather critical " situation on the ground , in which the army can " no longer move freely around without armored vehicles . " afghanistan 's reconstruction minister , amin farhang , told germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that more forces are needed on the ground right now in order to ensure that elections in the fall take place .
he wants to see the numbers of peacekeepers in the country increased from its present 6,400 to up to 10,000 . " if the germans especially would enlarge their already strong presence as part of the nato force , we would be very happy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rebuilding afghanistan and setting an example for iraq during his visit to afghanistan on tuesday , german foreign minister joschka fischer praised the work of german troops and said the reconstruction effort there should serve as a role model to iraq .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal , right , and his wife betty marchal , left , leaf through a newspaper with marc dutroux on the cover in front of the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday march 1 , 2004 .
the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne survived 80 days of imprisonment in the cellar dungeon of marc dutroux came face to face with the convicted child rapist for the first time since 1996 while giving her testimony at the court of justice in arlon , belgium .
dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .
they were protesting against the bungling of authorities .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .

the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .

dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.06.2004 an unlikely combination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives are considering sharing the stage the latest election victories for germany 's left-wing , ecologist green party have the conservative opposition parties re-thinking their strategy .
is it possible to work together after all ? not so long ago , the very idea of cooperation between the greens and the conservative parties would have been unthinkable .
but following a string of strong election gains by the greens , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have begun to see the greens as a force to be reckoned with . leading cdu and csu politicians have said they plan to reconsider their strategy toward the greens following the summer break .
but whether the conservative 's new approach will involve courting the party of foreign minister joschka fischer as a potential coalition partner or fighting harder to stunt their growing popularity remains to be seen . " we have to come to grips with how we 're going to deal with the greens in the future , " said cdu parliamentarian volker kauder .
his primary concern , however , was not how to win the greens as a coalition partner .
instead , he said the cdu needs to think about how best to challenge the greens and analyze how the party appeals to growing numbers of voters , especially in large cities such as berlin and hamburg . gains for greens during last weekend 's elections for the european parliament , the greens managed to push its coalition partner in the federal government , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , out of second place in several cities .
in berlin , for example , they had the second strongest showing after the cdu .
in freiburg - the only large german city with a green mayor - the greens captured the top spot . many of the cdu 's younger members have already grown accustomed to the idea of forming a coalition with the greens .
" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .
the cdu 's head in the state of north rhine-westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , said his party has to stop fighting for the votes of spd supporters and start fighting for those of greens supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- party parliamentary floor leader michael glos one of the csu 's leading politicians , michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he sees opportunities for coalitions with the greens on a state level , but he drew the line at a coalition on a federal level , using a rather unflattering metaphor .
" in order for ticks to survive in the long term , they have to find a new host animal , " glos said .
" i do n't want us to become that new host animal .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .

although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .

the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "

germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding .

numerous convictions dutroux could now face a sentence of life imprisonment for numerous counts of murder .
the court of justice in the southern belgian city of arlon issued a verdict on thursday convicting dutroux of killing two girls , one 17 and the other 19 , during the mid-1990s .
the judge in the case also said dutroux had killed his former accomplice in a child-kidnapping ring , bernard weinstein .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul marchal , right , and his wife betty marchal , left , leaf through a newspaper with marc dutroux on the cover in front of the palace of justice in arlon , belgium , monday march 1 , 2004 .
the 12-member jury also concluded after long deliberations that dutroux had led a criminal ring that had been responsible for the kidnapping , deprivation of liberty and rape of a total of six girls .
four of the girls - julie lejeune , melissa russo , an marchal and eefje lambrecks died while being held in captivity by dutroux .
throughout the trial , dutroux denied responsibility for the girl 's gruesome deaths .
during the closing arguments in his trial , dutroux claimed a pedophile ring forced him to kidnap the girls .
but despite speculation at the start of the trial , evidence never materialized that such a ring existed .
on thursday afternoon , the jury continued to read its numerous verdicts to dutroux .
if convicted on all counts , he will likely be sentenced to life in prison .
but a sentence will first be handed down after further deliberations .
dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .

dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .
they were protesting against the bungling of authorities .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding . " of course we 'll work hard to keep to what we 've promised , but there are no guarantees , " he told the financial times deutschland newspaper . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany passes controversial traineeship law german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .

dutroux 's former wife , michelle martin , and his accomplice , michel lelievre , are also expected to be given stiff prison sentences .
though not convicted of murder , the court held martin responsible for the deaths of julie and melissa , who starved while dutroux sat in jail .
nihoul acquitted though it convicted dutroux on thursday , the court 's three-judge panel acquitted businessman michel nihoul , who also stood accused as dutroux 's accomplice , after the jury failed to convict him .
prosecutors believed nihoul was the lynchpin of a pedophile gang , and took part in several abductions of girls .
but the judges ordered the jurors to reconsider whether the 63-year-old convicted fraudster was guilty of complicity in the crimes .
the trial of the century the trial , which began on march 1 , has sent shock waves far beyond belgium 's borders , is now approaching the end .
the jury on thursday issued verdicts on 243 charges against dutroux and his three co-defendants .
during the case , the court heard from more than 500 witnesses .
pleas from the co-plaintiffs , defense and prosecutors alone lasted more than 75 hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sabine dardenne survived 80 days of imprisonment in the cellar dungeon of marc dutroux came face to face with the convicted child rapist for the first time since 1996 while giving her testimony at the court of justice in arlon , belgium .
dominating headlines in belgium and europe for the greater part of the past decade , the dutroux scandal launched a serious domestic crisis in belgium during the 1990s , and the images of the two girls who survived their kidnappings , sabine dardenne -lrb- photo -rrb- and laetitia delhez , and were found in the cellar of dutroux 's house were broadcast and printed all over the world .
the case has haunted belgians since dutroux 's 1996 arrest .
the crimes not only made their country synonymous with pedophilia in the world 's eyes but also raised questions in people 's minds about the possible complicity of police and politicians .
given the bungled investigation into the missing girls , many belgians came to believe dutroux worked under the protection of a child sex ring whose members included influential people .
dutroux has played on that widely held belief , insisting that he was a reluctant accomplice to the ring .
the case brought 320,000 belgians on to the streets of brussels at the time in the biggest demonstration ever seen in the country .
they were protesting against the bungling of authorities .

" this is a good day for young people in germany , " chancellor gerhard schröder said at the signing ceremony in berlin . " this pact is a wonderful example of what can be achieved when we replace bureaucracy with a relationship between partners , " said ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce . a wide cross-section of the german media likewise applauded the agreement as a victory for all sides concerned . but amidst the shoulder patting , criticism could also be heard .
the loudest belonged to the dgb trade union association head , michael sommer , who said the solution was sorely inadequate . " there are 100,000 young people looking for an apprenticeship or on the waiting list for one , " he told the berliner zeitung newspaper . " and what does industry do ?
it talks about 30,000 apprenticeships , mixes in some offers to hire interns , and tries to talk the whole problem down . "
he said that introducing a law to regulate germany 's apprenticeship system was the only way to ensure that enough young people are receiving training for their future careers . system admired abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this graduate was fortunate to get an apprenticeship as an electrician .
germany 's apprenticeship system is often admired abroad for providing young people with a seamless transition from student life to the working world .
in many industries , apprenticeships are mandatory before young people can enter the work force , and they are thus highly sought after by youth .
but the system has been strained by three years of low economic growth , with companies cutting their trainee jobs in order to save costs .
at the end of april , figures showed that some 331,600 people had applied for 149,500 spots in german companies . for months , it looked as if the government would take the legal route to address the lack of trainee jobs for interested applicants .
it proposed a controversial new law that would force companies that did n't hire enough trainees to pay a fine into a nationwide traineeship fund .
the law passed the lower house of parliament , the bundestag , in may , and was due for a second vote in the upper house , the bundesrat .
but the government backed away from the law , in order to pursue the pact with industry associations . terms of the pact the major points of the new government-industry pact are as follows : * industry promises to provide an additional 30,000 apprenticeships annually over the next three years . * industry also promises to offer a further 25,000 work experience opportunities , the costs of which will be absorbed by the federal labor office . * the government will raise the number of traineeships in the federal civil service by 20 percent . * starting in september , the german chambers of industry and commerce and the labor office plan to invite young people who fail to get an apprenticeship for a so-called " competency check " to see if a placement can be found . keeping promises criticism of the pact could also be heard from within government ranks .
members of the social democrats ' left wing said it 's questionable whether individual companies will stick to the agreement . seeking to assuage critics , economics minister wolfgang clement said the government would closely monitor the success of the agreement , and said that the legal route was still an option . " we 'll see by the fall of next year whether some adjustments are needed , or whether legal procedures are needed , " he said .
" the law has only been put on hold , and it 'll stay that way as long as we have a successful cooperation . " the managing director of the german employers ' association , reinhard göhner , admitted that there was some risk involved in trying to resolve the traineeship crisis with a pact that is n't legally binding . " of course we 'll work hard to keep to what we 've promised , but there are no guarantees , " he told the financial times deutschland newspaper . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany passes controversial traineeship law german parliamentarians on friday voted in favor of a law to fine companies that do not hire enough apprentices .

they 'll be attempting to agree on a constitution for the eu and considering candidates for the next european commission president . european leaders are hoping they 'll have better luck when they try to agree on the eu constitution the second time around .
six months ago , talks on the constitution collapsed amid arguments over the member states ' voting powers . today , thanks to efforts by the eu 's irish presidency to work out a compromise package on the main sticking points , the member states are closer to agreement .
" a result is possible , " said klaus hänsch , one of the european parliament 's two representatives negotiating the constitution with the eu 's council of ministers .
" on monday , it was once again obvious that all delegations had a strong will to reach agreement . " at the december summit , both poland and spain blocked the agreement over fears that the proposed new voting system would give too much power to the most populous countries .
to meet their concerns , the eu 's presidency has proposed modifying the " double majority " voting principle .
instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent . in addition , the new draft proposes a minimum of six seats per country in the european parliament - a move aimed at reassuring smaller eu countries who fear their voice would be lost in the 732-seat assembly . presidential candidates another of the main issues for the summit to resolve is who will replace romano prodi as president of the european commission in november .
for many , the selection procedure is as complicated as that used by the vatican to choose a pope .
the range of names made public has been narrowed down over the past few months .
one of the top choices is rumored to be belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who has the backing of france and germany , the eu 's traditional powerbrokers . other matters up for discussion are the size and function of the european commission , as well as its powers to enforce the euro-zone 's budget rules .
talks also continue to be animated by the question of whether or not to mention europe 's christian heritage in the constitution 's preamble .
eight countries led by poland and italy want to have a reference to europe 's religious heritage in the preamble ; france and belgium are opposed to any reference . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing a new eu commission president eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .

instead of requiring the support of 50 percent of member states making up 60 percent of the population , the new draft sets the figures at 55 - 65 percent . in addition , the new draft proposes a minimum of six seats per country in the european parliament - a move aimed at reassuring smaller eu countries who fear their voice would be lost in the 732-seat assembly . presidential candidates another of the main issues for the summit to resolve is who will replace romano prodi as president of the european commission in november .
for many , the selection procedure is as complicated as that used by the vatican to choose a pope .
the range of names made public has been narrowed down over the past few months .
one of the top choices is rumored to be belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , who has the backing of france and germany , the eu 's traditional powerbrokers . other matters up for discussion are the size and function of the european commission , as well as its powers to enforce the euro-zone 's budget rules .
talks also continue to be animated by the question of whether or not to mention europe 's christian heritage in the constitution 's preamble .
eight countries led by poland and italy want to have a reference to europe 's religious heritage in the preamble ; france and belgium are opposed to any reference . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de choosing a new eu commission president eu countries and factions are lining up behind candidates they want to see head the eu commission , the eu executive in brussels .

according to a spokesman for the isaf peacekeepers , the car that was attacked had been clearly marked with the international group 's insignia and german flags . while no peacekeepers were injured , the incident has set off a flurry of criticism in germany from opposition politicians .
they are demanding a change in strategy and questioning whether the soldiers ' presence is enough to secure peace in the region , which until the past few weeks , had been counted among the country 's more stable areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian schmidt christian schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- , the defense policy spokesman for the conservative parliamentary group made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the attempt " to bring stability solely through the presence of uniformed soldiers " had failed . he called for stepping up intelligence-gathering to find out why attacks have begun to be directed at german soldiers .
he also demanded that the german parliament , the bundestag , should be the one to decide whether more german soldiers should be sent to the town of faizabad as another prt .
the government has not planned on seeking parliamentary approval for the deployment . according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , the dutch defense ministry has confirmed that a planned dutch-german prt for faizabad has been shelved .
the ministry said the dutch want to concentrate their efforts on other regions . the reconstruction team in kunduz comprises 200 german army soldiers , along with a small number of civilian assistants .

" difficult situation on the ground however , the head of the association of the federal armed forces , bernhard gertz , told the netzeitung internet news site that the concept of regional reconstruction teams should be reviewed to see whether it " offers the guarantee that orderly elections can be carried out in afghanistan . "
he warned about putting too pretty a face on the " rather critical " situation on the ground , in which the army can " no longer move freely around without armored vehicles . " afghanistan 's reconstruction minister , amin farhang , told germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung newspaper that more forces are needed on the ground right now in order to ensure that elections in the fall take place .
he wants to see the numbers of peacekeepers in the country increased from its present 6,400 to up to 10,000 .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

is it possible to work together after all ? not so long ago , the very idea of cooperation between the greens and the conservative parties would have been unthinkable .
but following a string of strong election gains by the greens , the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have begun to see the greens as a force to be reckoned with . leading cdu and csu politicians have said they plan to reconsider their strategy toward the greens following the summer break .
but whether the conservative 's new approach will involve courting the party of foreign minister joschka fischer as a potential coalition partner or fighting harder to stunt their growing popularity remains to be seen . " we have to come to grips with how we 're going to deal with the greens in the future , " said cdu parliamentarian volker kauder .
his primary concern , however , was not how to win the greens as a coalition partner .
instead , he said the cdu needs to think about how best to challenge the greens and analyze how the party appeals to growing numbers of voters , especially in large cities such as berlin and hamburg . gains for greens during last weekend 's elections for the european parliament , the greens managed to push its coalition partner in the federal government , chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , out of second place in several cities .
in berlin , for example , they had the second strongest showing after the cdu .
in freiburg - the only large german city with a green mayor - the greens captured the top spot . many of the cdu 's younger members have already grown accustomed to the idea of forming a coalition with the greens .
" it 's become a realistic option , " philipp missfelder , the head of the cdu 's youth branch , told the news agency dpa . given the slipping popularity of the spd , there 's a sense among some greens that the party needs to start looking ahead to the 2006 general elections if it wants to stay in government .
while there 's no doubt that having been the spd 's junior coalition partner since 1998 has helped the greens to mature as a party , analysts also say it was only due to the greens ' huge gains in the last general election that the spd even got a second term . " the greens have to look around for new coalition options for the long term , " dieter salomon , mayor of freiburg and greens member , told the berliner zeitung . inspiration to fight harder for some members of the cdu / csu , the success of the greens inspires thoughts of competition , not cooperation .
the cdu 's head in the state of north rhine-westphalia , jürgen rüttgers , said his party has to stop fighting for the votes of spd supporters and start fighting for those of greens supporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian socialist union -lrb- csu -rrb- party parliamentary floor leader michael glos one of the csu 's leading politicians , michael glos -lrb- photo -rrb- , said he sees opportunities for coalitions with the greens on a state level , but he drew the line at a coalition on a federal level , using a rather unflattering metaphor .
" in order for ticks to survive in the long term , they have to find a new host animal , " glos said .
" i do n't want us to become that new host animal .

-lrb- june 14 , 2004 -rrb- opinion : a crushing defeat sunday ’ s crushing defeat for the social democrats appears to spell the end for gerhard schröder ’ s government .
but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ? " the physical tests begin with apparently simple ball skills , such as keeping the ball in the air and touching it at least five times in a given time , and playing a number of " wall " passes within a set area .
it sounds easy but the first round of skills tests is harder than it sounds : eight out of ten players fail the first round . sensor monitoring tracks body movement the next phase concentrates on speed and physical strength where the cameras are employed to monitor a players movements and flexibility .
electronic sensors are attached to areas of the body and the data is fed into a computer .
the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .
the hope is that come 2010 , some of the players in the scheme will help germany win the world cup in south africa that year . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany surprises netherlands with draw the german-dutch classic did not disappoint on tuesday night , as the old rivals fought a spirited group d match ending in a 1-1 draw .

the scientists can then see how to improve the mobility of the player and what exercises should be introduced into his training to strengthen the necessary muscles . armin friedrich and his team of trainers take time to work with the players on a one-to-one basis and when the testing is over , the trainers keep an eye on their charges when they return to their clubs .
" as dfb trainers , we visit the clubs and organize further training with the local coaches based on the latest information gathered via practical experience and scientific research .
that way we have a very hands-on relationship with the clubs . " the test phase ends with a game .
the players are encouraged to dribble the ball when they want but the focus is on a passing game where the ball pings between the players with each touching the ball as little as possible while remaining in possession , creating chances and scoring goals .
all this is done on a specially designed pitch which is smaller than usual and which allows the players ' skills to be assessed at closer quarters . once all the results are in , the data is then assessed at the center in cologne .
the trainers will then take the results and continue to work with the selected players and their club coaches to improve their skills .

but on thursday , the social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- and their green party coalition partners managed to forge an agreement with the conservative opposition christian democrats .
german interior minister otto schily said the new law would help jumpstart the economy .
" the new law gives us the opportunity to take part in the race for the world ’ s best brains , " he said .
" self-employed foreigners now have the chance to settle here and foreign students can stay on after their studies .
i ’ m sure the new law will make a substantial contribution to germany ’ s economy . "
new workers allowed if passed , the law will allow the first major immigration of foreign workers into germany since the country closed its doors to turkish " guest workers " in the 1970s .
the agreement is set against a background of growing worries over the demographic implications of germany 's low birth rate and aging population , tempered by fears about a possible influx of radical islamic militants .
despite high unemployment figures near 10 percent , german business has long been demanding looser regulations that would allow more skilled workers to enter the country , arguing germany needs them to stay competitive .
deporting ' hate preachers ' however , the number of legal immigrants will remain limited .
the csu managed to keep its goal of limiting recruitment only in the case of highly qualified foreigners , such as engineers , computer specialists and scientists .
in addition , self-employed people who offer jobs to locals will also be allowed to immigrate .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , also known as caliph of cologne , during a rally in cologne , western germany .
the radical islamic theoligian wants to construct a worldwide islamic state under theologian leadership .
another key aspect of the deal is a rule that makes it easier for immigration officials to deport " hate preachers " - wording aimed at islamic extremists operating in germany - and to kick out terror suspects without trial .
the bill reflects pressure from the cdu for tighter security measures , prompted by the march 11 bombings in spain that killed nearly 200 people .
the alleged mastermind behind the attacks had previously spent time in germany .
only in may , the talks about the draft law were threatening to collapse when the greens threatened to abandon negotiations accusing the conservatives of making unreasonable demands about national security .
the sticking point was a cdu proposal aimed at provisionally detaining foreign extremists that can not be deported because they would face the death penalty in their home country .
although this has now been scrapped in the text , the cdu ’ s chief negotiator , peter müller , says the new law bears a strong conservative mark .
" the law is a dramatic improvement , " he said .
" it creates more security and provides better opportunities for the integration of foreigners .
we are now able to better channel and engineer immigration .
in addition german fulfills its obligations regarding humanitarian and asylum issues . "
the ultimate breakthrough came after schily agreed to spend up to € 100 million for integration courses for new migrants and the considerable number of foreigners already living here .
meanwhile , interior minister schily stressed that the greens - who had long objected to the proposals on civil rights grounds - would also agree to the final result .
the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , which was most vocal in its opposition to the original bill , is also expected to accept the compromise accord .
both sides said they were convinced the law would pass through the parliament 's mediation committee by the june 30 deadline , and would be approved by both the lower and upper houses of parliament on july 9 .
should they be approved , the regulations would go into effect at the start of 2005 . dw staff -lrb- jm / uh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : kaplan case casts doubt on immigration compromise the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .

by implementing the latest technology and scientific methodology , the german football association hopes to build a team of highly trained youngsters capable of competing for international honors in the future . regardless of whether germany succeeds in this year 's european championships , the future is already looking bright for the next generation of stars learning the skills that may see them emulate the likes of michael ballack and oliver kahn .
the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- is so focussed on the vision of future glories that they have introduced a revolutionary new method of talent spotting which embraces scientific technology to locate talented stars of the future as they evolve and then help develop their individual strengths . the dfb is collaborating with scientists from the german sports college in cologne on the pioneering project which monitors the soccer skills of promising young players aged between 11 and 16 who have yet to sign for a professional club . the project implements the use of cameras and scientific test methodology to assess and categorize skills such as dribbling , ball control and acceleration to create a personal achievement profile of each player which the scientists then file in a national database .
it is hoped that the data which is collected will help the dfb spot the next sebastian deisler wherever he - or indeed she - may be in germany and then tailor a specific training regime to the player 's own strengths and weaknesses . dfb scouts get computerized the research project was commissioned by the dfb in order to help scouts find the next generation of german players .
the scouts , more used to standing around rural pitches on rainy weekends while following up rumors of a rising star , are now being asked to expand their own skills by implementing the new technology into their jobs . the new approach to monitoring and training begins with a highly precise talent test which the potential young players have to take to advance further in the scheme .
armin friedrich , a trainer with the dfb , told dw-world why the talent test needs to be so precise . " precision is crucial because we need to compare 22,000 players from 387 dfb 's soccer bases .
if the test was any less accurate , it would be useless as a tool for scientific comparison . " specific training determines skill building once the players have been assessed , those chosen as the ones most likely to progress with the right training are introduced to the individual training programs specifically designed to their own needs and requirements by the scientists at the sports college .
stefan lottermann , one of the scientists who helped develop the technology , explained the questions the team must ask themselves before training can begin . " what indicators of talent are there in the different age categories ?
we have players aged between 11 and 16 in our various bases , so what we want to find out is : how should we be training an 11-year-old so that he has a chance of building a career as a top player in the first or second league ?

the lecs should also improve their checks on whether the benefits of the scheme were being delivered .
mr black 's report said that while the firms increased their workforces , results varied widely , with the cost per job up to 13 times higher in one area than in another .
and although the help was meant for viable firms and projects with a good chance of being self-sustaining within a few years , nearly two thirds of the firms had been supported by their lec for at least five years .
mr black said : " scottish enterprise accepts the needs for a more consistent approach to its account management services .

hyundai said it planned to spend $ 740m -lrb- £ 414m -rrb- in an effort to boost production at its chinese operation .
the move will increase hyundai 's output potential in china more than fourfold , to 600,000 vehicles a year by 2007 .
separately , hyundai 's kia subsidiary is to spend nearly $ 360m raising its chinese capacity to 430,000 cars a year , from 130,000 currently .
the investment programme will lift hyundai 's total output potential in china to more than 1 million vehicles a year .
supply boost both hyundai and kia 's chinese operations are run jointly with local manufacturers .
hyundai 's china expansion plans come hot on the heels of similar investments from a string of auto firms keen to boost their share of what is now the third biggest car market in the world .
altogether , foreign car makers have pledged to spend a total of $ 13bn by the end of the decade , an investment which will triple the country 's total car manufacturing capacity .
the flood of new investment comes despite fears that the supply of cars may soon outstrip demand .
the chinese government has warned that capacity could reach 14 million vehicles a year against demand of just 7 million by 2007 .
there are also fears that the economic boom which has fuelled demand for cars in china may be under threat .
the chinese authorities earlier this year warned that recent double-digit growth rates were unsustainable , and announced plans to take some of the heat out of the economy .
figures out earlier this week showed that chinese car sales fell by nearly 20 % in may compared with the previous month , with analysts attributing the decline to tighter credit terms imposed by lenders .

hyundai 's china expansion plans come hot on the heels of similar investments from a string of auto firms keen to boost their share of what is now the third biggest car market in the world .
altogether , foreign car makers have pledged to spend a total of $ 13bn by the end of the decade , an investment which will triple the country 's total car manufacturing capacity .
the flood of new investment comes despite fears that the supply of cars may soon outstrip demand .
the chinese government has warned that capacity could reach 14 million vehicles a year against demand of just 7 million by 2007 .
there are also fears that the economic boom which has fuelled demand for cars in china may be under threat .
the chinese authorities earlier this year warned that recent double-digit growth rates were unsustainable , and announced plans to take some of the heat out of the economy .
figures out earlier this week showed that chinese car sales fell by nearly 20 % in may compared with the previous month , with analysts attributing the decline to tighter credit terms imposed by lenders .

parliament would grind to a halt without them .
but what do they actually achieve ?
very little , according to labour peer and leading neurobiologist baroness susan greenfield .
she believes britain is becoming addicted to collective decision making - at the expense of individual responsibility .
social pressure she is calling for a halt to the growth of britain 's committee culture , before our institutions sink into paralysis .
" i think they -lrb- committees -rrb- should be kept to the minimum because they do waste people 's time .
i have been present for some very exciting , creative decisions in committees sir christopher frayling " you can sit there for hours listening to other people ventilating their views , trying to get a word in edgeways , when really you can be doing something much more productive , " she told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
above all else , she argues , the committee stifles originality .
" the problem with committees is that there is a consensus mood that operates .
" if someone wants to say something original or different or out of line , the social pressure not to do so is quite great . "
' exciting decisions ' chairman of the arts council and committee veteran , sir christopher frayling , also warns of the dangers of retreating into " committee land " .

the next best thing to do is to have a conclusion committee meeting , where everyone puts their views forward and then have a vote : simple but effective democracy , but obviously not that great for people who love the sound of their own voice or who have vested reasoning .
without structure , committee meetings tend to end up with people trying to speak , then not trying for fear of reprimand or self doubt and the only structure that then comes in is a political / hierarchical one ; and that itself is a restriction on expressing views and leads to intolerance and ignorance .

very little , according to labour peer and leading neurobiologist baroness susan greenfield .
she believes britain is becoming addicted to collective decision making - at the expense of individual responsibility .
social pressure she is calling for a halt to the growth of britain 's committee culture , before our institutions sink into paralysis .
" i think they -lrb- committees -rrb- should be kept to the minimum because they do waste people 's time .
i have been present for some very exciting , creative decisions in committees sir christopher frayling " you can sit there for hours listening to other people ventilating their views , trying to get a word in edgeways , when really you can be doing something much more productive , " she told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
above all else , she argues , the committee stifles originality .
" the problem with committees is that there is a consensus mood that operates .
" if someone wants to say something original or different or out of line , the social pressure not to do so is quite great . "
' exciting decisions ' chairman of the arts council and committee veteran , sir christopher frayling , also warns of the dangers of retreating into " committee land " .
but , he argues , there are certain decisions , on the distribution of government funds to the arts for example , which can not be made by an individual .
" i think committees can be extremely effective .
it depends on the mix , " he argues .
" i have been present for some very exciting , creative decisions in committees , which would not have been made - and could not have been made - by individuals . "

here are some of your comments : we the committee -lrb- undersigned -rrb- have collectively come to the conclusion that a collective decision-making process can be productive in some circumstances unless otherwise stated herein .
as composite 29 -lrb- b -rrb- clearly states , it is up to the committee members both individually and collectively to voice their opinions on matters , where they feel it appropriate , whilst excluding occasions where they feel that the majority view is to be otherwise ...
seriously though , they 're a waste of time .
run your committee like i do , on the blair cabinet model : make the decisions before the meeting , then use the meeting to allocate responsibility .
you can get them down to an hour tops .

we needed quick decisions and that worked well for us , although it was decidedly undemocratic .
ultimately a small committee with a respected and keen chair should be able to work just as well .
russ , london , uk as a member of a committee i agree whole heartedly !
the amount of time i have spent listening to others as the argue the point about the most insignificant of matters is depressing .
i would n't mind so much if we reached a decision but we rarely do , meaning the subject at hand ends up going round and round and ends up pushing our meetings late into the night and in most cases meaning we have to meet again to try and make a decision .
plus there is always the fear of not speaking your mind in case you hurt the feelings of another member .
