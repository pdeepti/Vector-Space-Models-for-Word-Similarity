the eu commission announced that all member states had named candidates .
speculation continues over who will get the most influential positions . now the hard work begins for josé manuel durão barroso , the head of the european commission .
in three weeks , he is expected to announce the final constitution of the eu 's executive body .
the rumors and wrangling over how he will fill the 24 positions started even before he was appointed to the office in july . barroso had little influence over the choice of appointees , which each country selected independently , but he had hoped that at least eight , or one-third , of the new commissioners would be women .
in the end , his pleas seem to have been heard : austria , denmark , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , sweden all nominated women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland nominated danuta hübner , who negotiated her country 's entry into the eu , for a position on the european commission .
while five of the appointees already served on the previous commission , the newcomers are no new kids on the block : nearly all of them have held high level political positions in their own countries .
seven former prime and foreign ministers - along with barroso , formerly portugal 's prime minister - will join the eu executive as well as a slew of past cabinet members .
several of the eastern european nominees have already become well acquainted with brussels as chief negotiators for their countries to join the eu .
not all the same barroso 's office has consistently denied all speculation about how he will fill the posts , and he will be at pains to stress that no position is more important than another .
he has already said he wo n't succumb to pressure from the large countries , such as germany , which has called for a big portfolio to reflect it 's influence in the bloc . areas like foreign , monetary and trade policy and competition are indeed influential - many argue the most important in the commission . larger eu members france , germany , italy , spain and britain are all vying for these posts after they relinquished one of their two commission positions to make way for the enlarged 25-member bloc .
therefore , barroso will likely try to appease them with high profile posts .
he will also have to create five new positions to bring the number of portfolios up to 25 . the portuguese politician is set to announce the results on august 27 .
the new commission will start its work on november 1 . the new european commission austria : benita ferrero waldner , currently foreign minister belgium : louis michel , currently foreign minister cyprus : markos kyprianou , former finance minister czech republic : vladimir spidla , outgoing prime minister denmark : mariann fischer boel , currently agriculture and fisheries minister estonia : siim kallas , former prime minister finland : olli rehn , former government economics advisor france : jacques barrot , currently eu regional policy commissioner germany : günter verheugen , currently eu enlargement commissioner greece : stavros dimas , currently eu employment commissioner hungary : laszlo kovacs , currently foreign minister ireland : charlie mccreevy , currently finance minister italy : rocco buttiglione , currently europe minister latvia : ingrida udre , currently speaker of parliament lithuania : dalia grybauskaite , former finance minister luxembourg : viviane reding , currently eu culture commissioner malta : joe borg , former foreign minister netherlands : neelie kroes , former transport minister poland : danuta hübner , former chief polish negotiator for enlargement portugal : eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso , former prime minister slovakia : jan figel , former chief slovak negotiator for enlargement slovenia : janez potocnik , former europe minister spain : joaquin almunia , currently eu monetary affairs commissioner sweden : margot wallström , currently eu environment commissioner united kingdom : peter mandelson , former trade minister dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slighted by eu commission president the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for .

this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 04.08.2004 it 's bundesliga time again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to the winner , the spoils the german bundesliga kicks off again on august 6 as it progresses further into its fifth decade in existence .
deutsche welle looks back at the ups and downs of germany ’ s professional league . in 1963 , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the german league stretches into its fifth decade , the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy with 41 years of glowing history to live up to .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga suffered a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire last year , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's dominance began in the late 60 's .
as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 41 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 18 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer collected a treasure chest of trophies in the 70 's .
the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the money-maker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
bayern reclaimed the championship in the 2002/03 campaign , romping home with the title after leading surprise challengers vfb stuttgart for most of the season .
however , the bavarian 's recapture of the champions shield was once again overshadowed by their ineptitude on the european scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen - bundesliga champions 2003/04 .
that stumble turned into a full blown slide last season when bayern crashed out of the european champions league at the first attempt and blew its chance to progress in the consolation uefa cup .
fcb then surrendered the league title to a barnstorming werder bremen team .
bremen won its 11th bundesliga championship and completed munich 's misery by completing a domestic double by also winning the german cup previously held by the bavarian giants . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga review 2003/04 dw-world tracked the ups and downs , ins and outs of last season 's bundesliga campaign .

global trade talks have been salvaged after a deal hammered out at the wto in geneva sees rich nations cut farm subsidies . global trade talks have been salvaged after a week of intense negotiations at the wto headquarters in geneva .
the doha development round collapsed last year when developing countries walked out of a key meeting in cancun , mexico .
under this latest deal wealthy nations have agreed to cut back on agricultural and export subsidies – a key demand made by developing countries .
in return , wealthy states have won greater access to the markets of poorer nations especially for industrialised goods and some services .
wto chief supachai panitchpakdi and the eu 's trade commissioner pascal lamy hailed the deal as a major breakthrough while ngo 's like oxfam complain that there are no firm committments or clear timetables for reform .
what is clear is that the 147 members of the wto are talking again and there 's hope that the doha development round will be completed by the end of 2005 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes wto deal farm subsidy deal eases wto fears commentary : doha 's last stand 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

deutsche welle looks back at the ups and downs of germany ’ s professional league . in 1963 , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the german league stretches into its fifth decade , the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy with 41 years of glowing history to live up to .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga suffered a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire last year , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's dominance began in the late 60 's .
as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 41 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 18 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer collected a treasure chest of trophies in the 70 's .
the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the money-maker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
bayern reclaimed the championship in the 2002/03 campaign , romping home with the title after leading surprise challengers vfb stuttgart for most of the season .
however , the bavarian 's recapture of the champions shield was once again overshadowed by their ineptitude on the european scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen - bundesliga champions 2003/04 .
that stumble turned into a full blown slide last season when bayern crashed out of the european champions league at the first attempt and blew its chance to progress in the consolation uefa cup .
fcb then surrendered the league title to a barnstorming werder bremen team .
bremen won its 11th bundesliga championship and completed munich 's misery by completing a domestic double by also winning the german cup previously held by the bavarian giants . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga review 2003/04 dw-world tracked the ups and downs , ins and outs of last season 's bundesliga campaign .

the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .

the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the money-maker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
bayern reclaimed the championship in the 2002/03 campaign , romping home with the title after leading surprise challengers vfb stuttgart for most of the season .

deutsche welle looks back at the ups and downs of germany ’ s professional league . in 1963 , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the german league stretches into its fifth decade , the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy with 41 years of glowing history to live up to .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga suffered a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire last year , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's dominance began in the late 60 's .
as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 41 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 18 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .

the gulf state will adapt the vehicles to the region 's desert climate before they will eventually be brought to iraq . germany is paying for the trucks and trainers , while the uae is covering travel and accommodation costs for the iraqi soldiers . " this agreement was possible because we have always stuck to a clear position , " thomas steg , the government 's deputy spokesperson , told the paper , adding that germany has always opposed us plans to send nato soldiers to iraq . during the alliance 's various negotiations , us officials had originally insisted that nato soldiers would come to iraq under american leadership .
france had rejected that idea , saying that such a step would drag nato members , who had opposed the invasion of iraq , into the conflict . germany has also offered to train iraqi soldiers in germany , but government officials in baghadad have so far not taken berlin up on the offer , steg said . earlier this year , experts from germany 's federal criminal police already trained about 230 iraqi police officers in the uae .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .

shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .

shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .

he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 04.08.2004 it 's bundesliga time again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to the winner , the spoils the german bundesliga kicks off again on august 6 as it progresses further into its fifth decade in existence .
deutsche welle looks back at the ups and downs of germany ’ s professional league . in 1963 , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the german league stretches into its fifth decade , the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy with 41 years of glowing history to live up to .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga suffered a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire last year , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's dominance began in the late 60 's .
as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 41 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 18 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer collected a treasure chest of trophies in the 70 's .
the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the money-maker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
bayern reclaimed the championship in the 2002/03 campaign , romping home with the title after leading surprise challengers vfb stuttgart for most of the season .
however , the bavarian 's recapture of the champions shield was once again overshadowed by their ineptitude on the european scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen - bundesliga champions 2003/04 .
that stumble turned into a full blown slide last season when bayern crashed out of the european champions league at the first attempt and blew its chance to progress in the consolation uefa cup .
fcb then surrendered the league title to a barnstorming werder bremen team .
bremen won its 11th bundesliga championship and completed munich 's misery by completing a domestic double by also winning the german cup previously held by the bavarian giants . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga review 2003/04 dw-world tracked the ups and downs , ins and outs of last season 's bundesliga campaign .

deutsche welle looks back at the ups and downs of germany ’ s professional league . in 1963 , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the german league stretches into its fifth decade , the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy with 41 years of glowing history to live up to .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga suffered a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire last year , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's dominance began in the late 60 's .
as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 41 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 18 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer collected a treasure chest of trophies in the 70 's .
the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the money-maker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
bayern reclaimed the championship in the 2002/03 campaign , romping home with the title after leading surprise challengers vfb stuttgart for most of the season .
however , the bavarian 's recapture of the champions shield was once again overshadowed by their ineptitude on the european scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen - bundesliga champions 2003/04 .
that stumble turned into a full blown slide last season when bayern crashed out of the european champions league at the first attempt and blew its chance to progress in the consolation uefa cup .
fcb then surrendered the league title to a barnstorming werder bremen team .
bremen won its 11th bundesliga championship and completed munich 's misery by completing a domestic double by also winning the german cup previously held by the bavarian giants . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga review 2003/04 dw-world tracked the ups and downs , ins and outs of last season 's bundesliga campaign .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets . " the declining -lrb- interest in stocks -rrb- is n't a surprise for us , " ulrich hocker , head of the german association for the protection of securities owners , said .
" it 's simply mirroring the ongoing uncertainty of private investors . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank public offering goes ahead in germany 's biggest public offering in four years , postbank is set to begin selling shares on the stock market with a slight delay wednesday after lowering the share price to respond to a lack of interest from buyers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.08.2004 speculation over travel giant tui 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo michael frenzel is fighting to protect tui from unknown forces rumors have abounded recently that europe 's largest tourism group could be subject to a hostile takeover .
this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .
the tui share price closed at € 14.43 on the german stock exchange tuesday , up 2.63 percent from the previous day . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tui enters russian travel market europe 's largest travel services company , germany 's tui , said monday it would enter the growing russian market .

" an arts commissioner must protect artists and their art , " he said .
" this commissioner must go . " festival officials had no objections even the organizers of the bayreuth festival appeared to distance themselves from the authorities ' decision . " we do n't want every artist using the festival as a backdrop for their performance art , " said spokesman peter emmerich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man sits next to one of the sculptures but höhrl 's installation was popular with visitors and the festival therefore had no objections , he said . the town authorities themselves were not immediately available to comment . it was not the first time that wagner 's dogs have hit the headlines . the plastic dogs are proving so popular that a large number of them have been stolen , causing the town police to issue a statement that the thieves , if caught , would be punished severely . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wagner festival starts without scandal the 2004 wagner festival opened with a controversial production of " parsifal " on sunday .

the eu commission announced that all member states had named candidates .
speculation continues over who will get the most influential positions . now the hard work begins for josé manuel durão barroso , the head of the european commission .
in three weeks , he is expected to announce the final constitution of the eu 's executive body .
the rumors and wrangling over how he will fill the 24 positions started even before he was appointed to the office in july . barroso had little influence over the choice of appointees , which each country selected independently , but he had hoped that at least eight , or one-third , of the new commissioners would be women .
in the end , his pleas seem to have been heard : austria , denmark , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , sweden all nominated women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland nominated danuta hübner , who negotiated her country 's entry into the eu , for a position on the european commission .
while five of the appointees already served on the previous commission , the newcomers are no new kids on the block : nearly all of them have held high level political positions in their own countries .
seven former prime and foreign ministers - along with barroso , formerly portugal 's prime minister - will join the eu executive as well as a slew of past cabinet members .
several of the eastern european nominees have already become well acquainted with brussels as chief negotiators for their countries to join the eu .
not all the same barroso 's office has consistently denied all speculation about how he will fill the posts , and he will be at pains to stress that no position is more important than another .
he has already said he wo n't succumb to pressure from the large countries , such as germany , which has called for a big portfolio to reflect it 's influence in the bloc . areas like foreign , monetary and trade policy and competition are indeed influential - many argue the most important in the commission . larger eu members france , germany , italy , spain and britain are all vying for these posts after they relinquished one of their two commission positions to make way for the enlarged 25-member bloc .
therefore , barroso will likely try to appease them with high profile posts .
he will also have to create five new positions to bring the number of portfolios up to 25 . the portuguese politician is set to announce the results on august 27 .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets . " the declining -lrb- interest in stocks -rrb- is n't a surprise for us , " ulrich hocker , head of the german association for the protection of securities owners , said .
" it 's simply mirroring the ongoing uncertainty of private investors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.08.2004 speculation over travel giant tui 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo michael frenzel is fighting to protect tui from unknown forces rumors have abounded recently that europe 's largest tourism group could be subject to a hostile takeover .
this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .
the tui share price closed at € 14.43 on the german stock exchange tuesday , up 2.63 percent from the previous day . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tui enters russian travel market europe 's largest travel services company , germany 's tui , said monday it would enter the growing russian market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.08.2004 speculation over travel giant tui 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo michael frenzel is fighting to protect tui from unknown forces rumors have abounded recently that europe 's largest tourism group could be subject to a hostile takeover .
this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .
the tui share price closed at € 14.43 on the german stock exchange tuesday , up 2.63 percent from the previous day . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tui enters russian travel market europe 's largest travel services company , germany 's tui , said monday it would enter the growing russian market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.08.2004 düsseldorf 's fashion star still glows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no sign of fading glamor here once germany 's undisputed hub of international fashion , düsseldorf faces stiff competition from new fashion capital berlin as it draws fairs and labels .
but experts are n't writing off the rhine metropolis just yet . until some years ago , düsseldorf was the place to head to for any seriously aspiring german fashion designer . with its slew of renowned international fashion trade fairs , catwalks populated by models clad in famous designs , swanky showrooms and high-end boutiques jostling for space on the elegant königsallee boulevard , the city on the rhine was the last word in fashion in germany . fashion fairs less popular but there are unmistakable signs that düsseldorf 's reputation as a fashion heavyweight comparable with cities like milan and paris is fading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermodel naomi campbell on the catwalk at düsseldorf 's königsallee over the last couple of days the city may have seen a flurry of glamour with supermodel naomi campbell sashaying down the catwalk during celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the königsallee and the twice-yearly " cpd woman-man " fashion trade fair , billed to be the world 's largest .
but even the international fashion trade fairs , the backbone of the city 's approximately 1,500 fashion-related businesses , are suffering from falling visitor and exhibitor numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model verena shows off a sleeveless summer dress at the cpd show in düsseldorf the cpd , düsseldorf 's most significant fair with a turnover last year of around € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.7 million -rrb- , registered around 48,000 visitors this year , a drop of 8 percent from last year .
the decrease marks a continuation of a steady decline over the past years . " what 's missing in düsseldorf is an overall concept of trade fair , city and economy , " alexander gerards , owner of the fashion company heidemann told daily rheinische post recently .
" the trade fair is purely an information platform today .
when the offer no longer suffices for domestic as well as foreign visitors and exhibitors , then the whole thing does n't make sense any more . " experts also trace düsseldorf 's fashion problems to the general sluggish consumer spending , rising insolvencies and falling profit margins plaguing the overall german fashion industry . a " dying reputation " a further problem ailing the crucial fashion trade fair industry in düsseldorf is the drain of famous labels like hugo boss and gerry weber , who prefer to set up shop in the numerous showrooms dotting the city rather than pay hefty prices to set up a stand at the cpd . last year the cpd fair was marked by wrangling between organizers and internationally-renowned german designer gerry weber , who for the first time refused to participate in the fair saying it was " too inflexible " and suffered from a " dying reputation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's famous shopping boulevard , the königsallee the move set off further alarms over the future of düsseldorf 's image as fashion hub and the economic significance of the city 's fashion industry , which is estimated to rake in around € 7.6 billion alone yearly for the state of north-rhine westphalia . competition from berlin but it 's not just the falling popularity of its trade fairs that is eroding düsseldorf 's chic image . few deny that the buzz in fashion circles in recent years revolves around berlin . the reunited , resurgent german capital , according to insiders , is pulsating with a raw creative energy that has sparked an exciting , young fashion scene . " you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , " 24-year-old andrea hartwig , who started the harbo and l ' wig clothes label two years ago , told dw-world .
" every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it 's contagious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model at the bread & butter fashion trade fair in berlin berlin 's growing reputation as germany 's new fashion capital has been further cemented with the recent arrival of two of the hottest fashion events in germany , the premium and bread & butter " street couture " fashion trade shows . the latter , which moved to berlin from cologne last year , has seen its turnover soar to around € 8.5 million this year from a mere € 250,000 when it first premiered in cologne . experts also point to berlin 's strategic location in a newly-expanded eu as a further factor in favor of the city 's fashion industry .
" ever since eu enlargement , the eastern european market is open to us , " karl-heinz müller , bread & butter creator said .
" ever since the borders are open , berlin lies at the center of europe . " düsseldorf more established despite the odds , few believe berlin can seriously edge out düsseldorf , which has a much more established image as a high fashion metropolis dating back to the economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s . experts point out that berlin 's current appeal to young and hip fashion fans may be all the rage but the capital can hardly compete with düsseldorf in terms of money and commercial clout .
figures suggest that berlin accounts for a mere ten percent of orders in the fashion industry compared to almost 90 percent in düsseldorf . " the fashion trade fair site on the rhine is better situated because of its proximity alone to important markets like amsterdam as well as its infrastructure , " karl schleicher , ceo of italian fashion label cinque told frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " all the right ingredients there " while industry insiders concede that düsseldorf lacks the history and myth that berlin is steeped in , it makes up for it with its internationalism .
the recently-concluded cpd boasted 1,800 exhibitors from 54 countries despite its diminished image . gerald böse , head of igedo , which runs the cpd fair in düsseldorf has already indicated that he plans to take steps to reverse the falling popularity of düsseldorf 's most important fair . " we 've been a closed shop until now .
we must open ourselves up , " he said countering criticism that the fair was too inflexible .
" after all , the city has all the right ingredients to make it a fashion nerve center to reckon with .

but experts are n't writing off the rhine metropolis just yet . until some years ago , düsseldorf was the place to head to for any seriously aspiring german fashion designer . with its slew of renowned international fashion trade fairs , catwalks populated by models clad in famous designs , swanky showrooms and high-end boutiques jostling for space on the elegant königsallee boulevard , the city on the rhine was the last word in fashion in germany . fashion fairs less popular but there are unmistakable signs that düsseldorf 's reputation as a fashion heavyweight comparable with cities like milan and paris is fading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermodel naomi campbell on the catwalk at düsseldorf 's königsallee over the last couple of days the city may have seen a flurry of glamour with supermodel naomi campbell sashaying down the catwalk during celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the königsallee and the twice-yearly " cpd woman-man " fashion trade fair , billed to be the world 's largest .
but even the international fashion trade fairs , the backbone of the city 's approximately 1,500 fashion-related businesses , are suffering from falling visitor and exhibitor numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model verena shows off a sleeveless summer dress at the cpd show in düsseldorf the cpd , düsseldorf 's most significant fair with a turnover last year of around € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.7 million -rrb- , registered around 48,000 visitors this year , a drop of 8 percent from last year .
the decrease marks a continuation of a steady decline over the past years . " what 's missing in düsseldorf is an overall concept of trade fair , city and economy , " alexander gerards , owner of the fashion company heidemann told daily rheinische post recently .
" the trade fair is purely an information platform today .
when the offer no longer suffices for domestic as well as foreign visitors and exhibitors , then the whole thing does n't make sense any more . " experts also trace düsseldorf 's fashion problems to the general sluggish consumer spending , rising insolvencies and falling profit margins plaguing the overall german fashion industry . a " dying reputation " a further problem ailing the crucial fashion trade fair industry in düsseldorf is the drain of famous labels like hugo boss and gerry weber , who prefer to set up shop in the numerous showrooms dotting the city rather than pay hefty prices to set up a stand at the cpd . last year the cpd fair was marked by wrangling between organizers and internationally-renowned german designer gerry weber , who for the first time refused to participate in the fair saying it was " too inflexible " and suffered from a " dying reputation .

shooting only black-and-white film , shunning artificial light and refusing to crop his pictures , he is seen by critics as one of the generation of photographers responsible for elevating what had been a hobby or a profession into a full-fledged art form . the " decisive moment " his personal contribution was to combine the notion of the " decisive moment " - the name he gave to a major collection of his work in 1952 - with the meticulous eye for design and proportion that he learned from his studies with painter andre lhote in the 1920s . the " decisive moment , " cartier-bresson said in an oft-quoted line , " is the simultaneous recognition , in a fraction of a second , of the significance of an event as well as the precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression . " a student of the surrealists , a movement at its height in the paris of the 1920s , cartier-bresson shared their view of the unpredictability of significance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at images , including " harlem , 1947 -lrb- easter sunday -rrb- " by cartier-bresson at the opening of a magnum photo agency exhibit in new york .
with the unobtrusive and fast-shooting cameras that became available from the 1930s , he was permanently on the look-out for arresting images , blazing the trail for generations of photojournalists to come . determined to " trap life " rebellious by nature , cartier-bresson left his studies in 1931 for colonial africa where he spent a year as a hunter and took his first photographs , few of which have survived . returning to france he came to realize the possibilities of the camera , acquired the leica which became his trademark and began - in his words - " prowling the streets ... determined to trap life , to preserve life in the act of living . " before the war he worked in eastern europe , spain and mexico and collaborated with the film director jean renoir .
imprisoned by the germans in 1940 , he escaped three years later and witnessed the liberation of paris and the return of prisoners-of-war . in 1947 he joined two colleagues at the newspaper ce soir , robert capa and david seymour , to found magnum photos , which for decades set the standard for photographic reportage around the world . cartier-bresson was on the scene at the start of communism in china and the murder of mahatma gandhi in india . among the famous names who have sat for him are jean-paul sartre , carson mccullers , barbara hepworth , henri matisse , edith piaf and the duke and duchess of windsor . he left magnum in 1966 to concentrate on portraiture , landscapes and drawing . famous images last year the henri cartier-bresson foundation was opened in the montparnasse district of paris , housing more than 1,000 original prints as well as contact sheets , films , manuscripts and correspondence .

shooting only black-and-white film , shunning artificial light and refusing to crop his pictures , he is seen by critics as one of the generation of photographers responsible for elevating what had been a hobby or a profession into a full-fledged art form . the " decisive moment " his personal contribution was to combine the notion of the " decisive moment " - the name he gave to a major collection of his work in 1952 - with the meticulous eye for design and proportion that he learned from his studies with painter andre lhote in the 1920s . the " decisive moment , " cartier-bresson said in an oft-quoted line , " is the simultaneous recognition , in a fraction of a second , of the significance of an event as well as the precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression .

" before the war he worked in eastern europe , spain and mexico and collaborated with the film director jean renoir .
imprisoned by the germans in 1940 , he escaped three years later and witnessed the liberation of paris and the return of prisoners-of-war . in 1947 he joined two colleagues at the newspaper ce soir , robert capa and david seymour , to found magnum photos , which for decades set the standard for photographic reportage around the world . cartier-bresson was on the scene at the start of communism in china and the murder of mahatma gandhi in india . among the famous names who have sat for him are jean-paul sartre , carson mccullers , barbara hepworth , henri matisse , edith piaf and the duke and duchess of windsor . he left magnum in 1966 to concentrate on portraiture , landscapes and drawing . famous images last year the henri cartier-bresson foundation was opened in the montparnasse district of paris , housing more than 1,000 original prints as well as contact sheets , films , manuscripts and correspondence .

the gulf state will adapt the vehicles to the region 's desert climate before they will eventually be brought to iraq . germany is paying for the trucks and trainers , while the uae is covering travel and accommodation costs for the iraqi soldiers . " this agreement was possible because we have always stuck to a clear position , " thomas steg , the government 's deputy spokesperson , told the paper , adding that germany has always opposed us plans to send nato soldiers to iraq . during the alliance 's various negotiations , us officials had originally insisted that nato soldiers would come to iraq under american leadership .
france had rejected that idea , saying that such a step would drag nato members , who had opposed the invasion of iraq , into the conflict . germany has also offered to train iraqi soldiers in germany , but government officials in baghadad have so far not taken berlin up on the offer , steg said . earlier this year , experts from germany 's federal criminal police already trained about 230 iraqi police officers in the uae .
that program is scheduled to continue in the fall . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .

france had rejected that idea , saying that such a step would drag nato members , who had opposed the invasion of iraq , into the conflict . germany has also offered to train iraqi soldiers in germany , but government officials in baghadad have so far not taken berlin up on the offer , steg said . earlier this year , experts from germany 's federal criminal police already trained about 230 iraqi police officers in the uae .

this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .

" it is very strange that , in the european union of the 21st century , one member state should be celebrating the military occupation of part of another member state , " he said .
london responded that it has a " good relationship " with madrid .
spain would like to restart negotiations over the british colony but london believes the people have made their views clear and is unwilling to go against the wishes of the population , 99 percent of whom said in an unofficial referendum they would rather remain under british rule .
the disagreement over the tiny territory has been a thorn in the side of uk-spanish relations since it was seized by the british in 1704 , and is a signal of a shift from the uk-spanish axis that emerged during jose maria aznar 's premiership .
current prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapetero has made it clear that he wants spain to move away from the uk .
" france and germany are the two decisive countries for the european construction and spain should be there , " he said .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets . " the declining -lrb- interest in stocks -rrb- is n't a surprise for us , " ulrich hocker , head of the german association for the protection of securities owners , said .
" it 's simply mirroring the ongoing uncertainty of private investors .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets . " the declining -lrb- interest in stocks -rrb- is n't a surprise for us , " ulrich hocker , head of the german association for the protection of securities owners , said .
" it 's simply mirroring the ongoing uncertainty of private investors .

a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets .

he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets . " the declining -lrb- interest in stocks -rrb- is n't a surprise for us , " ulrich hocker , head of the german association for the protection of securities owners , said .

this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .
the tui share price closed at € 14.43 on the german stock exchange tuesday , up 2.63 percent from the previous day . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tui enters russian travel market europe 's largest travel services company , germany 's tui , said monday it would enter the growing russian market .

german politicians back from a study trip to the democrats ' national convention in boston are ready to swap notes , hoping campaign enhancements will better their chances at regional polls in september . even to the untrained eye , the balloon-filled , song and dance , with the occasional prime-time speech thrown in , resembled more of a tightly scripted celebration than what most germans would call an election campaign .
but that did n't stop guido westerwelle , leader of germany 's opposition neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , from taking notes while in boston .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle , head of the fdp holds a bag with the slogan " more content " at the beginning of the fdp party in germany in may 2002 .
back in germany , the politician , whose party has made a name for itself through unorthodox campaign tactics , said the convention " was almost like a school lesson . "
spicing up a dull affair there certainly is a different feel on the floor of a us convention compared to the closed-in auditoriums packed with hardcore party members where germans hold their election conferences - events most voters experience for less than a minute during the nightly news .
although german parties try to inject some flair into campaigns by handing out clever giveaways like ice scrapers -lrb- " for a clear view , vote fdp " -rrb- and condoms -lrb- " a safe future with cdu " -rrb- , or by hiring media advisors to spice up their popular image with posters and commercials , they pale in comparison to their american counterparts when it comes to campaign rallies .
in germany these are more often than not drab affairs punctuated by lengthy party platform speeches in gray town squares .

the fact that us politicians do n't get bogged down in detailed discussions about the intricacies of a tax reform , for instance , is something the greens leader favors .

matthias machnig from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- told der spiegel that the key is " message control , " keeping a tight hold on the campaign and steering it the right way .
machnig was influential in helping to " amerikanize " the last two federal campaigns in 2002 and 1998 , which the spd won .
the american spin doctor dick morris , who managed bill clinton 's elections and has advised numerous politicians in europe , saw the situation a little differently back in 2002 , when the incumbent spd just squeezed past the conservative opposition christian democrats .
in an interview ahead of the federal elections in september of that year , morris told dw-world that german politicians did indeed need to learn from the americans , but that the lesson was not one of style , rather content .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former presidential advisor dick morris " the campaigns in the united states usually represent candidates with sharply different points of view , " morris said at the time .

german politicians back from a study trip to the democrats ' national convention in boston are ready to swap notes , hoping campaign enhancements will better their chances at regional polls in september . even to the untrained eye , the balloon-filled , song and dance , with the occasional prime-time speech thrown in , resembled more of a tightly scripted celebration than what most germans would call an election campaign .
but that did n't stop guido westerwelle , leader of germany 's opposition neo-liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , from taking notes while in boston .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle , head of the fdp holds a bag with the slogan " more content " at the beginning of the fdp party in germany in may 2002 .
back in germany , the politician , whose party has made a name for itself through unorthodox campaign tactics , said the convention " was almost like a school lesson . "
spicing up a dull affair there certainly is a different feel on the floor of a us convention compared to the closed-in auditoriums packed with hardcore party members where germans hold their election conferences - events most voters experience for less than a minute during the nightly news .
although german parties try to inject some flair into campaigns by handing out clever giveaways like ice scrapers -lrb- " for a clear view , vote fdp " -rrb- and condoms -lrb- " a safe future with cdu " -rrb- , or by hiring media advisors to spice up their popular image with posters and commercials , they pale in comparison to their american counterparts when it comes to campaign rallies .
in germany these are more often than not drab affairs punctuated by lengthy party platform speeches in gray town squares .

his own party , the junior partner in the german government 's coalition , has enjoyed a significant jump in popularity ratings recently , and bütikofer is eager to hold on to that edge in upcoming regional and state elections - four such are scheduled for september .
learning from america in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine earlier this week , he said attending the democratic convention opened up a whole field of questions a campaign manager could address in the upcoming months and years .

the eu commission announced that all member states had named candidates .
speculation continues over who will get the most influential positions . now the hard work begins for josé manuel durão barroso , the head of the european commission .
in three weeks , he is expected to announce the final constitution of the eu 's executive body .
the rumors and wrangling over how he will fill the 24 positions started even before he was appointed to the office in july . barroso had little influence over the choice of appointees , which each country selected independently , but he had hoped that at least eight , or one-third , of the new commissioners would be women .
in the end , his pleas seem to have been heard : austria , denmark , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , sweden all nominated women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland nominated danuta hübner , who negotiated her country 's entry into the eu , for a position on the european commission .
while five of the appointees already served on the previous commission , the newcomers are no new kids on the block : nearly all of them have held high level political positions in their own countries .
seven former prime and foreign ministers - along with barroso , formerly portugal 's prime minister - will join the eu executive as well as a slew of past cabinet members .
several of the eastern european nominees have already become well acquainted with brussels as chief negotiators for their countries to join the eu .
not all the same barroso 's office has consistently denied all speculation about how he will fill the posts , and he will be at pains to stress that no position is more important than another .
he has already said he wo n't succumb to pressure from the large countries , such as germany , which has called for a big portfolio to reflect it 's influence in the bloc . areas like foreign , monetary and trade policy and competition are indeed influential - many argue the most important in the commission . larger eu members france , germany , italy , spain and britain are all vying for these posts after they relinquished one of their two commission positions to make way for the enlarged 25-member bloc .
therefore , barroso will likely try to appease them with high profile posts .
he will also have to create five new positions to bring the number of portfolios up to 25 . the portuguese politician is set to announce the results on august 27 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.08.2004 new eu commission takes shape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu head barroso has a tough job ahead of him barroso 's team of eu executives is finally complete .
the eu commission announced that all member states had named candidates .
speculation continues over who will get the most influential positions . now the hard work begins for josé manuel durão barroso , the head of the european commission .
in three weeks , he is expected to announce the final constitution of the eu 's executive body .
the rumors and wrangling over how he will fill the 24 positions started even before he was appointed to the office in july . barroso had little influence over the choice of appointees , which each country selected independently , but he had hoped that at least eight , or one-third , of the new commissioners would be women .
in the end , his pleas seem to have been heard : austria , denmark , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , sweden all nominated women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland nominated danuta hübner , who negotiated her country 's entry into the eu , for a position on the european commission .
while five of the appointees already served on the previous commission , the newcomers are no new kids on the block : nearly all of them have held high level political positions in their own countries .
seven former prime and foreign ministers - along with barroso , formerly portugal 's prime minister - will join the eu executive as well as a slew of past cabinet members .
several of the eastern european nominees have already become well acquainted with brussels as chief negotiators for their countries to join the eu .
not all the same barroso 's office has consistently denied all speculation about how he will fill the posts , and he will be at pains to stress that no position is more important than another .
he has already said he wo n't succumb to pressure from the large countries , such as germany , which has called for a big portfolio to reflect it 's influence in the bloc . areas like foreign , monetary and trade policy and competition are indeed influential - many argue the most important in the commission . larger eu members france , germany , italy , spain and britain are all vying for these posts after they relinquished one of their two commission positions to make way for the enlarged 25-member bloc .
therefore , barroso will likely try to appease them with high profile posts .
he will also have to create five new positions to bring the number of portfolios up to 25 . the portuguese politician is set to announce the results on august 27 .

the rumors and wrangling over how he will fill the 24 positions started even before he was appointed to the office in july . barroso had little influence over the choice of appointees , which each country selected independently , but he had hoped that at least eight , or one-third , of the new commissioners would be women .
in the end , his pleas seem to have been heard : austria , denmark , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , sweden all nominated women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland nominated danuta hübner , who negotiated her country 's entry into the eu , for a position on the european commission .
while five of the appointees already served on the previous commission , the newcomers are no new kids on the block : nearly all of them have held high level political positions in their own countries .
seven former prime and foreign ministers - along with barroso , formerly portugal 's prime minister - will join the eu executive as well as a slew of past cabinet members .
several of the eastern european nominees have already become well acquainted with brussels as chief negotiators for their countries to join the eu .
not all the same barroso 's office has consistently denied all speculation about how he will fill the posts , and he will be at pains to stress that no position is more important than another .
he has already said he wo n't succumb to pressure from the large countries , such as germany , which has called for a big portfolio to reflect it 's influence in the bloc . areas like foreign , monetary and trade policy and competition are indeed influential - many argue the most important in the commission . larger eu members france , germany , italy , spain and britain are all vying for these posts after they relinquished one of their two commission positions to make way for the enlarged 25-member bloc .
therefore , barroso will likely try to appease them with high profile posts .
he will also have to create five new positions to bring the number of portfolios up to 25 . the portuguese politician is set to announce the results on august 27 .

but even the international fashion trade fairs , the backbone of the city 's approximately 1,500 fashion-related businesses , are suffering from falling visitor and exhibitor numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model verena shows off a sleeveless summer dress at the cpd show in düsseldorf the cpd , düsseldorf 's most significant fair with a turnover last year of around € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.7 million -rrb- , registered around 48,000 visitors this year , a drop of 8 percent from last year .

but experts are n't writing off the rhine metropolis just yet . until some years ago , düsseldorf was the place to head to for any seriously aspiring german fashion designer . with its slew of renowned international fashion trade fairs , catwalks populated by models clad in famous designs , swanky showrooms and high-end boutiques jostling for space on the elegant königsallee boulevard , the city on the rhine was the last word in fashion in germany . fashion fairs less popular but there are unmistakable signs that düsseldorf 's reputation as a fashion heavyweight comparable with cities like milan and paris is fading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermodel naomi campbell on the catwalk at düsseldorf 's königsallee over the last couple of days the city may have seen a flurry of glamour with supermodel naomi campbell sashaying down the catwalk during celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the königsallee and the twice-yearly " cpd woman-man " fashion trade fair , billed to be the world 's largest .
but even the international fashion trade fairs , the backbone of the city 's approximately 1,500 fashion-related businesses , are suffering from falling visitor and exhibitor numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model verena shows off a sleeveless summer dress at the cpd show in düsseldorf the cpd , düsseldorf 's most significant fair with a turnover last year of around € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.7 million -rrb- , registered around 48,000 visitors this year , a drop of 8 percent from last year .
the decrease marks a continuation of a steady decline over the past years . " what 's missing in düsseldorf is an overall concept of trade fair , city and economy , " alexander gerards , owner of the fashion company heidemann told daily rheinische post recently .
" the trade fair is purely an information platform today .
when the offer no longer suffices for domestic as well as foreign visitors and exhibitors , then the whole thing does n't make sense any more . " experts also trace düsseldorf 's fashion problems to the general sluggish consumer spending , rising insolvencies and falling profit margins plaguing the overall german fashion industry . a " dying reputation " a further problem ailing the crucial fashion trade fair industry in düsseldorf is the drain of famous labels like hugo boss and gerry weber , who prefer to set up shop in the numerous showrooms dotting the city rather than pay hefty prices to set up a stand at the cpd . last year the cpd fair was marked by wrangling between organizers and internationally-renowned german designer gerry weber , who for the first time refused to participate in the fair saying it was " too inflexible " and suffered from a " dying reputation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's famous shopping boulevard , the königsallee the move set off further alarms over the future of düsseldorf 's image as fashion hub and the economic significance of the city 's fashion industry , which is estimated to rake in around € 7.6 billion alone yearly for the state of north-rhine westphalia . competition from berlin but it 's not just the falling popularity of its trade fairs that is eroding düsseldorf 's chic image . few deny that the buzz in fashion circles in recent years revolves around berlin . the reunited , resurgent german capital , according to insiders , is pulsating with a raw creative energy that has sparked an exciting , young fashion scene . " you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , " 24-year-old andrea hartwig , who started the harbo and l ' wig clothes label two years ago , told dw-world .
" every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it 's contagious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model at the bread & butter fashion trade fair in berlin berlin 's growing reputation as germany 's new fashion capital has been further cemented with the recent arrival of two of the hottest fashion events in germany , the premium and bread & butter " street couture " fashion trade shows . the latter , which moved to berlin from cologne last year , has seen its turnover soar to around € 8.5 million this year from a mere € 250,000 when it first premiered in cologne . experts also point to berlin 's strategic location in a newly-expanded eu as a further factor in favor of the city 's fashion industry .
" ever since eu enlargement , the eastern european market is open to us , " karl-heinz müller , bread & butter creator said .
" ever since the borders are open , berlin lies at the center of europe . " düsseldorf more established despite the odds , few believe berlin can seriously edge out düsseldorf , which has a much more established image as a high fashion metropolis dating back to the economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s . experts point out that berlin 's current appeal to young and hip fashion fans may be all the rage but the capital can hardly compete with düsseldorf in terms of money and commercial clout .
figures suggest that berlin accounts for a mere ten percent of orders in the fashion industry compared to almost 90 percent in düsseldorf . " the fashion trade fair site on the rhine is better situated because of its proximity alone to important markets like amsterdam as well as its infrastructure , " karl schleicher , ceo of italian fashion label cinque told frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .

" it is very strange that , in the european union of the 21st century , one member state should be celebrating the military occupation of part of another member state , " he said .
london responded that it has a " good relationship " with madrid .
spain would like to restart negotiations over the british colony but london believes the people have made their views clear and is unwilling to go against the wishes of the population , 99 percent of whom said in an unofficial referendum they would rather remain under british rule .
the disagreement over the tiny territory has been a thorn in the side of uk-spanish relations since it was seized by the british in 1704 , and is a signal of a shift from the uk-spanish axis that emerged during jose maria aznar 's premiership .
current prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapetero has made it clear that he wants spain to move away from the uk .
" france and germany are the two decisive countries for the european construction and spain should be there , " he said .
-lrb- euobserver.com -rrb- dw-world.de gibraltar pledges allegiance to the crown nearly 99 percent of gibraltarians have said they did not want britain and spain to share sovereignty of their tiny territory .
the vast majority prefer uk rule .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.08.2004 speculation over travel giant tui 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo michael frenzel is fighting to protect tui from unknown forces rumors have abounded recently that europe 's largest tourism group could be subject to a hostile takeover .
this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .
the tui share price closed at € 14.43 on the german stock exchange tuesday , up 2.63 percent from the previous day . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tui enters russian travel market europe 's largest travel services company , germany 's tui , said monday it would enter the growing russian market .

deutsche welle looks back at the ups and downs of germany ’ s professional league . in 1963 , the german professional football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- re-launched its top flight national league as the bundesliga .
as the german league stretches into its fifth decade , the 18 teams of the modern era prepare once more to do battle over the championship trophy with 41 years of glowing history to live up to .
despite having a national league before the devastation of world war ii , germany only really got going in the professional stakes with the birth of the bundesliga in 1963 .
in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga suffered a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire last year , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .
taking inflation into consideration , clubs at the time were loath to spend more than a few thousand german marks on individual players .
eyebrows were raised when karlsruhe paid 100,000 marks for günther hermann in the 1966/67 season and jaws positively dropped when they repeated the fiscal feat by spending the same amount of money on hans georg lambert .
in the context of today ’ s game , these transfer fees spent to secure a quality player for a number of seasons would now pay for the skilful services of david beckham for about three days .
bayern launch era of dominance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's dominance began in the late 60 's .
as the bundesliga ’ s first decade came to a close , bayern munich ’ s ascent to the top of the german game began .
their first bundesliga title was secured in 1969 , some 37 years after they first won the german league in its pre-war form .
in its 41 year modern history , the bundesliga trophy has had the name of the bavarian giants etched on its silverware a further 18 times since that occasion .
the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .
enter ' der kaiser ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer collected a treasure chest of trophies in the 70 's .
the great bayern team of the 1970 ’ s also sported a young defensive midfielder by the name of franz beckenbauer .
as well as helping himself to all manner of domestic trophies alongside his munich team-mates , ‘ der kaiser ’ went on to be crowned european footballer of the year twice in 1972 and 1976 and become the youngest captain to hold aloft the world cup in 1974 .
the bundesliga entered its third decade ailing from a disease that would affect much of european football throughout the 1980 ’ s and , sadly , beyond .
german soccer hooligans and right-wing groups leeching off authentic fan bases regularly caused extensive trouble at bundesliga games and bitter rivalries such as that between neighbors borussia dortmund and schalke 04 often degenerated into violence .
it was a decade that saw drastic steps taken throughout the bundesliga to stamp out racist and nationalist elements accused of stirring up trouble .
with concerted efforts made by the clubs , the 1990 ’ s provided an almost clean book for the bundesliga – that would eventually help make it the money-maker it is today .
an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
bayern reclaimed the championship in the 2002/03 campaign , romping home with the title after leading surprise challengers vfb stuttgart for most of the season .
however , the bavarian 's recapture of the champions shield was once again overshadowed by their ineptitude on the european scene .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen - bundesliga champions 2003/04 .
that stumble turned into a full blown slide last season when bayern crashed out of the european champions league at the first attempt and blew its chance to progress in the consolation uefa cup .
fcb then surrendered the league title to a barnstorming werder bremen team .
bremen won its 11th bundesliga championship and completed munich 's misery by completing a domestic double by also winning the german cup previously held by the bavarian giants . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga review 2003/04 dw-world tracked the ups and downs , ins and outs of last season 's bundesliga campaign .

the 1970 ’ s saw bayern set new heights in the bundesliga under the watchful eye of legendary coach udo lattek .
throughout the decade of terrible perms , long locks and bushy beards , bayern won three titles back to back , beginning in 1972 , three european cups – following each of those championship wins - one german league cup and one world club championship trophy .
the decade also introduced truly world class stars ‘ der bomber ’ and ‘ der kaiser ’ to the world .
as well as being known as the ‘ der bomber ’ due to his devastating effect on opposition defenses , gerd müller was also called ‘ little fat ’ müller during his bayern days .
despite being diminutive in stature , müller broke record after record during his career , helping bayern to a yet unbeaten tally of 101 goals for and 38 against in the 1971/72 season , scoring 40 of his teams total himself .
he would eventually end his playing days as the bundesliga ’ s all time top scorer with 365 goals to his name .

in its early days , the bundesliga was almost unrecognizable from the mammoth business-orientated operation it is today .
as elsewhere , there were very few foreign stars , no one had even heard of outside promotional activities and there was considerably less money floating around in the game .
even though the bundesliga suffered a financial crisis due to the collapse of the kirch media empire last year , taking millions of euros with it in promised television revenue , the league is positively swimming in cash in comparison to its position in the late 1960 ’ s .

an attractive league with many of the negatives cleaned away from the german game , new interest in the bundesliga came with the introduction of top foreign stars which made for a more attractive , skilful and profitable game .
while the national team were cleaning up on the world stage , domestic german football was back on the map with 1996 bundesliga champions dortmund beating juventus turin to win the european cup in 1997 .
the turn of the century brought some of the most exciting finishes to the bundesliga in recent years with the 2000/01 two-horse title race between bayern munich and schalke 04 being decided by a patrick andersson 93rd minute free kick for the bavarian ’ s .
the following year also went to the very last day of the season with bayern , dortmund and bayer leverkusen all potential champions when the whistle blew for kick-off .
the top spot changed hands throughout the game as the goals flowed , but in the end dortmund ’ s last gasp 2-1 victory over werder bremen gave them their third bundesliga title .
bayern reclaimed the championship in the 2002/03 campaign , romping home with the title after leading surprise challengers vfb stuttgart for most of the season .
however , the bavarian 's recapture of the champions shield was once again overshadowed by their ineptitude on the european scene .

that stumble turned into a full blown slide last season when bayern crashed out of the european champions league at the first attempt and blew its chance to progress in the consolation uefa cup .
fcb then surrendered the league title to a barnstorming werder bremen team .
bremen won its 11th bundesliga championship and completed munich 's misery by completing a domestic double by also winning the german cup previously held by the bavarian giants . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga review 2003/04 dw-world tracked the ups and downs , ins and outs of last season 's bundesliga campaign .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets . " the declining -lrb- interest in stocks -rrb- is n't a surprise for us , " ulrich hocker , head of the german association for the protection of securities owners , said .
" it 's simply mirroring the ongoing uncertainty of private investors . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank public offering goes ahead in germany 's biggest public offering in four years , postbank is set to begin selling shares on the stock market with a slight delay wednesday after lowering the share price to respond to a lack of interest from buyers .
-lrb- june 20 , 2004 -rrb- postbank sticks with ipo , rules out sale to deutsche bank deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank .
-lrb- may 14 , 2004 -rrb- high expectations for public offerings after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon .

shooting only black-and-white film , shunning artificial light and refusing to crop his pictures , he is seen by critics as one of the generation of photographers responsible for elevating what had been a hobby or a profession into a full-fledged art form . the " decisive moment " his personal contribution was to combine the notion of the " decisive moment " - the name he gave to a major collection of his work in 1952 - with the meticulous eye for design and proportion that he learned from his studies with painter andre lhote in the 1920s . the " decisive moment , " cartier-bresson said in an oft-quoted line , " is the simultaneous recognition , in a fraction of a second , of the significance of an event as well as the precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression . " a student of the surrealists , a movement at its height in the paris of the 1920s , cartier-bresson shared their view of the unpredictability of significance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man looks at images , including " harlem , 1947 -lrb- easter sunday -rrb- " by cartier-bresson at the opening of a magnum photo agency exhibit in new york .
with the unobtrusive and fast-shooting cameras that became available from the 1930s , he was permanently on the look-out for arresting images , blazing the trail for generations of photojournalists to come . determined to " trap life " rebellious by nature , cartier-bresson left his studies in 1931 for colonial africa where he spent a year as a hunter and took his first photographs , few of which have survived . returning to france he came to realize the possibilities of the camera , acquired the leica which became his trademark and began - in his words - " prowling the streets ... determined to trap life , to preserve life in the act of living . " before the war he worked in eastern europe , spain and mexico and collaborated with the film director jean renoir .
imprisoned by the germans in 1940 , he escaped three years later and witnessed the liberation of paris and the return of prisoners-of-war . in 1947 he joined two colleagues at the newspaper ce soir , robert capa and david seymour , to found magnum photos , which for decades set the standard for photographic reportage around the world . cartier-bresson was on the scene at the start of communism in china and the murder of mahatma gandhi in india . among the famous names who have sat for him are jean-paul sartre , carson mccullers , barbara hepworth , henri matisse , edith piaf and the duke and duchess of windsor . he left magnum in 1966 to concentrate on portraiture , landscapes and drawing . famous images last year the henri cartier-bresson foundation was opened in the montparnasse district of paris , housing more than 1,000 original prints as well as contact sheets , films , manuscripts and correspondence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.08.2004 new eu commission takes shape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu head barroso has a tough job ahead of him barroso 's team of eu executives is finally complete .
the eu commission announced that all member states had named candidates .
speculation continues over who will get the most influential positions . now the hard work begins for josé manuel durão barroso , the head of the european commission .
in three weeks , he is expected to announce the final constitution of the eu 's executive body .
the rumors and wrangling over how he will fill the 24 positions started even before he was appointed to the office in july . barroso had little influence over the choice of appointees , which each country selected independently , but he had hoped that at least eight , or one-third , of the new commissioners would be women .
in the end , his pleas seem to have been heard : austria , denmark , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , sweden all nominated women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland nominated danuta hübner , who negotiated her country 's entry into the eu , for a position on the european commission .
while five of the appointees already served on the previous commission , the newcomers are no new kids on the block : nearly all of them have held high level political positions in their own countries .
seven former prime and foreign ministers - along with barroso , formerly portugal 's prime minister - will join the eu executive as well as a slew of past cabinet members .
several of the eastern european nominees have already become well acquainted with brussels as chief negotiators for their countries to join the eu .
not all the same barroso 's office has consistently denied all speculation about how he will fill the posts , and he will be at pains to stress that no position is more important than another .
he has already said he wo n't succumb to pressure from the large countries , such as germany , which has called for a big portfolio to reflect it 's influence in the bloc . areas like foreign , monetary and trade policy and competition are indeed influential - many argue the most important in the commission . larger eu members france , germany , italy , spain and britain are all vying for these posts after they relinquished one of their two commission positions to make way for the enlarged 25-member bloc .
therefore , barroso will likely try to appease them with high profile posts .
he will also have to create five new positions to bring the number of portfolios up to 25 . the portuguese politician is set to announce the results on august 27 .
the new commission will start its work on november 1 . the new european commission austria : benita ferrero waldner , currently foreign minister belgium : louis michel , currently foreign minister cyprus : markos kyprianou , former finance minister czech republic : vladimir spidla , outgoing prime minister denmark : mariann fischer boel , currently agriculture and fisheries minister estonia : siim kallas , former prime minister finland : olli rehn , former government economics advisor france : jacques barrot , currently eu regional policy commissioner germany : günter verheugen , currently eu enlargement commissioner greece : stavros dimas , currently eu employment commissioner hungary : laszlo kovacs , currently foreign minister ireland : charlie mccreevy , currently finance minister italy : rocco buttiglione , currently europe minister latvia : ingrida udre , currently speaker of parliament lithuania : dalia grybauskaite , former finance minister luxembourg : viviane reding , currently eu culture commissioner malta : joe borg , former foreign minister netherlands : neelie kroes , former transport minister poland : danuta hübner , former chief polish negotiator for enlargement portugal : eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso , former prime minister slovakia : jan figel , former chief slovak negotiator for enlargement slovenia : janez potocnik , former europe minister spain : joaquin almunia , currently eu monetary affairs commissioner sweden : margot wallström , currently eu environment commissioner united kingdom : peter mandelson , former trade minister dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slighted by eu commission president the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for .

the eu commission announced that all member states had named candidates .
speculation continues over who will get the most influential positions . now the hard work begins for josé manuel durão barroso , the head of the european commission .
in three weeks , he is expected to announce the final constitution of the eu 's executive body .
the rumors and wrangling over how he will fill the 24 positions started even before he was appointed to the office in july . barroso had little influence over the choice of appointees , which each country selected independently , but he had hoped that at least eight , or one-third , of the new commissioners would be women .
in the end , his pleas seem to have been heard : austria , denmark , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , sweden all nominated women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland nominated danuta hübner , who negotiated her country 's entry into the eu , for a position on the european commission .
while five of the appointees already served on the previous commission , the newcomers are no new kids on the block : nearly all of them have held high level political positions in their own countries .
seven former prime and foreign ministers - along with barroso , formerly portugal 's prime minister - will join the eu executive as well as a slew of past cabinet members .
several of the eastern european nominees have already become well acquainted with brussels as chief negotiators for their countries to join the eu .
not all the same barroso 's office has consistently denied all speculation about how he will fill the posts , and he will be at pains to stress that no position is more important than another .
he has already said he wo n't succumb to pressure from the large countries , such as germany , which has called for a big portfolio to reflect it 's influence in the bloc . areas like foreign , monetary and trade policy and competition are indeed influential - many argue the most important in the commission . larger eu members france , germany , italy , spain and britain are all vying for these posts after they relinquished one of their two commission positions to make way for the enlarged 25-member bloc .
therefore , barroso will likely try to appease them with high profile posts .
he will also have to create five new positions to bring the number of portfolios up to 25 . the portuguese politician is set to announce the results on august 27 .
the new commission will start its work on november 1 . the new european commission austria : benita ferrero waldner , currently foreign minister belgium : louis michel , currently foreign minister cyprus : markos kyprianou , former finance minister czech republic : vladimir spidla , outgoing prime minister denmark : mariann fischer boel , currently agriculture and fisheries minister estonia : siim kallas , former prime minister finland : olli rehn , former government economics advisor france : jacques barrot , currently eu regional policy commissioner germany : günter verheugen , currently eu enlargement commissioner greece : stavros dimas , currently eu employment commissioner hungary : laszlo kovacs , currently foreign minister ireland : charlie mccreevy , currently finance minister italy : rocco buttiglione , currently europe minister latvia : ingrida udre , currently speaker of parliament lithuania : dalia grybauskaite , former finance minister luxembourg : viviane reding , currently eu culture commissioner malta : joe borg , former foreign minister netherlands : neelie kroes , former transport minister poland : danuta hübner , former chief polish negotiator for enlargement portugal : eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso , former prime minister slovakia : jan figel , former chief slovak negotiator for enlargement slovenia : janez potocnik , former europe minister spain : joaquin almunia , currently eu monetary affairs commissioner sweden : margot wallström , currently eu environment commissioner united kingdom : peter mandelson , former trade minister dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slighted by eu commission president the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.08.2004 speculation over travel giant tui 's future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceo michael frenzel is fighting to protect tui from unknown forces rumors have abounded recently that europe 's largest tourism group could be subject to a hostile takeover .
this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .
the tui share price closed at € 14.43 on the german stock exchange tuesday , up 2.63 percent from the previous day . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tui enters russian travel market europe 's largest travel services company , germany 's tui , said monday it would enter the growing russian market .

this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .

" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.08.2004 german investors turn away from stocks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : why did n't i stick with bonds ?
according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets . " the declining -lrb- interest in stocks -rrb- is n't a surprise for us , " ulrich hocker , head of the german association for the protection of securities owners , said .
" it 's simply mirroring the ongoing uncertainty of private investors . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank public offering goes ahead in germany 's biggest public offering in four years , postbank is set to begin selling shares on the stock market with a slight delay wednesday after lowering the share price to respond to a lack of interest from buyers .

the gulf state will adapt the vehicles to the region 's desert climate before they will eventually be brought to iraq . germany is paying for the trucks and trainers , while the uae is covering travel and accommodation costs for the iraqi soldiers . " this agreement was possible because we have always stuck to a clear position , " thomas steg , the government 's deputy spokesperson , told the paper , adding that germany has always opposed us plans to send nato soldiers to iraq . during the alliance 's various negotiations , us officials had originally insisted that nato soldiers would come to iraq under american leadership .
france had rejected that idea , saying that such a step would drag nato members , who had opposed the invasion of iraq , into the conflict . germany has also offered to train iraqi soldiers in germany , but government officials in baghadad have so far not taken berlin up on the offer , steg said . earlier this year , experts from germany 's federal criminal police already trained about 230 iraqi police officers in the uae .
that program is scheduled to continue in the fall . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato summit bears fruit including sour grapes nato leaders in istanbul agreed to train iraqi security forces and increase the alliance 's presence in afghanistan on the first day of a two-day summit on monday .

this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "

publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .
damage control with all the rumors circulating , tui head michael frenzel has started engaging in damage control since initially responding that he " definitely " did n't know what the purpose was behind morgen stanley 's actions .
earlier in the week , he pledged to resist any attempt by hostile investors to take over or break up the group .
" i certainly wo n't stand by passively while asset strippers get into tui and break up the company , " he said in an interview with der spiegel newsmagazine , adding that he was taking preventive measures which he would not specify .
in response to the group 's currently volatile share price , a spokeswoman on tuesday announced that tui had decided to push ahead its report on second quarter earnings by a week to thursday .

this week , tui announced it would publish second quarter figures earlier than originally planned . speculation over the german company 's future has been rife since us investment bank morgan stanley announced in a newspaper advertisement that , since july 20 , it held 10.1 percent of tui 's shares .
industry analysts have been pondering morgen stanley 's intentions behind purchasing such a big share in an indebted german company .
observers say the us bank 's actions likely reflect one of two possible scenarios : either they 're holding on to the stocks to pass them on to others as with hedge funds that employ a so-called short sale strategy , or a takeover is in the works .
most tend to think morgan stanley is banking on hedge funds and plan to sell shares they have been lent by prime brokers , who then buy the stocks when the share price falls .
the broker then pays the hedge fund a commission that reflects the difference between the buying and selling price .
blaming hedge funds it would n't be the first time that hedge funds - which by nature keep their activities secret - had speculated with tui shares .
" tui is one of the best-known short stories on the market , " sy schlüter , manager of the hedge fund copernicus , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
schlüter acknowledged that his fund had made money on short sales of tui shares " because tui 's strategy does n't bear fruit and we considered the share overvalued . "
alternatively , some say morgen stanley may be acquiring the shares on behalf of a financial or strategic investor planning to take over tui .
publicly-owned german bank westlb is anxious to sell its 31 percent stake in the tourism group .
analyst viktor hund from germany 's bw bank told the dpa news agency a take over of tui was plausible .
" tui is certainly an interesting target , " he said .
the threat looms that tui could soon lose its place on the dax share index of germany 's 30 largest companies and that the initial public offering planned for the group 's lucrative logistics unit hapag-lloyd could be effected .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets . " the declining -lrb- interest in stocks -rrb- is n't a surprise for us , " ulrich hocker , head of the german association for the protection of securities owners , said .
" it 's simply mirroring the ongoing uncertainty of private investors . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank public offering goes ahead in germany 's biggest public offering in four years , postbank is set to begin selling shares on the stock market with a slight delay wednesday after lowering the share price to respond to a lack of interest from buyers .
-lrb- june 20 , 2004 -rrb- postbank sticks with ipo , rules out sale to deutsche bank deutsche post has said it will continue with its plans to float its retail banking arm postbank on the stock market next month , ending speculation the unit would instead be sold to deutsche bank .
-lrb- may 14 , 2004 -rrb- high expectations for public offerings after several difficult years , european market-watchers are hopeful that 2004 will be a turning point for ipos .
germany 's postbank is one of the biggest offerings on the horizon .

the eu commission announced that all member states had named candidates .
speculation continues over who will get the most influential positions . now the hard work begins for josé manuel durão barroso , the head of the european commission .
in three weeks , he is expected to announce the final constitution of the eu 's executive body .
the rumors and wrangling over how he will fill the 24 positions started even before he was appointed to the office in july . barroso had little influence over the choice of appointees , which each country selected independently , but he had hoped that at least eight , or one-third , of the new commissioners would be women .
in the end , his pleas seem to have been heard : austria , denmark , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , sweden all nominated women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland nominated danuta hübner , who negotiated her country 's entry into the eu , for a position on the european commission .
while five of the appointees already served on the previous commission , the newcomers are no new kids on the block : nearly all of them have held high level political positions in their own countries .
seven former prime and foreign ministers - along with barroso , formerly portugal 's prime minister - will join the eu executive as well as a slew of past cabinet members .
several of the eastern european nominees have already become well acquainted with brussels as chief negotiators for their countries to join the eu .
not all the same barroso 's office has consistently denied all speculation about how he will fill the posts , and he will be at pains to stress that no position is more important than another .
he has already said he wo n't succumb to pressure from the large countries , such as germany , which has called for a big portfolio to reflect it 's influence in the bloc . areas like foreign , monetary and trade policy and competition are indeed influential - many argue the most important in the commission . larger eu members france , germany , italy , spain and britain are all vying for these posts after they relinquished one of their two commission positions to make way for the enlarged 25-member bloc .
therefore , barroso will likely try to appease them with high profile posts .
he will also have to create five new positions to bring the number of portfolios up to 25 . the portuguese politician is set to announce the results on august 27 .
the new commission will start its work on november 1 . the new european commission austria : benita ferrero waldner , currently foreign minister belgium : louis michel , currently foreign minister cyprus : markos kyprianou , former finance minister czech republic : vladimir spidla , outgoing prime minister denmark : mariann fischer boel , currently agriculture and fisheries minister estonia : siim kallas , former prime minister finland : olli rehn , former government economics advisor france : jacques barrot , currently eu regional policy commissioner germany : günter verheugen , currently eu enlargement commissioner greece : stavros dimas , currently eu employment commissioner hungary : laszlo kovacs , currently foreign minister ireland : charlie mccreevy , currently finance minister italy : rocco buttiglione , currently europe minister latvia : ingrida udre , currently speaker of parliament lithuania : dalia grybauskaite , former finance minister luxembourg : viviane reding , currently eu culture commissioner malta : joe borg , former foreign minister netherlands : neelie kroes , former transport minister poland : danuta hübner , former chief polish negotiator for enlargement portugal : eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso , former prime minister slovakia : jan figel , former chief slovak negotiator for enlargement slovenia : janez potocnik , former europe minister spain : joaquin almunia , currently eu monetary affairs commissioner sweden : margot wallström , currently eu environment commissioner united kingdom : peter mandelson , former trade minister dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slighted by eu commission president the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for .

the eu commission announced that all member states had named candidates .
speculation continues over who will get the most influential positions . now the hard work begins for josé manuel durão barroso , the head of the european commission .
in three weeks , he is expected to announce the final constitution of the eu 's executive body .
the rumors and wrangling over how he will fill the 24 positions started even before he was appointed to the office in july . barroso had little influence over the choice of appointees , which each country selected independently , but he had hoped that at least eight , or one-third , of the new commissioners would be women .
in the end , his pleas seem to have been heard : austria , denmark , latvia , lithuania , luxembourg , netherlands , poland , sweden all nominated women .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland nominated danuta hübner , who negotiated her country 's entry into the eu , for a position on the european commission .
while five of the appointees already served on the previous commission , the newcomers are no new kids on the block : nearly all of them have held high level political positions in their own countries .
seven former prime and foreign ministers - along with barroso , formerly portugal 's prime minister - will join the eu executive as well as a slew of past cabinet members .
several of the eastern european nominees have already become well acquainted with brussels as chief negotiators for their countries to join the eu .
not all the same barroso 's office has consistently denied all speculation about how he will fill the posts , and he will be at pains to stress that no position is more important than another .
he has already said he wo n't succumb to pressure from the large countries , such as germany , which has called for a big portfolio to reflect it 's influence in the bloc . areas like foreign , monetary and trade policy and competition are indeed influential - many argue the most important in the commission . larger eu members france , germany , italy , spain and britain are all vying for these posts after they relinquished one of their two commission positions to make way for the enlarged 25-member bloc .
therefore , barroso will likely try to appease them with high profile posts .
he will also have to create five new positions to bring the number of portfolios up to 25 . the portuguese politician is set to announce the results on august 27 .
the new commission will start its work on november 1 . the new european commission austria : benita ferrero waldner , currently foreign minister belgium : louis michel , currently foreign minister cyprus : markos kyprianou , former finance minister czech republic : vladimir spidla , outgoing prime minister denmark : mariann fischer boel , currently agriculture and fisheries minister estonia : siim kallas , former prime minister finland : olli rehn , former government economics advisor france : jacques barrot , currently eu regional policy commissioner germany : günter verheugen , currently eu enlargement commissioner greece : stavros dimas , currently eu employment commissioner hungary : laszlo kovacs , currently foreign minister ireland : charlie mccreevy , currently finance minister italy : rocco buttiglione , currently europe minister latvia : ingrida udre , currently speaker of parliament lithuania : dalia grybauskaite , former finance minister luxembourg : viviane reding , currently eu culture commissioner malta : joe borg , former foreign minister netherlands : neelie kroes , former transport minister poland : danuta hübner , former chief polish negotiator for enlargement portugal : eu commission president josé manuel durão barroso , former prime minister slovakia : jan figel , former chief slovak negotiator for enlargement slovenia : janez potocnik , former europe minister spain : joaquin almunia , currently eu monetary affairs commissioner sweden : margot wallström , currently eu environment commissioner united kingdom : peter mandelson , former trade minister dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slighted by eu commission president the eu 's new commission president has offered the next german commissioner , günter verheugen , the industry portfolio - a position short of what berlin had hoped for .

but experts are n't writing off the rhine metropolis just yet . until some years ago , düsseldorf was the place to head to for any seriously aspiring german fashion designer . with its slew of renowned international fashion trade fairs , catwalks populated by models clad in famous designs , swanky showrooms and high-end boutiques jostling for space on the elegant königsallee boulevard , the city on the rhine was the last word in fashion in germany . fashion fairs less popular but there are unmistakable signs that düsseldorf 's reputation as a fashion heavyweight comparable with cities like milan and paris is fading . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supermodel naomi campbell on the catwalk at düsseldorf 's königsallee over the last couple of days the city may have seen a flurry of glamour with supermodel naomi campbell sashaying down the catwalk during celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the königsallee and the twice-yearly " cpd woman-man " fashion trade fair , billed to be the world 's largest .
but even the international fashion trade fairs , the backbone of the city 's approximately 1,500 fashion-related businesses , are suffering from falling visitor and exhibitor numbers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : model verena shows off a sleeveless summer dress at the cpd show in düsseldorf the cpd , düsseldorf 's most significant fair with a turnover last year of around € 30 million -lrb- $ 36.7 million -rrb- , registered around 48,000 visitors this year , a drop of 8 percent from last year .
the decrease marks a continuation of a steady decline over the past years . " what 's missing in düsseldorf is an overall concept of trade fair , city and economy , " alexander gerards , owner of the fashion company heidemann told daily rheinische post recently .
" the trade fair is purely an information platform today .
when the offer no longer suffices for domestic as well as foreign visitors and exhibitors , then the whole thing does n't make sense any more . " experts also trace düsseldorf 's fashion problems to the general sluggish consumer spending , rising insolvencies and falling profit margins plaguing the overall german fashion industry . a " dying reputation " a further problem ailing the crucial fashion trade fair industry in düsseldorf is the drain of famous labels like hugo boss and gerry weber , who prefer to set up shop in the numerous showrooms dotting the city rather than pay hefty prices to set up a stand at the cpd . last year the cpd fair was marked by wrangling between organizers and internationally-renowned german designer gerry weber , who for the first time refused to participate in the fair saying it was " too inflexible " and suffered from a " dying reputation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : düsseldorf 's famous shopping boulevard , the königsallee the move set off further alarms over the future of düsseldorf 's image as fashion hub and the economic significance of the city 's fashion industry , which is estimated to rake in around € 7.6 billion alone yearly for the state of north-rhine westphalia . competition from berlin but it 's not just the falling popularity of its trade fairs that is eroding düsseldorf 's chic image . few deny that the buzz in fashion circles in recent years revolves around berlin . the reunited , resurgent german capital , according to insiders , is pulsating with a raw creative energy that has sparked an exciting , young fashion scene . " you can do pretty much whatever you want , you can dare yourself here , " 24-year-old andrea hartwig , who started the harbo and l ' wig clothes label two years ago , told dw-world .
" every week a new bar or restaurant or label is founded here and it 's contagious . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model at the bread & butter fashion trade fair in berlin berlin 's growing reputation as germany 's new fashion capital has been further cemented with the recent arrival of two of the hottest fashion events in germany , the premium and bread & butter " street couture " fashion trade shows . the latter , which moved to berlin from cologne last year , has seen its turnover soar to around € 8.5 million this year from a mere € 250,000 when it first premiered in cologne . experts also point to berlin 's strategic location in a newly-expanded eu as a further factor in favor of the city 's fashion industry .
" ever since eu enlargement , the eastern european market is open to us , " karl-heinz müller , bread & butter creator said .
" ever since the borders are open , berlin lies at the center of europe . " düsseldorf more established despite the odds , few believe berlin can seriously edge out düsseldorf , which has a much more established image as a high fashion metropolis dating back to the economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s . experts point out that berlin 's current appeal to young and hip fashion fans may be all the rage but the capital can hardly compete with düsseldorf in terms of money and commercial clout .
figures suggest that berlin accounts for a mere ten percent of orders in the fashion industry compared to almost 90 percent in düsseldorf . " the fashion trade fair site on the rhine is better situated because of its proximity alone to important markets like amsterdam as well as its infrastructure , " karl schleicher , ceo of italian fashion label cinque told frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . " all the right ingredients there " while industry insiders concede that düsseldorf lacks the history and myth that berlin is steeped in , it makes up for it with its internationalism .
the recently-concluded cpd boasted 1,800 exhibitors from 54 countries despite its diminished image . gerald böse , head of igedo , which runs the cpd fair in düsseldorf has already indicated that he plans to take steps to reverse the falling popularity of düsseldorf 's most important fair .

according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ? germans , never particularly fond of equities , have apparently lost their desire to invest their hard-earned money on the stock market after experiencing the painful downturn of the past couple of years . the german equities institute -lrb- dai -rrb- , an independent association committed to promoting germany as an investment location , released a report last week showing the amount of people with stocks or mutual funds dropped almost five percent in the first half of 2004 from the last six months of 2003 .
a total of 540,000 germans decided to get out of the stock market , leaving the country with 10.6 million equities investors . only 16.4 percent of the entire german population now owns some form of equities , down considerably from the peak of 21 percent in early 2001 .
that pales in comparison to the united states , where around half of all americans have stocks or equity mutual funds . " compared to other industrial countries , the acceptance of stocks in germany is still unsatisfactory , " rüdiger von rosen , director of the dai , told reporters last week .
" many investors fail to completely take into account the long-term profitability of equities . " conservative germans german investors have long been more conservative than their american or british counterparts when it comes to stocks for a number of reasons .
chief among them is the fact that the german corporate world has traditionally relied on bank lending instead of the equity markets to raise cash . but things started to change in the late 1990s .
first came the initial public offering -lrb- ipo -rrb- of former telephone monopoly deutsche telekom in november 1996 .
billed as a volksaktie or " people 's stock , " the sale of telekom shares was considered by many to mark the start of a new german equity culture . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a trader at the frankfurt stock exchange grimaces as the german stock index , dax , falls more than 100 points in sept .
2002 .
shortly thereafter , germany got caught up in the internet stock craze that caused bourses around the world to surge to dizzying heights .
the lure of easy money encouraged more and more people to buy stocks and mutual funds , but the following crash and ensuing bear market has left many germans leery of further equity investments . and perhaps with good reason : after its ipo at dm28.50 -lrb- € 14.57 -rrb- per share , deutsche telekom 's stock soared to € 103.50 in only a few years .
but it plummeted just as quickly , and these days the stock is worth only € 13.80 . " stocks have a bad image - people prefer to invest their money in bonds or short-term money market investments , " dirk benninghoff , managing editor of the financial times deutschland 's finance and markets section , told dw-world . benninghoff said the debacle surrounding germany 's failed high-tech neuer markt stock market had left particularly deep scars on the average german investor , adding that the popularity of stocks had likely peaked in the years 1999 and 2000 .
he said as long as german shares continued to move sideways investor interest would stay limited . " the holding pattern on the bourses since the beginning of the year really does n't offer much of a chance to make profits , " benninghoff said .
" that 's also scaring people away . " hurting confidence corporate germany also has n't helped the situation . the ipo of postbank , the retail banking arm of germany 's logistical service deutsche post , was billed as another " volksaktie " earlier this year .
but the share sale became a comedy of errors after one of the lead investment banks for the ipo , deutsche bank , tried to buy postbank at the same time it was preparing it for the stock market . with a conflict of interest looming , deutsche bank eventually decided against buying postbank , but then one of its equity analysts came out and said the ipo was likely to be priced too high .
with several of the german finance world 's leading lights involved , it was not exactly an episode to inspire confidence in the equity markets . " the declining -lrb- interest in stocks -rrb- is n't a surprise for us , " ulrich hocker , head of the german association for the protection of securities owners , said .
" it 's simply mirroring the ongoing uncertainty of private investors . " marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de postbank public offering goes ahead in germany 's biggest public offering in four years , postbank is set to begin selling shares on the stock market with a slight delay wednesday after lowering the share price to respond to a lack of interest from buyers .

the dispersal order allows officers to break up groups of more than two people they perceive to be behaving in an anti-social way .
they can also take home under-16s out between the hours of 9pm and 6am .
the order , which runs for the next three months , has been made in response to the number of nuisance complaints made in newbold and the town centre .
the powers given under section 30 of the anti social behaviour act 2003 have been introduced in a partnership between chesterfield borough council and derbyshire police .
anyone who fails to disperse in the two areas can be arrested .
the maximum penalty is three months in prison or a fine of £ 2,500 .
section 30 orders are already being used by derbyshire police and its partners in buxton , derby and shirebrook to tackle anti-social behaviour .

the region 's main hospital last month came top of a league table of deaths from the superbug mrsa .
the office for national statistics said 22 patients died as a as a result of the so-called superbug in 2002 .
the hospital said that it was as a direct result of those figures that a task force was being set up to review hospital cleanliness .
patients said in a survey published on wednesday that most are happy with their care .
but the gmb union , which represents many staff at the hospital , has invited the health secretary john reid to discuss derriford 's cleaning standards which it says are not up to scratch .

teachers have given the idea a mixed reaction but martyn ware , the scottish qualifications authority 's computing business manager , says the thousands of pupils across scotland set to receive their results next week are likely to be among the last generation to sit traditional exams with pen and script .
" i think ultimately we could be looking back on the sort of exams and tests we use now and wondering how and why we ever ran such a system , " he predicted .
surely some mistake .
exams will not be the same if you do not sit at a desk in an examination hall , watching the clock and chewing on a pencil .

mr ware says a quick flexible system means children can reach their full potential , as they will not be harnessed to the learning pace of their classmates .

" we hope and we think that will give them the ability to demonstrate their maximum ability and to attain to the highest possible standard they can . "
dorothy graham , of st ninian 's high school in east renfrewshire , said there had been a mixed reaction from teachers .

the sqa says that online exam papers , currently limited to those normally marked by pupils ' own teachers , will be phased in over many years , running in tandem with traditional methods .
the sqa said there was much research to be done before open-ended answers could be marked using computers .
ronnie smith , general secretary of the educational institute of scotland -lrb- eis -rrb- , said implementation has to take time .

interim results from the trials suggest online testing makes little difference to candidates ' results .

the scheme is designed to cut the flood risk to around 57 houses in piddletrenthide in the piddle valley .
funding will come from the government and the environment agency , and the work was approved by west dorset district council on tuesday .
engineers will begin to construct the flood defences in september .
the area suffered badly in 2000 when 25 homes were flooded out .
' very pleased ' council leader robert gould said : " now the government funding has been confirmed , there is real urgency to get on with this scheme so property in piddletrenthide village will receive a reduced risk of flooding .
" anyone who has experienced the misery of having their homes , businesses and possessions spoilt by flood water will appreciate the value of this type of work .
