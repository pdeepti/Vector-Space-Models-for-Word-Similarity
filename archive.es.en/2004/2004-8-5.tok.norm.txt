" " the german side will not move as long as this court case is on the roll , " massing said late wednesday .
" it will not lead to any results .
while it is necessary to remember the past we should move forward together and find projects that will heal the wounds of the past . " some 200 ethnic herero filed a lawsuit in the us court of the district of columbia in september 2001 demanding $ 2 billion from the german government for atrocities committed under colonial rule . germany ruled namibia , then called german south west africa , between 1884 to 1915 before being forced to hand over the territory to south africa after its defeat in world war i. namibia won independence in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi , one of the herero chiefs involved in the uprising between 45,000 and 65,000 herero died after german officers issued an extermination order against the tribe in 1904 to crush an uprising against colonial rule .
referring to the methods employed to supress the rebels , general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
his policy was one of " blatent terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " the violent war against the tribe , which lasted until 1908 , is remembered by namibia 's 120,000 hereros as genocide . herero sue companies as well the lawsuit lodged by the herero peoples ' reparation corporation is also seeking $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation , formerly orenstein-koppel co . , and the shipping company deutsche afrika linie , formerly woermann linie , all of which allegedly profitted from german occupation of namibia . the district court of columbia was chosen to hear the case as it has a 215-year-old law on its books , the alien tort claims act of 1789 , that allows for such civil action from foreign countries . meanwhile , several herero representatives have reiterated calls for a formal apology from germany and negotiations on a settlement . " we want an apology and germany should start a serious dialogue with us , " said festus muinjo , one of the panelists examining the 1904 uprising .
" the herero issue will not stop , it will continue ad infinitum . " a reconciliation commission ? to break the deadlock , a german law professor has proposed the establishment of a reconciliation commission to deal with the issue .
" we should think of a reconciliation commission with leaders of the herero people and germany to work out an appropriate form of apology and possible reparation and hopefully an out of court settlement , " manfred hinz said .
political relations for its part , the german government acknowledges a " special responsibility " for namibia , according to a parliamentary resolution from 1989 .
since then , berlin has sought to promote intensive and productive relations despite the difficult past .
most visible of the cooperations is economic assistance .
germany is namibia 's largest donor country , and has provided aid for a number of development projects as well as culture programs . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering the herero rebellion namibia on sunday marked the 100th anniversary of the herero rebellion , remembering one of the darkest chapters of germany ’ s colonial past in what was once german southwest africa .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .

germany has some 270 soldiers in a reconstruction team in nearby kunduz , about 250 kilometers from feyzabad .
under a parliamentary mandate authorizing the deployment , it can send a total of 450 soldiers to the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2004 opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is losing confidence in iran iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .
europe would certainly be sticking to its promise to iran , which it also wants to gain as a partner in other areas .
nobody 's making it easy for the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany worried by iran 's nuclear activity foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity .
-lrb- july 29 , 2004 -rrb- iran agrees to inspections after eu talks the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2004 opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is losing confidence in iran iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .
europe would certainly be sticking to its promise to iran , which it also wants to gain as a partner in other areas .
nobody 's making it easy for the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany worried by iran 's nuclear activity foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity .

under a parliamentary mandate authorizing the deployment , it can send a total of 450 soldiers to the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2004 opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is losing confidence in iran iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .
europe would certainly be sticking to its promise to iran , which it also wants to gain as a partner in other areas .
nobody 's making it easy for the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany worried by iran 's nuclear activity foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity .
-lrb- july 29 , 2004 -rrb- iran agrees to inspections after eu talks the foreign ministers of europe 's big three - great britain , france and germany - breathed a sigh of relief when iranian officials agreed to nuclear inspections after a tense day of talks .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .

" " the german side will not move as long as this court case is on the roll , " massing said late wednesday .
" it will not lead to any results .
while it is necessary to remember the past we should move forward together and find projects that will heal the wounds of the past .

" we want an apology and germany should start a serious dialogue with us , " said festus muinjo , one of the panelists examining the 1904 uprising .
" the herero issue will not stop , it will continue ad infinitum . " a reconciliation commission ? to break the deadlock , a german law professor has proposed the establishment of a reconciliation commission to deal with the issue .
" we should think of a reconciliation commission with leaders of the herero people and germany to work out an appropriate form of apology and possible reparation and hopefully an out of court settlement , " manfred hinz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.08.2004 opinion : europe 's iranian dilemma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is losing confidence in iran iran said this week it did n't feel bound by promises brokered by germany , france and britain to control its nuclear program .
fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .
europe would certainly be sticking to its promise to iran , which it also wants to gain as a partner in other areas .
nobody 's making it easy for the europeans . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany worried by iran 's nuclear activity foreign minister joschka fischer has said he is concerned about tehran 's latest decision to go ahead with a threat to resume production of nuclear enrichment activity .

the spokesman said it was not yet clear whether other countries would also send backup forces to help the german team in feyzabad but said he was optimistic that current talks would " soon " produce results . nato agreed at its istanbul summit in july to step up troop levels in afghanistan ahead of the oct .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .
europe would certainly be sticking to its promise to iran , which it also wants to gain as a partner in other areas .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .

in addition , the spokesman confirmed that germany planned to send 80 soldiers as part of a civilian-military reconstruction team to feyzabad .
an advance team of 20 troops is already preparing for their arrival there in the middle of this month .
germany has some 270 soldiers in a reconstruction team in nearby kunduz , about 250 kilometers from feyzabad .
under a parliamentary mandate authorizing the deployment , it can send a total of 450 soldiers to the country .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .

" " the german side will not move as long as this court case is on the roll , " massing said late wednesday .
" it will not lead to any results .
while it is necessary to remember the past we should move forward together and find projects that will heal the wounds of the past . " some 200 ethnic herero filed a lawsuit in the us court of the district of columbia in september 2001 demanding $ 2 billion from the german government for atrocities committed under colonial rule . germany ruled namibia , then called german south west africa , between 1884 to 1915 before being forced to hand over the territory to south africa after its defeat in world war i. namibia won independence in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi , one of the herero chiefs involved in the uprising between 45,000 and 65,000 herero died after german officers issued an extermination order against the tribe in 1904 to crush an uprising against colonial rule .
referring to the methods employed to supress the rebels , general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
his policy was one of " blatent terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " the violent war against the tribe , which lasted until 1908 , is remembered by namibia 's 120,000 hereros as genocide . herero sue companies as well the lawsuit lodged by the herero peoples ' reparation corporation is also seeking $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation , formerly orenstein-koppel co . , and the shipping company deutsche afrika linie , formerly woermann linie , all of which allegedly profitted from german occupation of namibia . the district court of columbia was chosen to hear the case as it has a 215-year-old law on its books , the alien tort claims act of 1789 , that allows for such civil action from foreign countries . meanwhile , several herero representatives have reiterated calls for a formal apology from germany and negotiations on a settlement . " we want an apology and germany should start a serious dialogue with us , " said festus muinjo , one of the panelists examining the 1904 uprising .
" the herero issue will not stop , it will continue ad infinitum . " a reconciliation commission ? to break the deadlock , a german law professor has proposed the establishment of a reconciliation commission to deal with the issue .
" we should think of a reconciliation commission with leaders of the herero people and germany to work out an appropriate form of apology and possible reparation and hopefully an out of court settlement , " manfred hinz said .
political relations for its part , the german government acknowledges a " special responsibility " for namibia , according to a parliamentary resolution from 1989 .
since then , berlin has sought to promote intensive and productive relations despite the difficult past .
most visible of the cooperations is economic assistance .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .

at a meeting in geneva to discuss the issue , the wto upheld a complaint filed by brazil , australia and thailand finding the eu has broken trade rules by providing sugar export subsidies in excess of wto limits .
the european commission refused to comment on the substance of the decision , which is still confidential .
the wto 's ruling is likely to be upheld in its final decision .
this is brazil 's second triumph after the wto ruled in june that subsidies paid by the us to its cotton farmers were illegal .

" " the german side will not move as long as this court case is on the roll , " massing said late wednesday .
" it will not lead to any results .
while it is necessary to remember the past we should move forward together and find projects that will heal the wounds of the past . " some 200 ethnic herero filed a lawsuit in the us court of the district of columbia in september 2001 demanding $ 2 billion from the german government for atrocities committed under colonial rule . germany ruled namibia , then called german south west africa , between 1884 to 1915 before being forced to hand over the territory to south africa after its defeat in world war i. namibia won independence in 1990 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : henrik witboi , one of the herero chiefs involved in the uprising between 45,000 and 65,000 herero died after german officers issued an extermination order against the tribe in 1904 to crush an uprising against colonial rule .
referring to the methods employed to supress the rebels , general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
his policy was one of " blatent terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " the violent war against the tribe , which lasted until 1908 , is remembered by namibia 's 120,000 hereros as genocide . herero sue companies as well the lawsuit lodged by the herero peoples ' reparation corporation is also seeking $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation , formerly orenstein-koppel co . , and the shipping company deutsche afrika linie , formerly woermann linie , all of which allegedly profitted from german occupation of namibia . the district court of columbia was chosen to hear the case as it has a 215-year-old law on its books , the alien tort claims act of 1789 , that allows for such civil action from foreign countries . meanwhile , several herero representatives have reiterated calls for a formal apology from germany and negotiations on a settlement . " we want an apology and germany should start a serious dialogue with us , " said festus muinjo , one of the panelists examining the 1904 uprising .
" the herero issue will not stop , it will continue ad infinitum . " a reconciliation commission ? to break the deadlock , a german law professor has proposed the establishment of a reconciliation commission to deal with the issue .
" we should think of a reconciliation commission with leaders of the herero people and germany to work out an appropriate form of apology and possible reparation and hopefully an out of court settlement , " manfred hinz said .
political relations for its part , the german government acknowledges a " special responsibility " for namibia , according to a parliamentary resolution from 1989 .
since then , berlin has sought to promote intensive and productive relations despite the difficult past .
most visible of the cooperations is economic assistance .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .

fruitless talks in paris , at the same time , have left europe increasing frustrated . the foreign ministers of germany , france and britain avoided an escalation in the row over iran 's nuclear program by convincing tehran to sign a supplementary protocol of the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- late last year . then the iranians said they would allow the international atomic energy agency in vienna to carry out unlimited checks , and tehran would suspend all activities to enrich uranium . in return , the europeans promised not to bring the " case of iran " to the un security council , but to leave it with the iaea .
and they suggested that if iran continued to cooperate , they would provide the country with technical expertise for the peaceful use of nuclear power . nothing has come of it . even after the agreement was made , tehran concealed its activities to build centrifuges that could be used to make weapons-grade uranium .
tehran continues to insist it has no plans to enrich uranium - to complete the process of purifying the element for use as fuel for nulear power or weapons . but , in europe , mistrust and irritation have grown considerably since that announcement . still , the europeans have avoided drastic declarations or measures .
they want to wait until the iaea presents its next report , in september .
the europeans would only change course to the american position - to bring the case before the un security council - if the report does indeed turn out to be negative . washington is convinced that this will happen . aided by israeli claims , the united states has long accused iran of using its nuclear program to fashion itself into a regional nuclear power , rather than pursuing peaceful means , as tehran claims it is doing . washington is also the driving force behind the attempt to bring the issue before the security council , although , in view of developments in iraq , the americans ' " enthusiasm " has waned somewhat .
apparently , washington has abandoned the idea of " dealing with " iran - the second country in its " axis of exil " - next . in tehran , the issue was long ago declared a question of national honor - even more so since parliamentary elections in february strengthened the conservatives ' influence .
but the iranians have n't exactly demonstrated tactical skill : secretiveness and threats to revoke last year 's agreement only increase the europeans ' mistrust and the americans ' arguments . less could surely achieve more : the europeans have a strong interest in showing the united states that diplomacy accomplishes more than muscling .

ambitious youngsters , out to make a fast buck , hop skip and jump across business process outsourcing -lrb- bpo -rrb- companies , making staff turnover the single largest issue for business leaders and boardrooms .
turnover rates as high as 50 % have created a major problem for bpo companies as they compete with each other for a slice of the business cake .
and some have found a unique way to meet their growth numbers by turning to the " been-there-done-that 40 plus " generation .
the greying of the bpo sector began a few months ago and is a newly emerging trend in india .
as yet , most companies are wary of publicly calling for older people to fill vacant slots . "
i can do as well as people in their 20s and 30s " clemence d 'silva , 47 nor do they ask recruitment agencies to advertise for older people .

housewives , professionals who have taken early retirement and retired defence personnel are among those eyeing call centre jobs now .
clemence d 'silva , 47 , waits patiently in a queue for walk-in interviews at a call centre recruitment agency .
" i can do as well as people in their 20s and 30s , " he says , adding that the job offers " good money and good opportunity " .
many companies are now comfortable working with older people as they are seen as more responsible than youngsters , says one business leader .
looking beyond of the 425-odd bpo companies in india 's silicon valley , bangalore , more than half will expand their employee base by 20-40 % in the next 12-18 months .
the trend is towards hiring men who have opted for retrenchment schemes and are looking for jobs .
women looking for additional income and even housewives are now getting into the bpo and call centre fold .
raman roy , chairman and managing director of wipro spectramind , says some companies have started hiring older people to tackle the problem of losing staff .
but people in that age group are not easy to train and mould though they provide some stability to the company , he adds .
tva infotech ltd chief executive gautam sinha , a leading head-hunter in the it sector , agrees .
he says that companies have been forced to look at older people because they can not cope with high staff turnover .
moving on a major problem facing the industry is the limited career options it offers youngsters .

the toll rose by 10 pence to 30 pence in 2003 , but the bridge trustees say the new rise is necessary because of " unforeseen higher running costs " .
before the rise can be implemented for the 140-year-old bridge , the trustees must get the support of both bristol city and north somerset councils .
drivers will be able to opt to buy 1,000 crossings in advance at discount .
this latest increase has been prompted by a rise in overheads due to three main factors : - the vaults in 2002 a honeycomb of 23 vaulted chambers linked by shafts and tunnels was discovered within the stone supports of one of the towers of the bridge .
previously it was thought the 110 ft structure was solid .
insurance the cost of insuring the bridge doubled in 2003 and further increases are expected .
illuminations the lights on the bridge which first appeared in 1864 are due to be replaced .
the trustees say a six-figure sum must be found if new lights are to be in place for the bi-centenary of brunel 's birth in 2006 .
" it would be irresponsible to plan to run the bridge at a loss and spend our reserve funds , " said dayrell mcarthur , chairman of the trustees .
" the bridge is run by a charitable trust .
we receive no outside help towards our costs , either from central of local government or from lottery funds , therefore the bridge has to be paid for through tolls alone . "

audit scotland has found that nhs scotland is likely to meet the majority of targets on reducing waiting times .
the auditors also found that there was little explanation on how specific targets were achieved .
deputy health minister tom mccabe agreed that the nhs must improve the coverage and quality of management information on spending .
auditor general robert black said : " the nhs in scotland spends about £ 7bn each year and this is due to rise to £ 8.7bn by 2006 .
the public needs to know how well this money is used . "
' quality services ' scotland still suffers from high death rates in areas such as cancer , heart disease and strokes , in comparison with the rest of europe .
but while targets for reducing death rates from these big three killers are likely to be met , more needed to be done to cut coronary heart disease .
the report found increased funding and new ways of working were benefiting patients .
in particular , it found that medical advances were changing the treatments that patients received and more people could be treated in community settings rather than in hospital .
the health department wants ... to deliver high-quality services to patients , but it must identify what improvements it expects to see as a result of this investment robert black audit scotland headline figures in nhs spending in scotland rose from £ 6.1bn in 2001/02 to £ 7.2bn in 2003/4 and £ 8bn in 2004/5 .
however , much of the increase in funding will be taken up by cost pressures such as the uk-wide pay modernisation initiatives for consultants , gps and other nhs staff .
mr black added : " the health department wants pay modernisation to deliver high quality services to patients , but it must identify and measure what improvements it expects to see as a result of this investment . "
mr mccabe agreed health boards needed to give out more information .
he said : " we have made it clear to the nhs information and statistics division that they must further improve coverage and quality of management information . "
while mr mccabe welcomed the effects of modernisation and increase in funding highlighted in the report , he said more information would explain how new facilities and practices were affecting patients .
he said : " the report recognises significant changes in healthcare delivery , falling death rates for cancer and coronary heart disease and improvements in waiting times .
" but it also identifies a need for better information to monitor delivery of health care in order to quantify the benefits of higher spending and the increasingly rapid changes in clinical practice . "
nhs reforms can not be achieved without investment in the workforce dr bill o 'neill bma scotland tory health spokesman david davidson acknowledged " investment has been poured into the nhs " , but said waiting lists had continued to rise .
he said : " one of the major reasons why scotland 's waiting lists and waiting times have become a national scandal in recent years is precisely because the service , under this government , is not patient-centred but instead is controlled , directed and dictated by ministers . "
scottish national party health spokesman stewart stevenson said : " there clearly needs to be a further explanation about how targets that the executive has set will be achieved , otherwise it will be almost impossible to say for certain whether the overall performance of the health service has improved . "
dr bill o 'neill , scottish secretary of the bma , said the report had questioned the value for money provided by the new contractual agreements .
he said : " nhs reforms can not be achieved without investment in the workforce .
better care " it is no longer acceptable that doctors be expected to work extra hours for the nhs for free . "
he said improved terms and conditions would improve morale , which would in turn lead to better recruitment and retention of doctors and better care for patients .
and he agreed with the report that simply recruiting more doctors was not a solution .

audit scotland has found that nhs scotland is likely to meet the majority of targets on reducing waiting times .
the auditors also found that there was little explanation on how specific targets were achieved .
deputy health minister tom mccabe agreed that the nhs must improve the coverage and quality of management information on spending .

' quality services ' scotland still suffers from high death rates in areas such as cancer , heart disease and strokes , in comparison with the rest of europe .
but while targets for reducing death rates from these big three killers are likely to be met , more needed to be done to cut coronary heart disease .
the report found increased funding and new ways of working were benefiting patients .

mr black added : " the health department wants pay modernisation to deliver high quality services to patients , but it must identify and measure what improvements it expects to see as a result of this investment . "
mr mccabe agreed health boards needed to give out more information .
he said : " we have made it clear to the nhs information and statistics division that they must further improve coverage and quality of management information . "
while mr mccabe welcomed the effects of modernisation and increase in funding highlighted in the report , he said more information would explain how new facilities and practices were affecting patients .
he said : " the report recognises significant changes in healthcare delivery , falling death rates for cancer and coronary heart disease and improvements in waiting times .

scottish national party health spokesman stewart stevenson said : " there clearly needs to be a further explanation about how targets that the executive has set will be achieved , otherwise it will be almost impossible to say for certain whether the overall performance of the health service has improved .

the upgrade from " good " last december makes it one of only three out of 15 councils in the yorkshire and humber region to gain the top rating .
child care services and communications with local people came in for particular praise from inspectors .
the authority 's " clear plans " to improve housing and leisure facilities had also helped boost its rating .
the council has now set goals to further improve services by working with local people to decide what is special about the district and what kind of place they want it to become .
it is also aiming to tackle some of the more complex local issues arising from the area 's " urban and rural character " .
distinctive view frances done , managing director , local government , housing and criminal justice , said : " north lincolnshire has shown that it can not only maintain but improve on high quality services .
" the council is committed to continuous improvement by making provision for the future and getting to grips with some of its weaker service areas .
" it must step up its leadership to local communities and partners .
" it can do this by helping to shape a distinctive view of the area and agreeing what results it wants to see for the locality , for communities and for individuals and their families . "

buying back the 23.2 million shares and 5.6 million options - a process called " rescission " - would cost the company $ 25.9m , a tiny expense when set against cash reserves of more than half a billion dollars .

some of the 1,406 people whose shares and options are at issue may well decided to reject google 's offer , waiting instead to sell up on the open market .
indeed , one early investor with more than a million shares and one company official with about 50,000 shares have already said they will not take part , google said .
five-share minimum the high price for google shares in the flotation is the result of its decision to use a " dutch auction " process to allot shares to potential investors .
it was intended to put small investors on a more even footing with big institutional funds and influential investors , who have traditionally been given better access to newly-floated shares .
potential investors submit bids that include the price they are willing to pay and the number of shares - five at minimum - that they are willing to buy .
some critics , however , charge that the process has overvalued the shares , making them likely to fall in price once they hit the markets .

" they are not all bullies and thugs , they are young people and if you give them activities , then they will do them . "
he said a lot of resources were being spent on supporting young children and their families , but teenagers were missing out .
" the youth service is under-resourced and it is a huge issue that we are not facing up to , " he said .
" we have to look at the fact that we are a different society to 40 years ago .
" we have removed much of the community elements of society and we have to put them back in again . "
he added : " there are young people who want to take part , in youth parliaments and forums .

the bank said pre-tax profits for the six months to june rose 23 % on the year to £ 2.4bn , ahead of city forecasts of about £ 2.2bn.
barclays ' investment banking arm , buoyed by a financial market upturn , accounted for the bulk of the increase .
chief executive matt barrett said the bank had enjoyed a ' record ' half-year .
he added that barclays looked set to benefit from an improving economic climate in the months ahead .
confidence " the economic outlook for the remainder of the year looks healthy , " he said .
" it is an encouraging environment for barclays clients and customers . "
city investors welcomed the figures , marking barclays shares 2.2 % higher to 480.5p by mid-morning on thursday .
deputy chief john varley said barclays was keen to expand its business , but would not comment on whether it was considering a bid for british mortgage lender abbey national .
abbey last month accepted a takeover offer from spanish banking group santander central hispano , prompting speculation that rival offers could emerge .
barclays sought to dispel fears that investment banking revenues could fall off in the months ahead , saying growth in the second half had been driven by repeat business from existing clients rather than volatile securities trading .
the bank added that costs rose 15 % to £ 3.9bn , lifted by a programme of investment in its branch network .
bad debt provisions were down 10 % at £ 589m .

the bank said pre-tax profits for the six months to june rose 23 % on the year to £ 2.4bn , ahead of city forecasts of about £ 2.2bn.
barclays ' investment banking arm , buoyed by a financial market upturn , accounted for the bulk of the increase .
chief executive matt barrett said the bank had enjoyed a ' record ' half-year .
he added that barclays looked set to benefit from an improving economic climate in the months ahead .
confidence " the economic outlook for the remainder of the year looks healthy , " he said .
" it is an encouraging environment for barclays clients and customers . "
city investors welcomed the figures , marking barclays shares 2.2 % higher to 480.5p by mid-morning on thursday .
deputy chief john varley said barclays was keen to expand its business , but would not comment on whether it was considering a bid for british mortgage lender abbey national .
abbey last month accepted a takeover offer from spanish banking group santander central hispano , prompting speculation that rival offers could emerge .
barclays sought to dispel fears that investment banking revenues could fall off in the months ahead , saying growth in the second half had been driven by repeat business from existing clients rather than volatile securities trading .
the bank added that costs rose 15 % to £ 3.9bn , lifted by a programme of investment in its branch network .

the caerphilly study was launched in 1979 to help understand the causes of heart disease .
since then , men have taken part in research which has made medical breakthroughs - like taking aspirin for preventing heart attacks .
they and their families have marked the study 's success at a celebration .
caerphilly was originally chosen as the centre for the study because the south wales valleys were then a black spot for problems of heart disease , explained professor peter elwood , from the university of wales college of medicine .
prof elwood has led the study , which started by concentrating on researching the causes of heart disease .
but as the volunteers have grown older , it has concentrated more on dementia and the effect of strokes or mini-strokes .
i have been very fortunate to take part in the study .
it has been a privilege john parry two hundred papers detailing the study 's research have been written and its contribution to medicine has been " immense " , he said .
twelve hundred of the original 2800 men aged between 25 and 49 who volunteered for the study have just completed the fifth element .
another component of the study is now planned for 2009 .
" the caerphilly study has made a particular contribution in looking at blood clotting and thrombosis and their relation to heart attacks and strokes , " said professor elwood .
" as the men have grown older we have turned to look at strokes and sadly , dementia .
" we know that alzheimer 's disease is a cause of dementia but strokes and mini strokes are even more important , " he said .
while the study has been going understanding of heart disease has improved across the uk and western europe as a whole , and professor elwood said the caerphilly study had contributed significantly to the body of knowledge .
attempting to set up a similar study today would be " difficult " , he said , both because of restraints imposed by the ethics committee and because of its size .
volunteer john parry says it has been a privilege to take part grandfather-of-five john parry was 49 when he signed up for the study and he says it has benefited him as he has grown older .
" i do tend to look after my health .
i do n't smoke and i do n't indulge too much in alcohol - although i do have a drink now and then .
" i have been very fortunate to take part in the study .
it has been a privilege , " said the 74-year-old .
on thursday health minister jane hutt and mp wayne david joined researchers , the caerphilly men and their wives at the town 's rugby club for a ' thank you ' party .
" 2,800 men started the study and many of them are still co-operating .
they have contributed enormously to scientific research .
this is a celebration and our way of sharing our thanks , " said professor elwood .
