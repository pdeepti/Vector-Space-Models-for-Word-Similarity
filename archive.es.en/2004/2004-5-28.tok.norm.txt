in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .

malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .

germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .

beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .

austrian president thomas klestil said that " all european countries should find a place at the heart of the union , as soon as they fulfill the adhesion criteria . "
the presidents of romania and bulgaria repeated their wish to conclude negotiations with the eu by the end of the year , so as to join the union in 2007 .
some of the countries represented at the summit are already eu members -lrb- austria , germany , hungary , poland , czech republic , slovakia and slovenia -rrb- .
others -lrb- bulgaria , romania , croatia , serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania , moldova and ukraine -rrb- are eu hopefuls .
the four western balkan countries -lrb- serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania -rrb- are hoping to join the eu between 2010 and 2015 .
moldova and ukraine have expressed a desire to join the union but enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has said that their accession is " not on the commission 's agenda . "
on friday the presidents will discuss the stability of the balkan region and how to get more investment in the region .
the mamaia summit is the 11th such gathering since germany , austria , hungary and the czech republic agreed in 1993 to launch a debate on closer ties between the european union and former eastern bloc countries .

the presidents of romania and bulgaria repeated their wish to conclude negotiations with the eu by the end of the year , so as to join the union in 2007 .

others -lrb- bulgaria , romania , croatia , serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania , moldova and ukraine -rrb- are eu hopefuls .

on friday the presidents will discuss the stability of the balkan region and how to get more investment in the region .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .
at least half a million people are expected to travel to portugal for euro 2004 , in addition to the usual 1.4 million tourists who visit the country each june .
earlier in may , the u.s. state department warned its citizens about the possibility of terrorist attacks and hooliganism at euro 2004 .
the state department later added that the warning was not in response to any intelligence that suggested a strike was imminent at the 16-nation tournament , one of the world 's largest sporting events . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live typisch deutsch - leben in deutschland we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.05.2004 germany thrashes malta 's part-timers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking a lot happier than in romania last month the german national soccer team went some way to repairing its damaged reputation on thursday by beating malta 7-0 in a friendly match as part of its euro 2004 preparations . in a recent television interview , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned germany 's european soccer rivals that the national team should not be underestimated going into the euro 2004 tournament in portugal in june .
in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .

freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.05.2004 germany thrashes malta 's part-timers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking a lot happier than in romania last month the german national soccer team went some way to repairing its damaged reputation on thursday by beating malta 7-0 in a friendly match as part of its euro 2004 preparations . in a recent television interview , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned germany 's european soccer rivals that the national team should not be underestimated going into the euro 2004 tournament in portugal in june .
in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.05.2004 germany thrashes malta 's part-timers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking a lot happier than in romania last month the german national soccer team went some way to repairing its damaged reputation on thursday by beating malta 7-0 in a friendly match as part of its euro 2004 preparations . in a recent television interview , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned germany 's european soccer rivals that the national team should not be underestimated going into the euro 2004 tournament in portugal in june .
in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .
in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german soccer humiliated in bucharest it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .
at least half a million people are expected to travel to portugal for euro 2004 , in addition to the usual 1.4 million tourists who visit the country each june .
earlier in may , the u.s. state department warned its citizens about the possibility of terrorist attacks and hooliganism at euro 2004 .
the state department later added that the warning was not in response to any intelligence that suggested a strike was imminent at the 16-nation tournament , one of the world 's largest sporting events . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live tomorrow today we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .
at least half a million people are expected to travel to portugal for euro 2004 , in addition to the usual 1.4 million tourists who visit the country each june .
earlier in may , the u.s. state department warned its citizens about the possibility of terrorist attacks and hooliganism at euro 2004 .
the state department later added that the warning was not in response to any intelligence that suggested a strike was imminent at the 16-nation tournament , one of the world 's largest sporting events . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .

the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country . as teams and supporters alike count the days to the european soccer championships in portugal in june , security forces across europe are doing the same but for very different reasons .
while the summer spectacle promises to be full of soccer drama , heartbreak and ecstasy , the threat looms that bringing the notorious supporters of some of europe 's most trouble-prone nations together again will erupt in violence .
at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .
german suspects forbidden to leave home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the relative successes of their border control operations at the last european championships , german police have already announced that some 4,500 reputed football hooligans will be prevented from travelling to portugal this summer .
however , despite german efforts at the last championships , hooligans escaped the " stop and search " initiative of 2000 in enough numbers to face off against their english rivals in belgium .
during the 1998 world cup in france , a group of german hooligans beat daniel nivel with a metal rod and a wooden board , leaving the french police officer in a coma for six weeks .
police expect a large violent presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german police are under no illusions about the task at hand .
" we expect hooligans to be there in big numbers .
there 's considerable interest in the scene in the european championship , " said michael endler , head of the düsseldorf-based zis , the police department that handles hooligans , in an interview with der spiegel magazine earlier this year . in addition to suspending travel privileges for known trouble-makers , the zis will send a special unit of officers " knowledgeable about the scene " to travel with suspected german hooligans in an attempt to prevent violence during the soccer event , which runs until july 4 . according to der spiegel , germany 's police fear the proximity of portugal will encourage german hooligans to travel to the event via less secure routes such as by road , since airports , ports and railways stations will be home to designated undercover " spotters " ready to swoop on and deport anyone known to have a history of soccer violence . germany and britain pledge support german interior minister otto schily , responsible for the country 's sports , has promised the host nation that it would have germany 's full support against violence during euro 2004 in portugal . this move was mirrored by british home office minister hazel blears , who also recently assured the portuguese government that britain was doing all it could to keep england soccer hooligans away from euro 2004 . the british have already agreed to prevent around 2,500 hooligans from travelling to the three-week event by seizing their passports . massive operation underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and british police will be among at least 118 foreign officers working alongside their portuguese colleagues in one of the most expensive and widespread crackdowns on football hooligans in the history of the game and the biggest security operation ever staged in portugal . besides the 50,000 police in portugal , made up of the gendarmerie and state police , the portuguese government has spent some € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- on new police equipment , which includes more than 150 new police cars and the country 's first water cannon vehicles , as well as truncheons , riot gear , pepper spray and police dogs .
organizers have already switched the venues for two first-phase matches , involving germany , england and the netherlands , to bigger cities where policing of troublemakers would be easier .
officers to take tough action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general leonel carvalho , who heads the police security at the championship , said that his policy is one of gradually increasing response .

“ we do not have the power to intervene to prevent anything happening .
we can only act afterwards .
if we arrest someone , we have to justify it . ”
the city of lisbon , which will host games in the opening group stage involving germany and the netherlands , has cancelled all police holiday leave during the finals and has pledged to hire another 2,000 officers to beef up security .
a squad of 2,000 officers has been given extra training for the tournament .
they will be armed , have truncheons and be able to use dogs and pepper gas to control unruly fans .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .
at least half a million people are expected to travel to portugal for euro 2004 , in addition to the usual 1.4 million tourists who visit the country each june .
earlier in may , the u.s. state department warned its citizens about the possibility of terrorist attacks and hooliganism at euro 2004 .
the state department later added that the warning was not in response to any intelligence that suggested a strike was imminent at the 16-nation tournament , one of the world 's largest sporting events . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live euromaxx we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .
at least half a million people are expected to travel to portugal for euro 2004 , in addition to the usual 1.4 million tourists who visit the country each june .
earlier in may , the u.s. state department warned its citizens about the possibility of terrorist attacks and hooliganism at euro 2004 .
the state department later added that the warning was not in response to any intelligence that suggested a strike was imminent at the 16-nation tournament , one of the world 's largest sporting events . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live tomorrow today we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.05.2004 germany thrashes malta 's part-timers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking a lot happier than in romania last month the german national soccer team went some way to repairing its damaged reputation on thursday by beating malta 7-0 in a friendly match as part of its euro 2004 preparations . in a recent television interview , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned germany 's european soccer rivals that the national team should not be underestimated going into the euro 2004 tournament in portugal in june .
in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .

as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "

austrian president thomas klestil said that " all european countries should find a place at the heart of the union , as soon as they fulfill the adhesion criteria . "
the presidents of romania and bulgaria repeated their wish to conclude negotiations with the eu by the end of the year , so as to join the union in 2007 .
some of the countries represented at the summit are already eu members -lrb- austria , germany , hungary , poland , czech republic , slovakia and slovenia -rrb- .
others -lrb- bulgaria , romania , croatia , serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania , moldova and ukraine -rrb- are eu hopefuls .
the four western balkan countries -lrb- serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania -rrb- are hoping to join the eu between 2010 and 2015 .
moldova and ukraine have expressed a desire to join the union but enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has said that their accession is " not on the commission 's agenda . "
on friday the presidents will discuss the stability of the balkan region and how to get more investment in the region .
the mamaia summit is the 11th such gathering since germany , austria , hungary and the czech republic agreed in 1993 to launch a debate on closer ties between the european union and former eastern bloc countries .

the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country . as teams and supporters alike count the days to the european soccer championships in portugal in june , security forces across europe are doing the same but for very different reasons .
while the summer spectacle promises to be full of soccer drama , heartbreak and ecstasy , the threat looms that bringing the notorious supporters of some of europe 's most trouble-prone nations together again will erupt in violence .
at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .
german suspects forbidden to leave home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the relative successes of their border control operations at the last european championships , german police have already announced that some 4,500 reputed football hooligans will be prevented from travelling to portugal this summer .
however , despite german efforts at the last championships , hooligans escaped the " stop and search " initiative of 2000 in enough numbers to face off against their english rivals in belgium .
during the 1998 world cup in france , a group of german hooligans beat daniel nivel with a metal rod and a wooden board , leaving the french police officer in a coma for six weeks .

the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country . as teams and supporters alike count the days to the european soccer championships in portugal in june , security forces across europe are doing the same but for very different reasons .
while the summer spectacle promises to be full of soccer drama , heartbreak and ecstasy , the threat looms that bringing the notorious supporters of some of europe 's most trouble-prone nations together again will erupt in violence .
at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .
german suspects forbidden to leave home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the relative successes of their border control operations at the last european championships , german police have already announced that some 4,500 reputed football hooligans will be prevented from travelling to portugal this summer .
however , despite german efforts at the last championships , hooligans escaped the " stop and search " initiative of 2000 in enough numbers to face off against their english rivals in belgium .
during the 1998 world cup in france , a group of german hooligans beat daniel nivel with a metal rod and a wooden board , leaving the french police officer in a coma for six weeks .
police expect a large violent presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german police are under no illusions about the task at hand .
" we expect hooligans to be there in big numbers .
there 's considerable interest in the scene in the european championship , " said michael endler , head of the düsseldorf-based zis , the police department that handles hooligans , in an interview with der spiegel magazine earlier this year . in addition to suspending travel privileges for known trouble-makers , the zis will send a special unit of officers " knowledgeable about the scene " to travel with suspected german hooligans in an attempt to prevent violence during the soccer event , which runs until july 4 . according to der spiegel , germany 's police fear the proximity of portugal will encourage german hooligans to travel to the event via less secure routes such as by road , since airports , ports and railways stations will be home to designated undercover " spotters " ready to swoop on and deport anyone known to have a history of soccer violence . germany and britain pledge support german interior minister otto schily , responsible for the country 's sports , has promised the host nation that it would have germany 's full support against violence during euro 2004 in portugal . this move was mirrored by british home office minister hazel blears , who also recently assured the portuguese government that britain was doing all it could to keep england soccer hooligans away from euro 2004 . the british have already agreed to prevent around 2,500 hooligans from travelling to the three-week event by seizing their passports . massive operation underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and british police will be among at least 118 foreign officers working alongside their portuguese colleagues in one of the most expensive and widespread crackdowns on football hooligans in the history of the game and the biggest security operation ever staged in portugal . besides the 50,000 police in portugal , made up of the gendarmerie and state police , the portuguese government has spent some € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- on new police equipment , which includes more than 150 new police cars and the country 's first water cannon vehicles , as well as truncheons , riot gear , pepper spray and police dogs .
organizers have already switched the venues for two first-phase matches , involving germany , england and the netherlands , to bigger cities where policing of troublemakers would be easier .
officers to take tough action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general leonel carvalho , who heads the police security at the championship , said that his policy is one of gradually increasing response .
“ it goes from ‘ softly softly ’ to half-soft , to hard and then aggressive , ” he said .
“ we do not have the power to intervene to prevent anything happening .
we can only act afterwards .
if we arrest someone , we have to justify it . ”
the city of lisbon , which will host games in the opening group stage involving germany and the netherlands , has cancelled all police holiday leave during the finals and has pledged to hire another 2,000 officers to beef up security .
a squad of 2,000 officers has been given extra training for the tournament .
they will be armed , have truncheons and be able to use dogs and pepper gas to control unruly fans .

she said he will fulfill all that is legally required of him and register with local police early next week . the europe-wide manhunt for kaplan was called off late thursday evening .
this took some of the pressure off police , who showed up at his cologne apartment on wednesday only to find that kaplan had disappeared . but it has n't stopped the finger-pointing about who is to blame for the botched arrest attempt , or speculation about what damaging effects the incident is having on germany 's image abroad . major fiasco klaus jansen , the head of the german detective 's association -lrb- bdk -rrb- described the situation as a " major fiasco , " while the head of the police union , wolfgang speck , said the mishap proved that politicians still were n't taking terrorism seriously enough . a spokeswoman for the green party said the timing was a disaster for german authorities .

kaplan , who is wanted in turkey on charges of planning to carry out a major terrorist attack in 1998 , has been granted a stay of two months to appeal .
the arrest fiasco was the main subject for comment in the german papers , which almost without exception accuse the authorities of incompetence . how embarrassing , wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger : the explanations offered only show how miserably the security agencies co-operate .
police and domestic intelligence acted like an amateur theatre group against an allegedly highly dangerous extremist , the paper concluded . a state ruled by law makes a mockery of itself if , as in the kaplan case , it fails as soon as it has to carry out judgements , wrote the badische neueste nachrichten of karlsruhe . bonn ’ s general-anzeiger asked why kaplan wasn ’ t shadowed , observed and guarded on the day of days , when an appeals court was to decide his future .
why wasn ’ t there a police car at his front door , the paper wondered : how could this man , whose fundamentalist islamic organisation is banned , simply disappear ? the kölnische rundschau noted that for days it was common knowledge that the man who called openly for murder and holy war against “ infidels ” was to be expelled , so why wasn ’ t the strictest possible watch put on his cologne flat ?
police didn ’ t even check cars coming out of the high-rise building , it noted . the abendzeitung of munich said that people are asking themselves how security agencies are going to protect everyone from unrecognized or sleeping terrorists if they can ’ t even get hold of an islamist under orders to report to the police regularly . the kieler nachrichten thought : cynics might say the main thing is that he ’ s gone .
but that doesn ’ t make the mess-up more bearable . you might almost be tempted to think that those who want more stringent laws staged the kaplan case to underline the necessity for them , wrote the mindener tageblatt . in berlin , der tagesspiegel found that probably one has to be grateful to the “ caliph of cologne ” for provoking the question what use all the talk about biometric data in passports and other models is if the state can ’ t even use the instruments it ’ s got properly .
perhaps the kaplan case has happened just in time for the republic that has been spared islamic attacks so far to arm itself more strongly at last , the paper concluded . cologne ’ s express argued that it ’ s too pat to call for the heads of the cologne police chief and the state home affairs minister .
it looks as if the behaviour of the cologne police was legally beyond reproach , said the paper , and the politicians who want them to act differently have to provide other legal means of intervening . this has got nothing to do with weak laws or agency powers , commented the business daily handelsblatt , but a lot to do with dilettantism , sloppiness and squabbles over the respective responsibilities of federal and state authorities . the wetzlarer neue zeitung related the case to immigration and argued that metin kaplan ’ s escape shows yet again how urgently germany needs a functioning immigration law .
if the compromise just reached between the government and the opposition were law , said the paper , the self-styled caliph of cologne could not simply have disappeared .
as a dangerous foreigner he would have been under strict guard after the first court sentence against him .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .
at least half a million people are expected to travel to portugal for euro 2004 , in addition to the usual 1.4 million tourists who visit the country each june .
earlier in may , the u.s. state department warned its citizens about the possibility of terrorist attacks and hooliganism at euro 2004 .
the state department later added that the warning was not in response to any intelligence that suggested a strike was imminent at the 16-nation tournament , one of the world 's largest sporting events . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .
at least half a million people are expected to travel to portugal for euro 2004 , in addition to the usual 1.4 million tourists who visit the country each june .
earlier in may , the u.s. state department warned its citizens about the possibility of terrorist attacks and hooliganism at euro 2004 .
the state department later added that the warning was not in response to any intelligence that suggested a strike was imminent at the 16-nation tournament , one of the world 's largest sporting events . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

austria is one of the biggest backers of upholding the eu 's budget rules , which stipulate that no member of the 12 country euro zone may run a deficit of more than three percent of its gross domestic product .
under these rules - known in brussels jargon as the " stability and growth pact - countries can in theory be fined billions of euro if they consistently break this ceiling .
but this " sanctions procedure " was effectively suspended last november when france and germany - who have broken the rules for the past two years - persuaded their fellow finance ministers to suspend the procedure .
under grasser 's plan , both france and germany - which are expected to break the ceiling next year - would lose their voting power .
the european commission declined to comment on the specific proposals but welcomed the fact that member states were involving themselves in the debate over economic policy in the eu .

austrian president thomas klestil said that " all european countries should find a place at the heart of the union , as soon as they fulfill the adhesion criteria . "
the presidents of romania and bulgaria repeated their wish to conclude negotiations with the eu by the end of the year , so as to join the union in 2007 .
some of the countries represented at the summit are already eu members -lrb- austria , germany , hungary , poland , czech republic , slovakia and slovenia -rrb- .
others -lrb- bulgaria , romania , croatia , serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania , moldova and ukraine -rrb- are eu hopefuls .
the four western balkan countries -lrb- serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania -rrb- are hoping to join the eu between 2010 and 2015 .
moldova and ukraine have expressed a desire to join the union but enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has said that their accession is " not on the commission 's agenda . "
on friday the presidents will discuss the stability of the balkan region and how to get more investment in the region .
the mamaia summit is the 11th such gathering since germany , austria , hungary and the czech republic agreed in 1993 to launch a debate on closer ties between the european union and former eastern bloc countries .

austrian president thomas klestil said that " all european countries should find a place at the heart of the union , as soon as they fulfill the adhesion criteria . "
the presidents of romania and bulgaria repeated their wish to conclude negotiations with the eu by the end of the year , so as to join the union in 2007 .
some of the countries represented at the summit are already eu members -lrb- austria , germany , hungary , poland , czech republic , slovakia and slovenia -rrb- .
others -lrb- bulgaria , romania , croatia , serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania , moldova and ukraine -rrb- are eu hopefuls .
the four western balkan countries -lrb- serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania -rrb- are hoping to join the eu between 2010 and 2015 .
moldova and ukraine have expressed a desire to join the union but enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has said that their accession is " not on the commission 's agenda . "
on friday the presidents will discuss the stability of the balkan region and how to get more investment in the region .
the mamaia summit is the 11th such gathering since germany , austria , hungary and the czech republic agreed in 1993 to launch a debate on closer ties between the european union and former eastern bloc countries .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .

ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .

germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "

coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "

the two most important working groups in the eu , the terrorism working group , made up of member states ' representatives , and the working party on terrorism , consisting of foreign ministries representatives , work separately from each other , are not integrated in brussels decision-making processes and only meet once a year .
furthermore , there are many eu committees which are involved only in some aspects of terrorism , while there is no committee dealing with the financing of terror .
" the current structures are based on artificial pillar structures and in brussels there is not even a body that co-ordinates the activities of the different committees , " de vries writes in his report .
de vries has made three alternative proposals to improve co-ordination .
the first option is the launch of a new eu ' high-level group ' on terrorism , while a second idea is to merge the terrorism working group and the working party on terrorism into one single body .
a third possibility is the conservation of the current structure , whereby the member states ' permament representatives in brussels -lrb- coreper -rrb- would co-ordinate the different committees in a more systematic way .
diplomatic sources say according to belga that many member states favor the last option and do not want to create new bodies .

the two most important working groups in the eu , the terrorism working group , made up of member states ' representatives , and the working party on terrorism , consisting of foreign ministries representatives , work separately from each other , are not integrated in brussels decision-making processes and only meet once a year .
furthermore , there are many eu committees which are involved only in some aspects of terrorism , while there is no committee dealing with the financing of terror .
" the current structures are based on artificial pillar structures and in brussels there is not even a body that co-ordinates the activities of the different committees , " de vries writes in his report .
de vries has made three alternative proposals to improve co-ordination .
the first option is the launch of a new eu ' high-level group ' on terrorism , while a second idea is to merge the terrorism working group and the working party on terrorism into one single body .
a third possibility is the conservation of the current structure , whereby the member states ' permament representatives in brussels -lrb- coreper -rrb- would co-ordinate the different committees in a more systematic way .
diplomatic sources say according to belga that many member states favor the last option and do not want to create new bodies .
but de vries states in his report that coreper does not have the time to engage in more work .
a new organ would therefore be necessary .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.05.2004 german press review : the search for kaplan german editorials on friday commented on the disappearance of islamic extremist metin kaplan after a court ruled he could be extradicted to turkey . a europe-wide search was launched on thursday , then called off just hours later , amid confusion over the details of wednesday ’ s court rulings on the deportation .
kaplan , who is wanted in turkey on charges of planning to carry out a major terrorist attack in 1998 , has been granted a stay of two months to appeal .
the arrest fiasco was the main subject for comment in the german papers , which almost without exception accuse the authorities of incompetence . how embarrassing , wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger : the explanations offered only show how miserably the security agencies co-operate .
police and domestic intelligence acted like an amateur theatre group against an allegedly highly dangerous extremist , the paper concluded . a state ruled by law makes a mockery of itself if , as in the kaplan case , it fails as soon as it has to carry out judgements , wrote the badische neueste nachrichten of karlsruhe . bonn ’ s general-anzeiger asked why kaplan wasn ’ t shadowed , observed and guarded on the day of days , when an appeals court was to decide his future .
why wasn ’ t there a police car at his front door , the paper wondered : how could this man , whose fundamentalist islamic organisation is banned , simply disappear ? the kölnische rundschau noted that for days it was common knowledge that the man who called openly for murder and holy war against “ infidels ” was to be expelled , so why wasn ’ t the strictest possible watch put on his cologne flat ?
police didn ’ t even check cars coming out of the high-rise building , it noted . the abendzeitung of munich said that people are asking themselves how security agencies are going to protect everyone from unrecognized or sleeping terrorists if they can ’ t even get hold of an islamist under orders to report to the police regularly . the kieler nachrichten thought : cynics might say the main thing is that he ’ s gone .
but that doesn ’ t make the mess-up more bearable . you might almost be tempted to think that those who want more stringent laws staged the kaplan case to underline the necessity for them , wrote the mindener tageblatt . in berlin , der tagesspiegel found that probably one has to be grateful to the “ caliph of cologne ” for provoking the question what use all the talk about biometric data in passports and other models is if the state can ’ t even use the instruments it ’ s got properly .
perhaps the kaplan case has happened just in time for the republic that has been spared islamic attacks so far to arm itself more strongly at last , the paper concluded . cologne ’ s express argued that it ’ s too pat to call for the heads of the cologne police chief and the state home affairs minister .
it looks as if the behaviour of the cologne police was legally beyond reproach , said the paper , and the politicians who want them to act differently have to provide other legal means of intervening . this has got nothing to do with weak laws or agency powers , commented the business daily handelsblatt , but a lot to do with dilettantism , sloppiness and squabbles over the respective responsibilities of federal and state authorities . the wetzlarer neue zeitung related the case to immigration and argued that metin kaplan ’ s escape shows yet again how urgently germany needs a functioning immigration law .
if the compromise just reached between the government and the opposition were law , said the paper , the self-styled caliph of cologne could not simply have disappeared .
as a dangerous foreigner he would have been under strict guard after the first court sentence against him .
he ’ d have had taken off him the means of communication that probably now helped him prepare his escape , the daily concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

kaplan , who is wanted in turkey on charges of planning to carry out a major terrorist attack in 1998 , has been granted a stay of two months to appeal .
the arrest fiasco was the main subject for comment in the german papers , which almost without exception accuse the authorities of incompetence . how embarrassing , wrote the kölner stadt-anzeiger : the explanations offered only show how miserably the security agencies co-operate .
police and domestic intelligence acted like an amateur theatre group against an allegedly highly dangerous extremist , the paper concluded . a state ruled by law makes a mockery of itself if , as in the kaplan case , it fails as soon as it has to carry out judgements , wrote the badische neueste nachrichten of karlsruhe . bonn ’ s general-anzeiger asked why kaplan wasn ’ t shadowed , observed and guarded on the day of days , when an appeals court was to decide his future .
why wasn ’ t there a police car at his front door , the paper wondered : how could this man , whose fundamentalist islamic organisation is banned , simply disappear ? the kölnische rundschau noted that for days it was common knowledge that the man who called openly for murder and holy war against “ infidels ” was to be expelled , so why wasn ’ t the strictest possible watch put on his cologne flat ?
police didn ’ t even check cars coming out of the high-rise building , it noted . the abendzeitung of munich said that people are asking themselves how security agencies are going to protect everyone from unrecognized or sleeping terrorists if they can ’ t even get hold of an islamist under orders to report to the police regularly . the kieler nachrichten thought : cynics might say the main thing is that he ’ s gone .
but that doesn ’ t make the mess-up more bearable . you might almost be tempted to think that those who want more stringent laws staged the kaplan case to underline the necessity for them , wrote the mindener tageblatt . in berlin , der tagesspiegel found that probably one has to be grateful to the “ caliph of cologne ” for provoking the question what use all the talk about biometric data in passports and other models is if the state can ’ t even use the instruments it ’ s got properly .
perhaps the kaplan case has happened just in time for the republic that has been spared islamic attacks so far to arm itself more strongly at last , the paper concluded . cologne ’ s express argued that it ’ s too pat to call for the heads of the cologne police chief and the state home affairs minister .
it looks as if the behaviour of the cologne police was legally beyond reproach , said the paper , and the politicians who want them to act differently have to provide other legal means of intervening . this has got nothing to do with weak laws or agency powers , commented the business daily handelsblatt , but a lot to do with dilettantism , sloppiness and squabbles over the respective responsibilities of federal and state authorities . the wetzlarer neue zeitung related the case to immigration and argued that metin kaplan ’ s escape shows yet again how urgently germany needs a functioning immigration law .
if the compromise just reached between the government and the opposition were law , said the paper , the self-styled caliph of cologne could not simply have disappeared .

the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country . as teams and supporters alike count the days to the european soccer championships in portugal in june , security forces across europe are doing the same but for very different reasons .
while the summer spectacle promises to be full of soccer drama , heartbreak and ecstasy , the threat looms that bringing the notorious supporters of some of europe 's most trouble-prone nations together again will erupt in violence .
at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .
german suspects forbidden to leave home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the relative successes of their border control operations at the last european championships , german police have already announced that some 4,500 reputed football hooligans will be prevented from travelling to portugal this summer .
however , despite german efforts at the last championships , hooligans escaped the " stop and search " initiative of 2000 in enough numbers to face off against their english rivals in belgium .
during the 1998 world cup in france , a group of german hooligans beat daniel nivel with a metal rod and a wooden board , leaving the french police officer in a coma for six weeks .
police expect a large violent presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german police are under no illusions about the task at hand .
" we expect hooligans to be there in big numbers .
there 's considerable interest in the scene in the european championship , " said michael endler , head of the düsseldorf-based zis , the police department that handles hooligans , in an interview with der spiegel magazine earlier this year . in addition to suspending travel privileges for known trouble-makers , the zis will send a special unit of officers " knowledgeable about the scene " to travel with suspected german hooligans in an attempt to prevent violence during the soccer event , which runs until july 4 . according to der spiegel , germany 's police fear the proximity of portugal will encourage german hooligans to travel to the event via less secure routes such as by road , since airports , ports and railways stations will be home to designated undercover " spotters " ready to swoop on and deport anyone known to have a history of soccer violence . germany and britain pledge support german interior minister otto schily , responsible for the country 's sports , has promised the host nation that it would have germany 's full support against violence during euro 2004 in portugal . this move was mirrored by british home office minister hazel blears , who also recently assured the portuguese government that britain was doing all it could to keep england soccer hooligans away from euro 2004 . the british have already agreed to prevent around 2,500 hooligans from travelling to the three-week event by seizing their passports . massive operation underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and british police will be among at least 118 foreign officers working alongside their portuguese colleagues in one of the most expensive and widespread crackdowns on football hooligans in the history of the game and the biggest security operation ever staged in portugal . besides the 50,000 police in portugal , made up of the gendarmerie and state police , the portuguese government has spent some € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- on new police equipment , which includes more than 150 new police cars and the country 's first water cannon vehicles , as well as truncheons , riot gear , pepper spray and police dogs .
organizers have already switched the venues for two first-phase matches , involving germany , england and the netherlands , to bigger cities where policing of troublemakers would be easier .
officers to take tough action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general leonel carvalho , who heads the police security at the championship , said that his policy is one of gradually increasing response .
“ it goes from ‘ softly softly ’ to half-soft , to hard and then aggressive , ” he said .
“ we do not have the power to intervene to prevent anything happening .
we can only act afterwards .
if we arrest someone , we have to justify it . ”
the city of lisbon , which will host games in the opening group stage involving germany and the netherlands , has cancelled all police holiday leave during the finals and has pledged to hire another 2,000 officers to beef up security .
a squad of 2,000 officers has been given extra training for the tournament .
they will be armed , have truncheons and be able to use dogs and pepper gas to control unruly fans .
some will reinforce local officers at the resorts along the 724 kilometers -lrb- 450 miles -rrb- of coastline , where most of the supporters are expected to stay . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de championship hosts equipped to deal with terror portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals .

the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country . as teams and supporters alike count the days to the european soccer championships in portugal in june , security forces across europe are doing the same but for very different reasons .
while the summer spectacle promises to be full of soccer drama , heartbreak and ecstasy , the threat looms that bringing the notorious supporters of some of europe 's most trouble-prone nations together again will erupt in violence .
at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .
german suspects forbidden to leave home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the relative successes of their border control operations at the last european championships , german police have already announced that some 4,500 reputed football hooligans will be prevented from travelling to portugal this summer .
however , despite german efforts at the last championships , hooligans escaped the " stop and search " initiative of 2000 in enough numbers to face off against their english rivals in belgium .
during the 1998 world cup in france , a group of german hooligans beat daniel nivel with a metal rod and a wooden board , leaving the french police officer in a coma for six weeks .

there 's considerable interest in the scene in the european championship , " said michael endler , head of the düsseldorf-based zis , the police department that handles hooligans , in an interview with der spiegel magazine earlier this year . in addition to suspending travel privileges for known trouble-makers , the zis will send a special unit of officers " knowledgeable about the scene " to travel with suspected german hooligans in an attempt to prevent violence during the soccer event , which runs until july 4 . according to der spiegel , germany 's police fear the proximity of portugal will encourage german hooligans to travel to the event via less secure routes such as by road , since airports , ports and railways stations will be home to designated undercover " spotters " ready to swoop on and deport anyone known to have a history of soccer violence . germany and britain pledge support german interior minister otto schily , responsible for the country 's sports , has promised the host nation that it would have germany 's full support against violence during euro 2004 in portugal . this move was mirrored by british home office minister hazel blears , who also recently assured the portuguese government that britain was doing all it could to keep england soccer hooligans away from euro 2004 . the british have already agreed to prevent around 2,500 hooligans from travelling to the three-week event by seizing their passports . massive operation underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and british police will be among at least 118 foreign officers working alongside their portuguese colleagues in one of the most expensive and widespread crackdowns on football hooligans in the history of the game and the biggest security operation ever staged in portugal . besides the 50,000 police in portugal , made up of the gendarmerie and state police , the portuguese government has spent some € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- on new police equipment , which includes more than 150 new police cars and the country 's first water cannon vehicles , as well as truncheons , riot gear , pepper spray and police dogs .
organizers have already switched the venues for two first-phase matches , involving germany , england and the netherlands , to bigger cities where policing of troublemakers would be easier .
officers to take tough action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general leonel carvalho , who heads the police security at the championship , said that his policy is one of gradually increasing response .
“ it goes from ‘ softly softly ’ to half-soft , to hard and then aggressive , ” he said .
“ we do not have the power to intervene to prevent anything happening .
we can only act afterwards .
if we arrest someone , we have to justify it . ”
the city of lisbon , which will host games in the opening group stage involving germany and the netherlands , has cancelled all police holiday leave during the finals and has pledged to hire another 2,000 officers to beef up security .
a squad of 2,000 officers has been given extra training for the tournament .
they will be armed , have truncheons and be able to use dogs and pepper gas to control unruly fans .
some will reinforce local officers at the resorts along the 724 kilometers -lrb- 450 miles -rrb- of coastline , where most of the supporters are expected to stay . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de championship hosts equipped to deal with terror portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals .

austrian president thomas klestil said that " all european countries should find a place at the heart of the union , as soon as they fulfill the adhesion criteria . "
the presidents of romania and bulgaria repeated their wish to conclude negotiations with the eu by the end of the year , so as to join the union in 2007 .
some of the countries represented at the summit are already eu members -lrb- austria , germany , hungary , poland , czech republic , slovakia and slovenia -rrb- .
others -lrb- bulgaria , romania , croatia , serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania , moldova and ukraine -rrb- are eu hopefuls .
the four western balkan countries -lrb- serbia-montenegro , bosnia-herzegovina , macedonia , albania -rrb- are hoping to join the eu between 2010 and 2015 .
moldova and ukraine have expressed a desire to join the union but enlargement commissioner günter verheugen has said that their accession is " not on the commission 's agenda . "
on friday the presidents will discuss the stability of the balkan region and how to get more investment in the region .
the mamaia summit is the 11th such gathering since germany , austria , hungary and the czech republic agreed in 1993 to launch a debate on closer ties between the european union and former eastern bloc countries .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .
at least half a million people are expected to travel to portugal for euro 2004 , in addition to the usual 1.4 million tourists who visit the country each june .
earlier in may , the u.s. state department warned its citizens about the possibility of terrorist attacks and hooliganism at euro 2004 .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .

völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .

ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .

beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .

germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .

the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country . as teams and supporters alike count the days to the european soccer championships in portugal in june , security forces across europe are doing the same but for very different reasons .
while the summer spectacle promises to be full of soccer drama , heartbreak and ecstasy , the threat looms that bringing the notorious supporters of some of europe 's most trouble-prone nations together again will erupt in violence .
at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .
german suspects forbidden to leave home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the relative successes of their border control operations at the last european championships , german police have already announced that some 4,500 reputed football hooligans will be prevented from travelling to portugal this summer .
however , despite german efforts at the last championships , hooligans escaped the " stop and search " initiative of 2000 in enough numbers to face off against their english rivals in belgium .
during the 1998 world cup in france , a group of german hooligans beat daniel nivel with a metal rod and a wooden board , leaving the french police officer in a coma for six weeks .
police expect a large violent presence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german police are under no illusions about the task at hand .
" we expect hooligans to be there in big numbers .
there 's considerable interest in the scene in the european championship , " said michael endler , head of the düsseldorf-based zis , the police department that handles hooligans , in an interview with der spiegel magazine earlier this year . in addition to suspending travel privileges for known trouble-makers , the zis will send a special unit of officers " knowledgeable about the scene " to travel with suspected german hooligans in an attempt to prevent violence during the soccer event , which runs until july 4 . according to der spiegel , germany 's police fear the proximity of portugal will encourage german hooligans to travel to the event via less secure routes such as by road , since airports , ports and railways stations will be home to designated undercover " spotters " ready to swoop on and deport anyone known to have a history of soccer violence . germany and britain pledge support german interior minister otto schily , responsible for the country 's sports , has promised the host nation that it would have germany 's full support against violence during euro 2004 in portugal . this move was mirrored by british home office minister hazel blears , who also recently assured the portuguese government that britain was doing all it could to keep england soccer hooligans away from euro 2004 . the british have already agreed to prevent around 2,500 hooligans from travelling to the three-week event by seizing their passports . massive operation underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and british police will be among at least 118 foreign officers working alongside their portuguese colleagues in one of the most expensive and widespread crackdowns on football hooligans in the history of the game and the biggest security operation ever staged in portugal . besides the 50,000 police in portugal , made up of the gendarmerie and state police , the portuguese government has spent some € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 21 million -rrb- on new police equipment , which includes more than 150 new police cars and the country 's first water cannon vehicles , as well as truncheons , riot gear , pepper spray and police dogs .
organizers have already switched the venues for two first-phase matches , involving germany , england and the netherlands , to bigger cities where policing of troublemakers would be easier .
officers to take tough action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general leonel carvalho , who heads the police security at the championship , said that his policy is one of gradually increasing response .
“ it goes from ‘ softly softly ’ to half-soft , to hard and then aggressive , ” he said .
“ we do not have the power to intervene to prevent anything happening .
we can only act afterwards .
if we arrest someone , we have to justify it . ”
the city of lisbon , which will host games in the opening group stage involving germany and the netherlands , has cancelled all police holiday leave during the finals and has pledged to hire another 2,000 officers to beef up security .
a squad of 2,000 officers has been given extra training for the tournament .
they will be armed , have truncheons and be able to use dogs and pepper gas to control unruly fans .
some will reinforce local officers at the resorts along the 724 kilometers -lrb- 450 miles -rrb- of coastline , where most of the supporters are expected to stay . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de championship hosts equipped to deal with terror portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals .

at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .

the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .

the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country . as teams and supporters alike count the days to the european soccer championships in portugal in june , security forces across europe are doing the same but for very different reasons .
while the summer spectacle promises to be full of soccer drama , heartbreak and ecstasy , the threat looms that bringing the notorious supporters of some of europe 's most trouble-prone nations together again will erupt in violence .
at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .
german suspects forbidden to leave home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the relative successes of their border control operations at the last european championships , german police have already announced that some 4,500 reputed football hooligans will be prevented from travelling to portugal this summer .
however , despite german efforts at the last championships , hooligans escaped the " stop and search " initiative of 2000 in enough numbers to face off against their english rivals in belgium .
during the 1998 world cup in france , a group of german hooligans beat daniel nivel with a metal rod and a wooden board , leaving the french police officer in a coma for six weeks .

the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country . as teams and supporters alike count the days to the european soccer championships in portugal in june , security forces across europe are doing the same but for very different reasons .
while the summer spectacle promises to be full of soccer drama , heartbreak and ecstasy , the threat looms that bringing the notorious supporters of some of europe 's most trouble-prone nations together again will erupt in violence .
at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .
german suspects forbidden to leave home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the relative successes of their border control operations at the last european championships , german police have already announced that some 4,500 reputed football hooligans will be prevented from travelling to portugal this summer .
however , despite german efforts at the last championships , hooligans escaped the " stop and search " initiative of 2000 in enough numbers to face off against their english rivals in belgium .
during the 1998 world cup in france , a group of german hooligans beat daniel nivel with a metal rod and a wooden board , leaving the french police officer in a coma for six weeks .

while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .

the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country . as teams and supporters alike count the days to the european soccer championships in portugal in june , security forces across europe are doing the same but for very different reasons .
while the summer spectacle promises to be full of soccer drama , heartbreak and ecstasy , the threat looms that bringing the notorious supporters of some of europe 's most trouble-prone nations together again will erupt in violence .
at the last championships in 2000 , hosted jointly by belgium and the netherlands , 850 mostly english fans were arrested after running riot in the center of brussels and charleroi .
while commonly known as " the english disease , " soccer hooliganism has found willing hosts in many rival countries and has spawned outbreaks of violence at as many as four of the past six european tournaments .
the prospect of hooligans affiliated to such notoriously aggressive rivals as the english , german and dutch teams coming together this time on the streets of portugal has forced european police to increase their efforts to weed out organized groups and trouble-making individuals before the championships kick-off on june 12 .
german suspects forbidden to leave home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the relative successes of their border control operations at the last european championships , german police have already announced that some 4,500 reputed football hooligans will be prevented from travelling to portugal this summer .
however , despite german efforts at the last championships , hooligans escaped the " stop and search " initiative of 2000 in enough numbers to face off against their english rivals in belgium .
during the 1998 world cup in france , a group of german hooligans beat daniel nivel with a metal rod and a wooden board , leaving the french police officer in a coma for six weeks .

portugal may have already spent millions on security in preparation for possible hooliganism at the euro 2004 championships but authorities have said it is equally ready to avert any terror strike at the finals . just as it is impossible to predict where and when rival sets of soccer hooligans will clash , it is also impossible to say whether such an international event as the european championships in portugal will be the target for a terrorist attack .
but just as the portuguese authorities have been preparing for confrontations between rival supporters , security procedures regarding a possible terror threat have also been increased ahead of the soccer showpiece .
according to prime minister jose manuel durao barroso portugal is equipped to face a possible terrorist attack when it hosts the three-week finals in june .
" no responsible government can say that a terrorist attack will not take place .
on the contrary , today any responsible government knows that these threats exist , " he told reporters following a meeting with portugal 's president jorge sampaio and the chiefs of the country 's security and military forces .
" what i can responsibly say is that today we have means at our disposal which we never had before and we are determined to provide security as never before . "
budget increased for security portugal has already cancelled all police leave during the tournament , hired new officers and spent € 16.5 million -lrb- $ 19.8 million -rrb- on new police equipment , including the country 's first water cannon vehicles , to prepare for the possibility of fan violence at the finals .
but concern has been growing in portugal after the march 11 commuter train bombings in neighboring spain which killed 191 people .
since then , the focus has moved away from the containment of hooligan elements towards combating the risk of a terrorist strike .
passport introductions and nato help with the madrid bombings still fresh in the mind , the authorities in lisbon have decided to temporarily reintroduce passport controls with other european nations before the start of the tournament and have asked nato for radar surveillance planes to help bolster security during the event .
the concern is also shared throughout the global community as supporters and visitors from all over the world prepare to head for portugal for the soccer showcase .
at least half a million people are expected to travel to portugal for euro 2004 , in addition to the usual 1.4 million tourists who visit the country each june .
earlier in may , the u.s. state department warned its citizens about the possibility of terrorist attacks and hooliganism at euro 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes " mcberti " takes on his former team german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.05.2004 germany thrashes malta 's part-timers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : looking a lot happier than in romania last month the german national soccer team went some way to repairing its damaged reputation on thursday by beating malta 7-0 in a friendly match as part of its euro 2004 preparations . in a recent television interview , german chancellor gerhard schröder warned germany 's european soccer rivals that the national team should not be underestimated going into the euro 2004 tournament in portugal in june .
in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .

as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .

one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .
four-goal ballack regains confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballack looks to be growing in confidence after a bad season .
ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .

in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes .
the clear victory was tempered somewhat by the news that midfielder paul freier would most likely miss the euro tournament after injuring himself during the game .
freier 's injury means that völler is likely to nominate teen sensation lukas podolski , a striker for under 21 team , to the national team .
völler has praised podolski , 18 , and acknowledged he is a hot candidate for the final spot on the national team , which völler left open after naming his squad this week .
with freier out , podolski is all but guaranteed a nomination , leaving völler with more choices to fill his final spot .
stand and deliver germany finally stepped up to be counted in the friendly game against malta in freiburg 's dreisam stadium and , despite facing a team of part-timers who were reduced to 10 men for the last 12 minutes of the match , dispatched the opposition with an overwhelming display which culminated in an impressive 7-0 victory .
malta 's team was no match for the germans who were driven on by midfielder michael ballack who put on a personal master class which must have reminded those who had forgotten why he was once rated so highly after his outstanding performances in the 2002 world cup .
the bayern munich star scored twice in each half to increase his international total to 19 goals in 39 matches .

ballack opened the scoring with a low shot from 20 yards after 15 minutes and as the increasingly one-sided game progressed , the player who had faced much criticism this season added three more goals to the tally all from headers .
the germans were rarely troubled by the visitors despite missing central defender christian wörns , who is fighting to be fit for the upcoming european championships as he battles with a hip injury , and first choice goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn , who was rested .
striker thomas brdaric , the surprise package of rudi völler 's squad for portugal , sat out the match with a thigh muscle strain .
fabian ernst and frank baumann , two euro 2004 squad members from recently crowned bundesliga champions werder bremen , were not available for the game due to their club 's involvement in the german cup final against second division alemannia aachen which is to be played on saturday .
attacking spectacle stuns opposition and fans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's fredi bobic got on the score sheet against malta .
germany swarmed over the visitors in energetic attacking waves for most of the match leaving malta - and the pleasantly surprised home crowd - breathless .
as the maltese eventually succumbed and crumbled , jens nowotny , torsten frings and fredi bobic -lrb- photo -rrb- all weighed in with goals as germany made a valiant attempt to exorcise the ghosts of bucharest .
germany had been all but written off after the dramatic thrashing at the hands of a young romanian side in april .
retreating to a black forest hideaway on tuesday to prepare after the close of the league season , völler gathered his team together to plot their resurgence away from a media that has become increasingly scathing since the world cup defeat at the hands of brazil two years ago and which reached fever pitch after the heavy loss last month .
speaking before thursday night 's game , the coach was well aware of what was required : " the team has to deliver after the ominous match in romania .
the 5-1 loss did us harm .
we must overcome this .
one must feel that we are hot for euro 2004 . "
beckenbauer offers cautious opinion völler not only has the weight of a country 's expectation and a ravenous press to convince but also some of his contemporaries who have voiced their skepticism over germany 's chances .
german soccer monarch franz beckenbauer recently declared that a semi-final place was the most he could hope for .
" if rudi völler 's team can survive the first round , they might be able to reach the semifinals , " he said .
however , the former national coach and player conceded that he was willing to be proved wrong : " the past has shown that the germans are a tournament team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rudi völler has faced a tough time from all quarters as germany 's form has dipped .
the current coach will take heart from the 7-0 victory over malta but will appreciate there are much tougher challenges ahead and will prepare accordingly .
" we will train in such a way that the players will be in top shape in portugal .
i know that the players wo n't be happy , but it is important , " völler said .
coach to work players hard " it is important that key players like ballack go into the tournament in top form - not only physically , but mentally as well . "
four goals for the bayern playmaker will have gone a long way to restoring his confidence ahead of the championships .
germany 's first match in a tough qualifying pool known as the " group of death " is against the netherlands on june 15 .
germany also plays the czech republic and newcomer latvia in the group stage .
the team will fly out to portugal six days before the holland match after the final two games of its preparation schedule against fellow qualifier switzerland on june 2 and hungary on june 6.ated in the imminent euro 2004 tournament in portugal .
in what could have been a reiteration of the chancellor 's statement , rudi völler 's team did more than enough on thursday night to suggest last month 's stunning 5-1 loss to non-qualifier romania could well be a turning point in their fortunes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german soccer humiliated in bucharest it could hardly have been a worse preparation for the upcoming european championships .

mr agnelli , 69 , was appointed fiat chairman in february last year after the death of his brother , legendary fiat chairman gianni agnelli .
mr agnelli 's death comes amidst weak sales and large losses at the group 's heavily indebted car unit fiat auto .
his illness had prevented him from attending fiat 's agm on 11 may .
prior to becoming fiat chairman , mr agnelli had been head of his family 's holding companies , ifi and ifil , the firm 's main shareholders .
creditors circling he had also previously served in a variety of roles within the fiat organisation , including a long stint as chief executive of fiat auto during the 1980s .
he was seen as a conservative choice for the fiat chairmanship , vacated by paolo frescore in a management reshuffle after gianni agnelli 's death .
gianni agnelli , the industrialist credited with transforming fiat from an obscure italian car maker into a major force in the global automotive industry as well as other industries , was the firm 's honorary chairman when he died .
the loss of umberto agnelli could loosen the agnelli dynasty 's grip on the industrial empire it founded more than 100 years ago .
mr agnelli had adopted a strategy of nursing fiat 's core car business back to health , but the group remains under pressure to put the auto unit up for sale .
fiat 's creditor banks have an option to convert the firm 's 3bn euro debt into shares next year , a move which would make them the company 's biggest shareholders .
fiat auto 's other main owners include us car giant general motors , which holds a 10 % stake .
two weeks ago , fiat said losses for the first three months of 2004 came in at 158m euros -lrb- $ 187m ; £ 106m -rrb- , down from 342m euros during the same period last year .

dr clifford stott , a psychologist from the university of liverpool , says low-profile policing should be used during the euro 2004 tournament .
he is working with authorities in portugal to help improve security at the games .
in research published in the psychologist , he says using a friendly approach is the most effective tactic .
he has been working with otto m j adang of the netherlands police to advise the portuguese public security police -lrb- psp -rrb- on their tactics .
dr stott said research into travelling english fans over the past three years showed " indiscriminate heavy-handed policing " angered ordinary fans , uniting them in opposition to the police .
he said most cases of large-scale disorder resulted from this situation .
" this had the effect of drawing ordinary fans into conflict with the police , " he said .
" we discovered that employing riot police to tackle the problem of hooliganism during euro 2000 was at best ineffectual and at worst counterproductive .
portuguese police have been kitted out to deal with trouble " fans who would normally have no intention of engaging in hooliganism came to see conflict with the police as acceptable . "
convicted hooligans and those thought to be troublemakers are to be banned from going to the tournament .
portuguese police and immigration officers are in london to decide whether individuals should be refused entry to portugal .
british police spotters will also be in portugal and spain keeping tabs on the england fans .

dr clifford stott , a psychologist from the university of liverpool , says low-profile policing should be used during the euro 2004 tournament .
he is working with authorities in portugal to help improve security at the games .
in research published in the psychologist , he says using a friendly approach is the most effective tactic .
he has been working with otto m j adang of the netherlands police to advise the portuguese public security police -lrb- psp -rrb- on their tactics .
dr stott said research into travelling english fans over the past three years showed " indiscriminate heavy-handed policing " angered ordinary fans , uniting them in opposition to the police .
he said most cases of large-scale disorder resulted from this situation .
" this had the effect of drawing ordinary fans into conflict with the police , " he said .
" we discovered that employing riot police to tackle the problem of hooliganism during euro 2000 was at best ineffectual and at worst counterproductive .
portuguese police have been kitted out to deal with trouble " fans who would normally have no intention of engaging in hooliganism came to see conflict with the police as acceptable . "
convicted hooligans and those thought to be troublemakers are to be banned from going to the tournament .
portuguese police and immigration officers are in london to decide whether individuals should be refused entry to portugal .
british police spotters will also be in portugal and spain keeping tabs on the england fans .
portugal has also formally reimposed border controls with other european countries to improve security and police have been given new riot control equipment .
dr stott added : " we hope that our research will provide the basis for a much more effective policing strategy which will reduce the incidence of large-scale disorder during euro 2004 .
" police do not need to ' control ' hooligans to achieve a relatively peaceful tournament but simply employ a combination of low-profile policing and positive engagement with fans . "

david arculus , chairman of the better regulation task force , said fear of claims was making town halls and other groups cancel events unnecessarily .
his new report also calls for claims management companies to create a code of practice by the end of next year or face government regulation .
it also condemns " no win , no fee " advertising in hospitals .
the watchdog worries that " no win , no fee " cases have become too complex in recent years .
and in too many cases , solicitors on the losing sides try to challenge the other lawyers ' conditional fee arrangements , pushing up costs .
the watchdog says the government should give " serious thought " to alternatives for conditional fee arrangements if those concerns remain in two years time .
falling claims mr arculus argues an " urban myth " of spurious compensation claims , partly propagated by the media , had led to some businesses becoming less innovative .
he says : " the compensation culture is a myth but the cost of this belief is very real . "
we find this sort of advertising totally distasteful " better regulation task force on hospital adverts " almost everyone we spoke to in the course of this study told us that they did not believe that there is a compensation culture in the uk .
" they argued that the reality is somewhat different because the number of accident claims , including personal injury claims , is going down . "
balance needed the report suggests that the outcomes of litigation cases often go unreported in the media and many claims actually never make it to court .
it says one large council spent more than £ 2m out of its £ 22m roads budget on tackling compensation claims in 2003-4 .
that cost would come to a " staggering figure " if it were replicated over all 409 local authorities in england and wales .
insurance premiums have also risen .
but often schools , rather than cancelling trips , have become much better at assessing risks .
regulation threat the report continues : " of course , some of the claims ... will be genuine but a large number will be vexatious or frivolous . "
the claims standards federation , which represents firms offering " no win , no fee " actions , should set out a code of practice by september next year .
if it fails to do so , the government should step in to regulate the industry .
some hospitals and gps ' surgeries are paid to carry advertisements for claims companies but the task force is not convinced this is the most appropriate way for the nhs to get funding .
it points to one poster which asked : " did the doctor or nurse make you worse ? "
court changes ?
telephone numbers of a claims management company were also sometimes printed on the back of appointment cards .
" we find this sort of advertising totally distasteful , " says the report .
" the vast majority of doctors and nurses do not deliberately set out to harm patients ...
" whilst it would be difficult to ban such advertising we would like to see strict guidelines on such advertising introduced . "
cost figures the report urges the nhs chief executive to issue immediately guidelines to hospitals and surgeries on the content of such adverts , which could also feature details of in-house nhs complaints system .
and for advertisements more generally the regulators should enforce the rules more rigorously , it says .
the watchdog also presses the government to examine the impact of allowing small claims courts to hear more personal injury cases .
the courts ' current claims limit of just £ 1,000 could be extended , it suggests .
recent figures showing claims against schools have risen to £ 200m a year - enough to pay for about 8,000 new teachers .
similarly , nhs medical error claims rose from £ 1m in 1974 to £ 477m in 2003 - equal to 22,700 extra nurses .

his new report also calls for claims management companies to create a code of practice by the end of next year or face government regulation .

the watchdog worries that " no win , no fee " cases have become too complex in recent years .

arculus says new guidelines are needed for nhs adverts that cost would come to a " staggering figure " if it were replicated over all 409 local authorities in england and wales .

the firm revealed it had narrowed its pre-tax loss to £ 199.6m -lrb- $ 364.5m -rrb- for the six months of the year , from £ 617.9m for the same period in 2003 .
the group is currently struggling to manage its debts after a disastrous expansion drive and accounting errors .
chief peter mchugh said the turnaround of the business is " well underway " but may take longer than expected .
mr mchugh added that the level of losses remained too high for the winter period .
high costs the uk division had a " difficult start " in may with further evidence that customers were leaving their bookings until later .
although there is still more to be done , we are ahead of schedule on delivering the cost savings and believe that they are now likely to exceed the target of £ 150m in 2005 peter mchugh , mytravel travel firms are still fighting to recover from a drop in tourism during the recent economic downturn - which has been exacerbated by terrorism fears .
mytravel , formerly known as airtours , was hit harder than most firms during the slump as it had ramped up capacity - buying aircraft , hotels and cruise ships - in an effort to grab market share .
as a result the rochdale-based firm was lumbered with high fixed costs and was forced to cut prices for its unsold holidays as demand sank .
since then the firm has restructured its debts , axed around 2,000 jobs , brought in new management and sold off businesses - including its loss making cruise ship fleet and german business .
on the up ?
mr mchugh added that the group had made good progress with restructuring its uk charter and distribution business , and is continuing to cut costs and improve its performance .
" although there is still more to be done , we are ahead of schedule on delivering the cost savings and believe that they are now likely to exceed the target of £ 150m in 2005 , " he said .
but mytravel hailed its achievements in its north american and northern european markets , adding that bookings were encouraging .
in the first half , the northern europe division made an operating profit before one-off costs of £ 5.5m , turning around a £ 25.2m loss from last timer .
meanwhile , in north america operating profits rose to £ 98.5m from £ 2.9m - largely thanks to its canadian business .

kim howells said a chocolate bar " once a week " would not harm anyone .
his comments come after commons leader peter hain described a government-backed scheme devised by chocolate company cadbury as " indefensible " .
under the scheme , launched last year but later dropped , students could exchange chocolate wrappers for sports equipment for their schools .
advertising to get a football net , a total of 5,440 wrappers were required .
ever since monty python 's ministry of funny walks it has been seen as the epitome of the nanny state kim howells on ' walking strategies ' the scheme , which was backed by sports minister richard caborn , was seen to be encouraging children to buy large amounts of chocolate .
mr hain said the decision by the sports minister to support the idea was , in retrospect , wrong .
he said the prevention of childhood obesity demanded a balance between action from the government and parents , and regulation of aggressive advertising .
obesity ' timebomb ' a commons health select committee report , published on thursday , said improving children 's eating habits was the key to tackling an obesity " timebomb " .
mps attacked the government , food industry and advertisers for failing to act to stop rising levels of obesity .
but transport minister kim howells warned the problem should be kept in perspective .
he said he was not personally in favour of initiatives such as the cadbury 's schools scheme , but he said he knew where mr caborn had been coming from .
" a chocolate bar once a week is not going to wreak havoc on anybody 's health , especially if they are taking more exercise , " he told bbc radio 4 's today programme .
" but i think all things in moderation .
