opponents say it is both elitist and barbaric , with a pack of dogs tracking a live animal and then tearing it apart . lords stalled original bill the commons has voted before for a total hunting ban , but opposition in the upper house of lords , rooted deeply in the land-owning aristocracy , stalled legislation long enough for it to die on the order paper . if it is blocked again , prime minister tony blair has vowed to employ the parliament act - a rarely-used law allowing him to override the opinion of the upper house - to overrule the lords and get the ban on the law books . the government has said any ban will not come into effect for two years , though that could be shortened to 18 months to please anti-hunt hardliners within the labor party .
the ban would apply in england and wales , after scotland 's autonomous parliament imposed a similar measure two years ago . fox hunting is one of britain 's most bitter political issues , with a great number of country dwellers in favor of the activity but the majority of parliament and people in general against it . it is a quintessential british country pastime going back many centuries in which noisy packs of hounds chase a fox over rolling countryside , followed by hunters in bright red jackets galloping on horseback .
the fox , if it fails to escape , is eventually cornered , killed and ripped apart by the excited dogs before someone comes with a plastic bag and takes its remains away for disposal . some government officials in favor britain 's vocal animal welfare movement , outraged by the obvious brutality of the sport , have called for a ban for years , and influential members and factions of blair 's own labor party want to see it done away with as well . the pro-hunt camp , on the other hand , has threatened civil disobedience if a ban goes ahead - a tactic that rural affairs minister alun michael called ill-advised .
" the place for anybody who disagrees with the ban on hunting , the place to make their point is not on the streets but through the ballot box , " said michael on bbc radio . " we are being a reasonable , moderate government , saying this issue has to be resolved , we promised to resolve it , and if we can only resolve it by the use of the parliament act , then that will be done . " no widespread ban in europe the ban would bring britain into line with other european countries like belgium , switzerland and germany where hunting with hounds is banned , although in germany it is still legal to use hounds to drive the hunted animal towards a shooting party .
however , hunting with hounds , either on foot or on horseback , remains popular and legal in ireland , the netherlands , portugal , spain , italy and france . the european commission has no common policy on blood sports .
the commission states that " there are no eu laws where animals are linked to national or local traditions and to culture … this includes bull fighting and fox hunting . "
it adds that only wild , migratory birds come under protection at eu level . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love and betrayal in the animal kingdom in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals .

" we have absolutely no plans to join this force , " struck told the german television station wdr on thursday . struck pointed to his country 's wwii history , which he says makes it difficult for germany to create military-style forces responsible for maintaining domestic law and order in other countries . five other countries - france , italy , spain , portugal and the netherlands - have already publicly stated their support for the project .

but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen . take a peek inside the fruit and vegetable store where kahalid saeed aydin works , and it looks like turkey is already part of the european union .
he sells italian grapes and nectarines , spanish oranges and german apples .
in the refrigerated case by the cash register french and turkish sheep cheese soak in brine next to each other , on sale for the same price .
but the inside of the store in the western german city of koblenz is deceptive .
turkey is not part of the eu , but it 's been an official candidate for membership since 1999 .
an independent commission on turkey will report on its findings , which call the beginning of accession talks " politically imperative , " in vienna thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half the products kahalid saeed aydin sells come from turkey though generally not interested in politics , aydin -lrb- photo -rrb- said turkey joining the eu would be good , but would n't have a large effect on his own life , as he is " already in the eu . "
other turks in germany - who total 2.6 million and make up the country 's largest immigrant group - echo his feelings and wonder what concrete changes eu membership would have for them .
" what should change with the eu , " asked ibrahim tasar , the owner of three snack bars in bonn , who has lived in germany since 1992 .
" i have my business ; i can travel ; i work hard .
the eu wo n't change that . "
psychological changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish community is germany 's largest immigrant group observers of the german-turkish community agree that people with turkish roots living in germany will have to keep working hard , but some emotional changes could take place if the european council decides to start accession negotiations with ankara when it meets in december .
" people would have a sense of social recognition similar to that of germans or other minorities in germany - that 's the main motive behind their support , " dirk halm , a spokesman for the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university , told dw-world .
it 's emotional changes , not economic benefits , that most interest mustafa schat , head of the german-turkish economic center in cologne .
" it would change the discussions about turkish people in germany , " he said .
" i could say , ' we europeans . '
it would be clear to everyone that turkey belongs to europe . "
does turkey belong in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a place for a crescent in the europe 's star-filled flag ?
currently , not everyone in the eu agrees on turkey 's place in europe .
eu agriculture commissioner franz fischer has called turkey " much more oriental than european " and campaigned against starting negations with the country .
on the other hand , tasar , the snack bar owner , and the independent commission , affirm turkey is part of europe , with the report describing the country as a society oriented " toward europe and the west . "
already a key member of nato , part of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and playing in europe 's soccer scene , the eu is one of the only european organizations where turkey does not have a seat .
economic changes already happened about 75 percent of turkey 's 70 million people would vote to join the eu , mostly for economic reasons , according to the report .
but there would be few economic benefits for turkish people and businesses that have already put down their roots in germany .
germany has had an import-export deal with turkey since 1996 , which would decrease the economic effects of eu membership since there are n't many trade barriers now , center for studies on turkey spokesman halm said .
" our status as a partner has already brought a positive economic effect , " schat of the german-turkish economic center said .
" many turk-run companies here do n't rely on the turkish market or turkish goods . "
there could , however , be advantages for companies in the service , transport and tourism industries if turkey is admitted to the eu , he added .
reforms are key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion commissioner verheugen thinks 2015 is the earliest turkey could join the eu before any possible negotiations end , making turkey a full eu member , which could happen in 2015 " at the earliest , " according to european expansion commissioner günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , politicians want to be sure ankara is serious about its reforms - which the turkish-german community is also interested in .
members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "
in an effort to show europe it 's ready to begin talks , in the last two years turkey has passed laws increasing freedom of speech and reducing the role of the military , with the latest batch coming two weeks ago .
turkey is counting on receiving a date ; all of their reforms had the goal of getting them ready for the eu , halm said .
he expects the country to receive one from the european council in december .
" i think once turkey is admitted to the eu , people will ask themselves , ' why did n't we do this 10 years ago ? , " ' tasar said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "
the modern-day homesteaders , however , certainly do n't have farming or ranching in mind . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a perfect place for artists a new cultural concept in the western german town of essen offers artists free space and inspiration to work on their projects .

members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "
in an effort to show europe it 's ready to begin talks , in the last two years turkey has passed laws increasing freedom of speech and reducing the role of the military , with the latest batch coming two weeks ago .
turkey is counting on receiving a date ; all of their reforms had the goal of getting them ready for the eu , halm said .
he expects the country to receive one from the european council in december .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.09.2004 foreigners to boost german job training großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : creating training jobs is no head-scratcher for bulmahn some one million jobs in germany are with companies that are not german-owned .
but these firms are less likely to offer much needed training positions for students - an integral part of germany 's education system . germany 's education ministry , the german chamber of commerce and 14 international business associations agreed wednesday on an initiative to raise the number of official training positions offered for young " foreigners " living in germany .
turkish companies on the whole are economically very successful , but have done relatively little by way of creating training jobs , said kemal sahin , president of the german-turkish chamber of commerce .
" -lrb- turkish firms -rrb- have created 350,000 jobs , " he said .
" but for future workers they have n't done much .
their quota of training positions is under 6 percent .
so , there a long way still to go . "
bilingual personnel needed foreign companies are especially in need of bilingual workers who have knowledge of different cultures .
if despite this need they fail to train more workers it is because they do n't know any better , said salvatore condipodaro , who is in charge of an association of italian companies .
" as -lrb- foreign -rrb- businesses , we laid our foundation based on what we brought with us when we came to germany - our own system of training , which was nonexistent , " he said .
" we did n't learn enough about the way things are done here .
that 's why there has n't been more done here so far . "
navigating the system many foreign companies simply do not know about germany 's so-called " dual system , " in which an official , state-sanctioned training position is offered in combination with attendance at a vocational school .
others were either intimidated by the thought of jumping through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to attain the right to a training position , or ausbildungsberechtigung , or else they simply did n't want to bother .
in recent time , the rules pertaining to such training positions have been relaxed .
nonetheless , for many foreign firms , it simply does n't occur to them to offer official training positions .
irina bernstein , a russian businesswoman who works in media and advertising , explained how difficult it is to find qualified bilingual workers .
she finally began offering training positions when she found herself in a dire situation .
" i have to say , it was very easy for us to get the official go-ahead to offer the training positions , " she said .
" the berlin chamber of commerce supported us , which made it really easy .
now we have three training positions , and we get trainees who are studying to work in administrative jobs . "
too little investment in the opinion of german education minister edelgard bulmahn , many more foreign firms should follow bernstein 's example .
the benefit would be that such companies would need to hire " foreign " germans , meaning immigrants or the children of immigrants -lrb- even if the latter may have been born in the country -rrb- .
" foreign " youths generally have a much lower rate of finding training positions .
" i find it extremely unfortunate that such a great percentage of young immigrants are n't trained , " bulmahn said .
" the amount of training we invest in these young people is simply too little .
it is in their own interest to get a training position , but it is also in the interest of our economy to give them a chance to train . "
the education minister strongly supports the initiative of the german-turkish chamber of commerce in its recently announced attempt to create 1,000 new training positions in turkish firms .
especially given its export-oriented economy , germany needs trained multicultural workers , and in the long run , training positions serve to aid integration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's intercultural business climate foreigners starting up businesses in germany need to be prepared to bridge a cultural divide .
making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them .

the study looked at 130 suicide notes left behind by people between 65 and 95 years old from 1995 to 2003 and also found most of the elderly who took their own lives also suffered from depression , dementia or chronic pain .
many older people are worried about the state of germany 's old people 's homes , reinhard linder , who has examined the phenomenon of elderly suicide in his work at the center for suicidal behavior studies in hamburg , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .
however germany will have to struggle to improve or even maintain the quality of its nursing homes .

many older people are worried about the state of germany 's old people 's homes , reinhard linder , who has examined the phenomenon of elderly suicide in his work at the center for suicidal behavior studies in hamburg , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .

" this is the start of a very long journey , which will only be lengthened by the siphoning off of reconstruction funds by corrupt officials , the apparent manipulation of elections , a failure to protect human rights and the absence of dialogue . "
patten also called on the russian government to " put in place a leadership in chechnya in which the population of chechnya has confidence . "
moscow has refused to openly negotiate with chechen leaders , instead talking to general alu alkhanov , the moscow backed candidate who won what many consider to be rigged elections last month .
the commissioner 's comments are his most critical to date and will no doubt receive a cool response in the kremlin .

this year austria had - by the end of august - already received 4,221 applications from russian asylum seekers , making them the largest single group of asylum seekers in the country , according to statistics from the austrian ministry of the interior .

but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen . take a peek inside the fruit and vegetable store where kahalid saeed aydin works , and it looks like turkey is already part of the european union .
he sells italian grapes and nectarines , spanish oranges and german apples .
in the refrigerated case by the cash register french and turkish sheep cheese soak in brine next to each other , on sale for the same price .
but the inside of the store in the western german city of koblenz is deceptive .
turkey is not part of the eu , but it 's been an official candidate for membership since 1999 .
an independent commission on turkey will report on its findings , which call the beginning of accession talks " politically imperative , " in vienna thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half the products kahalid saeed aydin sells come from turkey though generally not interested in politics , aydin -lrb- photo -rrb- said turkey joining the eu would be good , but would n't have a large effect on his own life , as he is " already in the eu . "
other turks in germany - who total 2.6 million and make up the country 's largest immigrant group - echo his feelings and wonder what concrete changes eu membership would have for them .
" what should change with the eu , " asked ibrahim tasar , the owner of three snack bars in bonn , who has lived in germany since 1992 .
" i have my business ; i can travel ; i work hard .
the eu wo n't change that . "
psychological changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish community is germany 's largest immigrant group observers of the german-turkish community agree that people with turkish roots living in germany will have to keep working hard , but some emotional changes could take place if the european council decides to start accession negotiations with ankara when it meets in december .
" people would have a sense of social recognition similar to that of germans or other minorities in germany - that 's the main motive behind their support , " dirk halm , a spokesman for the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university , told dw-world .
it 's emotional changes , not economic benefits , that most interest mustafa schat , head of the german-turkish economic center in cologne .
" it would change the discussions about turkish people in germany , " he said .
" i could say , ' we europeans . '
it would be clear to everyone that turkey belongs to europe . "
does turkey belong in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a place for a crescent in the europe 's star-filled flag ?
currently , not everyone in the eu agrees on turkey 's place in europe .
eu agriculture commissioner franz fischer has called turkey " much more oriental than european " and campaigned against starting negations with the country .
on the other hand , tasar , the snack bar owner , and the independent commission , affirm turkey is part of europe , with the report describing the country as a society oriented " toward europe and the west . "
already a key member of nato , part of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and playing in europe 's soccer scene , the eu is one of the only european organizations where turkey does not have a seat .
economic changes already happened about 75 percent of turkey 's 70 million people would vote to join the eu , mostly for economic reasons , according to the report .
but there would be few economic benefits for turkish people and businesses that have already put down their roots in germany .
germany has had an import-export deal with turkey since 1996 , which would decrease the economic effects of eu membership since there are n't many trade barriers now , center for studies on turkey spokesman halm said .
" our status as a partner has already brought a positive economic effect , " schat of the german-turkish economic center said .
" many turk-run companies here do n't rely on the turkish market or turkish goods . "
there could , however , be advantages for companies in the service , transport and tourism industries if turkey is admitted to the eu , he added .
reforms are key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion commissioner verheugen thinks 2015 is the earliest turkey could join the eu before any possible negotiations end , making turkey a full eu member , which could happen in 2015 " at the earliest , " according to european expansion commissioner günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , politicians want to be sure ankara is serious about its reforms - which the turkish-german community is also interested in .
members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "
in an effort to show europe it 's ready to begin talks , in the last two years turkey has passed laws increasing freedom of speech and reducing the role of the military , with the latest batch coming two weeks ago .
turkey is counting on receiving a date ; all of their reforms had the goal of getting them ready for the eu , halm said .
he expects the country to receive one from the european council in december .
" i think once turkey is admitted to the eu , people will ask themselves , ' why did n't we do this 10 years ago ? , " ' tasar said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

the consequences of failure are imminent : poorly educated students are a burden to the economy while the best and brightest leave for opportunities abroad .

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "

marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "
the modern-day homesteaders , however , certainly do n't have farming or ranching in mind . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a perfect place for artists a new cultural concept in the western german town of essen offers artists free space and inspiration to work on their projects .

but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen . take a peek inside the fruit and vegetable store where kahalid saeed aydin works , and it looks like turkey is already part of the european union .
he sells italian grapes and nectarines , spanish oranges and german apples .
in the refrigerated case by the cash register french and turkish sheep cheese soak in brine next to each other , on sale for the same price .
but the inside of the store in the western german city of koblenz is deceptive .
turkey is not part of the eu , but it 's been an official candidate for membership since 1999 .
an independent commission on turkey will report on its findings , which call the beginning of accession talks " politically imperative , " in vienna thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half the products kahalid saeed aydin sells come from turkey though generally not interested in politics , aydin -lrb- photo -rrb- said turkey joining the eu would be good , but would n't have a large effect on his own life , as he is " already in the eu . "
other turks in germany - who total 2.6 million and make up the country 's largest immigrant group - echo his feelings and wonder what concrete changes eu membership would have for them .
" what should change with the eu , " asked ibrahim tasar , the owner of three snack bars in bonn , who has lived in germany since 1992 .
" i have my business ; i can travel ; i work hard .
the eu wo n't change that . "
psychological changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish community is germany 's largest immigrant group observers of the german-turkish community agree that people with turkish roots living in germany will have to keep working hard , but some emotional changes could take place if the european council decides to start accession negotiations with ankara when it meets in december .
" people would have a sense of social recognition similar to that of germans or other minorities in germany - that 's the main motive behind their support , " dirk halm , a spokesman for the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university , told dw-world .
it 's emotional changes , not economic benefits , that most interest mustafa schat , head of the german-turkish economic center in cologne .
" it would change the discussions about turkish people in germany , " he said .
" i could say , ' we europeans . '
it would be clear to everyone that turkey belongs to europe . "
does turkey belong in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a place for a crescent in the europe 's star-filled flag ?
currently , not everyone in the eu agrees on turkey 's place in europe .
eu agriculture commissioner franz fischer has called turkey " much more oriental than european " and campaigned against starting negations with the country .
on the other hand , tasar , the snack bar owner , and the independent commission , affirm turkey is part of europe , with the report describing the country as a society oriented " toward europe and the west . "
already a key member of nato , part of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and playing in europe 's soccer scene , the eu is one of the only european organizations where turkey does not have a seat .
economic changes already happened about 75 percent of turkey 's 70 million people would vote to join the eu , mostly for economic reasons , according to the report .
but there would be few economic benefits for turkish people and businesses that have already put down their roots in germany .
germany has had an import-export deal with turkey since 1996 , which would decrease the economic effects of eu membership since there are n't many trade barriers now , center for studies on turkey spokesman halm said .
" our status as a partner has already brought a positive economic effect , " schat of the german-turkish economic center said .
" many turk-run companies here do n't rely on the turkish market or turkish goods . "
there could , however , be advantages for companies in the service , transport and tourism industries if turkey is admitted to the eu , he added .
reforms are key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion commissioner verheugen thinks 2015 is the earliest turkey could join the eu before any possible negotiations end , making turkey a full eu member , which could happen in 2015 " at the earliest , " according to european expansion commissioner günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , politicians want to be sure ankara is serious about its reforms - which the turkish-german community is also interested in .
members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "
in an effort to show europe it 's ready to begin talks , in the last two years turkey has passed laws increasing freedom of speech and reducing the role of the military , with the latest batch coming two weeks ago .
turkey is counting on receiving a date ; all of their reforms had the goal of getting them ready for the eu , halm said .
he expects the country to receive one from the european council in december .
" i think once turkey is admitted to the eu , people will ask themselves , ' why did n't we do this 10 years ago ? , " ' tasar said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

today , electricity is 8 percent more expensive than it was before - the most costly in the european union .
a look at the pricing statistics of the energy information center in july 2004 makes it clear : a german household using 3500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year pays € 615 -lrb- $ 748 -rrb- , while in britain the same usage costs € 435 a year .
the finns got off the lightest , with a bill of € 370 .
in terms of europe-wide electricity prices for industrial users , germany came in at second place , behind italy .
and here is no lowering of prices in sight .
rather , the big energy providers , such as eon , vattenfall and rwe , want to increase electricity prices further .
warning : economy threatened this poses a danger to the german economy , said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin .
" energy intensive branches would be especially effected , for example the chemical sector , " she said .
especially now , when the germany economy is looking for an upswing , a price increase would be dubious , said kemfert .
" we hope that the big energy concerns consider the germany 's economic situation , and increase prices less than expected , " she said .
monopoly at fault electricity prices fell immediately following the liberalization of the electricity market four years ago .
but quickly thereafter , market tendencies such as mergers and takeovers in the energy industry led to increased electricity prices , kemfert said .
holger krawinkel , of the berlin consumer protection society said the current monopoly in germany 's energy sector is responsible for the high prices .
one important problem is the monopoly of the electricity grid .
energy producers have to pay high prices to use the grid .
a third of the net electricity cost can be attributed to fees for grid usage - with the usage tending to get more expensive , not less .
debate over regulation starting on jan .
1 , 2005 , the situation is expected to improve .
this past july , the german cabinet passed the energy economic law , establishing a regulatory body for the sector .
similar to the regulatory body for the telecommunication and postal services -lrb- regtp , -rrb- which it will be linked to , the new regulators should make sure there is fair competition on the german energy market .
the new body will differ from regtp in that it will be able to retrospectively control prices if they are shown to be abusive .
rather than celebrating the regulatory body , however , the consumer-advocate krawinkel said it is not a good idea .
" this so-called abuse oversight did n't work in the cartel office , and it is n't used by any other country , " he said .
only when a company is forced to provides in advance paperwork showing price approvals , can you assume they are complete , he added .
" if you want to try to fine the companies after the fact , they will naturally try to talk their way out of it , " krawinkel said .
" in our view , it just wo n't work . "
energy summit expected many german states demand prior examination and approval of electricity prices .
it is therefore questionable whether the regulatory body can actually begin its work at the beginning of the new year , as planned .
there will unquestionably be a gread deal of opposition in the bundesrat , the legislative body that represents the different states ' interests .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants to hold a summit meeting with representatives from the german energy industry , economy minister wolfgang clement , and environment minister jürgen trittin , in order to discuss the announced price increases .

today , electricity is 8 percent more expensive than it was before - the most costly in the european union .
a look at the pricing statistics of the energy information center in july 2004 makes it clear : a german household using 3500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year pays € 615 -lrb- $ 748 -rrb- , while in britain the same usage costs € 435 a year .
the finns got off the lightest , with a bill of € 370 .
in terms of europe-wide electricity prices for industrial users , germany came in at second place , behind italy .
and here is no lowering of prices in sight .
rather , the big energy providers , such as eon , vattenfall and rwe , want to increase electricity prices further .
warning : economy threatened this poses a danger to the german economy , said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin .
" energy intensive branches would be especially effected , for example the chemical sector , " she said .
especially now , when the germany economy is looking for an upswing , a price increase would be dubious , said kemfert .
" we hope that the big energy concerns consider the germany 's economic situation , and increase prices less than expected , " she said .
monopoly at fault electricity prices fell immediately following the liberalization of the electricity market four years ago .
but quickly thereafter , market tendencies such as mergers and takeovers in the energy industry led to increased electricity prices , kemfert said .
holger krawinkel , of the berlin consumer protection society said the current monopoly in germany 's energy sector is responsible for the high prices .
one important problem is the monopoly of the electricity grid .
energy producers have to pay high prices to use the grid .
a third of the net electricity cost can be attributed to fees for grid usage - with the usage tending to get more expensive , not less .
debate over regulation starting on jan .
1 , 2005 , the situation is expected to improve .
this past july , the german cabinet passed the energy economic law , establishing a regulatory body for the sector .
similar to the regulatory body for the telecommunication and postal services -lrb- regtp , -rrb- which it will be linked to , the new regulators should make sure there is fair competition on the german energy market .
the new body will differ from regtp in that it will be able to retrospectively control prices if they are shown to be abusive .
rather than celebrating the regulatory body , however , the consumer-advocate krawinkel said it is not a good idea .
" this so-called abuse oversight did n't work in the cartel office , and it is n't used by any other country , " he said .
only when a company is forced to provides in advance paperwork showing price approvals , can you assume they are complete , he added .
" if you want to try to fine the companies after the fact , they will naturally try to talk their way out of it , " krawinkel said .
" in our view , it just wo n't work . "
energy summit expected many german states demand prior examination and approval of electricity prices .
it is therefore questionable whether the regulatory body can actually begin its work at the beginning of the new year , as planned .
there will unquestionably be a gread deal of opposition in the bundesrat , the legislative body that represents the different states ' interests .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants to hold a summit meeting with representatives from the german energy industry , economy minister wolfgang clement , and environment minister jürgen trittin , in order to discuss the announced price increases .
however , an accord with the energy industry is unlikely , since the industry itself blames the higher prices on the government .
the electricity industry association -lrb- vdew -rrb- blames the situation on taxes and duties of up to 40 percent .
with price increases , the company could react to increased fuel prices and costs for promoting renewable energies , a vdew spokesperson told newspapers . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dung good germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.09.2004 bright lights , big cities , no competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an expensive proposition : germany 's electricity grid germans have to dig deeper in their pockets to turn on lights , do a load of laundry , or heat their homes with electricity , than any other nation in europe . open markets and lower prices were the goals when the german electricity market was liberalized in 1999 .
today , electricity is 8 percent more expensive than it was before - the most costly in the european union .
a look at the pricing statistics of the energy information center in july 2004 makes it clear : a german household using 3500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year pays € 615 -lrb- $ 748 -rrb- , while in britain the same usage costs € 435 a year .
the finns got off the lightest , with a bill of € 370 .
in terms of europe-wide electricity prices for industrial users , germany came in at second place , behind italy .
and here is no lowering of prices in sight .
rather , the big energy providers , such as eon , vattenfall and rwe , want to increase electricity prices further .
warning : economy threatened this poses a danger to the german economy , said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin .
" energy intensive branches would be especially effected , for example the chemical sector , " she said .
especially now , when the germany economy is looking for an upswing , a price increase would be dubious , said kemfert .
" we hope that the big energy concerns consider the germany 's economic situation , and increase prices less than expected , " she said .
monopoly at fault electricity prices fell immediately following the liberalization of the electricity market four years ago .
but quickly thereafter , market tendencies such as mergers and takeovers in the energy industry led to increased electricity prices , kemfert said .
holger krawinkel , of the berlin consumer protection society said the current monopoly in germany 's energy sector is responsible for the high prices .
one important problem is the monopoly of the electricity grid .
energy producers have to pay high prices to use the grid .
a third of the net electricity cost can be attributed to fees for grid usage - with the usage tending to get more expensive , not less .
debate over regulation starting on jan .
1 , 2005 , the situation is expected to improve .
this past july , the german cabinet passed the energy economic law , establishing a regulatory body for the sector .
similar to the regulatory body for the telecommunication and postal services -lrb- regtp , -rrb- which it will be linked to , the new regulators should make sure there is fair competition on the german energy market .

but these firms are less likely to offer much needed training positions for students - an integral part of germany 's education system . germany 's education ministry , the german chamber of commerce and 14 international business associations agreed wednesday on an initiative to raise the number of official training positions offered for young " foreigners " living in germany .
turkish companies on the whole are economically very successful , but have done relatively little by way of creating training jobs , said kemal sahin , president of the german-turkish chamber of commerce .
" -lrb- turkish firms -rrb- have created 350,000 jobs , " he said .
" but for future workers they have n't done much .
their quota of training positions is under 6 percent .
so , there a long way still to go . "
bilingual personnel needed foreign companies are especially in need of bilingual workers who have knowledge of different cultures .
if despite this need they fail to train more workers it is because they do n't know any better , said salvatore condipodaro , who is in charge of an association of italian companies .
" as -lrb- foreign -rrb- businesses , we laid our foundation based on what we brought with us when we came to germany - our own system of training , which was nonexistent , " he said .
" we did n't learn enough about the way things are done here .
that 's why there has n't been more done here so far . "
navigating the system many foreign companies simply do not know about germany 's so-called " dual system , " in which an official , state-sanctioned training position is offered in combination with attendance at a vocational school .
others were either intimidated by the thought of jumping through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to attain the right to a training position , or ausbildungsberechtigung , or else they simply did n't want to bother .
in recent time , the rules pertaining to such training positions have been relaxed .
nonetheless , for many foreign firms , it simply does n't occur to them to offer official training positions .
irina bernstein , a russian businesswoman who works in media and advertising , explained how difficult it is to find qualified bilingual workers .
she finally began offering training positions when she found herself in a dire situation .
" i have to say , it was very easy for us to get the official go-ahead to offer the training positions , " she said .
" the berlin chamber of commerce supported us , which made it really easy .
now we have three training positions , and we get trainees who are studying to work in administrative jobs . "
too little investment in the opinion of german education minister edelgard bulmahn , many more foreign firms should follow bernstein 's example .
the benefit would be that such companies would need to hire " foreign " germans , meaning immigrants or the children of immigrants -lrb- even if the latter may have been born in the country -rrb- .
" foreign " youths generally have a much lower rate of finding training positions .
" i find it extremely unfortunate that such a great percentage of young immigrants are n't trained , " bulmahn said .
" the amount of training we invest in these young people is simply too little .
it is in their own interest to get a training position , but it is also in the interest of our economy to give them a chance to train . "
the education minister strongly supports the initiative of the german-turkish chamber of commerce in its recently announced attempt to create 1,000 new training positions in turkish firms .

but these firms are less likely to offer much needed training positions for students - an integral part of germany 's education system . germany 's education ministry , the german chamber of commerce and 14 international business associations agreed wednesday on an initiative to raise the number of official training positions offered for young " foreigners " living in germany .
turkish companies on the whole are economically very successful , but have done relatively little by way of creating training jobs , said kemal sahin , president of the german-turkish chamber of commerce .
" -lrb- turkish firms -rrb- have created 350,000 jobs , " he said .
" but for future workers they have n't done much .
their quota of training positions is under 6 percent .
so , there a long way still to go . "
bilingual personnel needed foreign companies are especially in need of bilingual workers who have knowledge of different cultures .
if despite this need they fail to train more workers it is because they do n't know any better , said salvatore condipodaro , who is in charge of an association of italian companies .
" as -lrb- foreign -rrb- businesses , we laid our foundation based on what we brought with us when we came to germany - our own system of training , which was nonexistent , " he said .
" we did n't learn enough about the way things are done here .
that 's why there has n't been more done here so far . "
navigating the system many foreign companies simply do not know about germany 's so-called " dual system , " in which an official , state-sanctioned training position is offered in combination with attendance at a vocational school .

in recent time , the rules pertaining to such training positions have been relaxed .
nonetheless , for many foreign firms , it simply does n't occur to them to offer official training positions .
irina bernstein , a russian businesswoman who works in media and advertising , explained how difficult it is to find qualified bilingual workers .
she finally began offering training positions when she found herself in a dire situation .
" i have to say , it was very easy for us to get the official go-ahead to offer the training positions , " she said .
" the berlin chamber of commerce supported us , which made it really easy .
now we have three training positions , and we get trainees who are studying to work in administrative jobs . "
too little investment in the opinion of german education minister edelgard bulmahn , many more foreign firms should follow bernstein 's example .
the benefit would be that such companies would need to hire " foreign " germans , meaning immigrants or the children of immigrants -lrb- even if the latter may have been born in the country -rrb- .
" foreign " youths generally have a much lower rate of finding training positions .
" i find it extremely unfortunate that such a great percentage of young immigrants are n't trained , " bulmahn said .
" the amount of training we invest in these young people is simply too little .
it is in their own interest to get a training position , but it is also in the interest of our economy to give them a chance to train . "
the education minister strongly supports the initiative of the german-turkish chamber of commerce in its recently announced attempt to create 1,000 new training positions in turkish firms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bratwurst and burgers german-americans : more than bratwurst & beer " fahrenheit 9/11 " set to heat up germany one year later , germany anything but smug over iraq war us investors still like germany culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.09.2004 lone star krauts remake texas town großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of germans are clearing away the tumbleweeds in lobo a handful of germans have purchased an abandoned town in texas .
not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .

an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.09.2004 back to domestic bundesliga business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart return from uefa cup duty in hungary to defend top spot the glitz and glamour of european competition makes way for domestic duties once more as germany 's represenatatives buckle down to the important business of winning the bundesliga .
here 's how week five shapes up . some bundesliga teams will return to action in week five fresh - and some not so fresh - from combative european competition in mid-week .
after the highs and lows of their champions league and uefa cup performances against teams like real madrid and inter milan , the german representatives will have to knuckle down once more for the domestic struggle for supremacy . after a trip to israel for their opening group stage game , the victorious players of bayern munich take the shorter journey to dortmund to take on bvb .
borussia dortmund were unlucky to lose a lead and eventually draw with bochum last weekend and will hope to keep their concentration against one of their biggest rivals when the bavarians arrive on saturday . bayern 's 1-0 win in the champions league may have restored a little stability and faith in a side teetering on the edge of an early season internal meltdown and if all the elements of their star-studded team are all pulling in the same direction , dortmund may have their hands full . buzzing bayer back to earth bayer leverkusen may still be on cloud nine by the time nuremberg come calling this weekend after dispatching the widely recognized " best team in the world " in their 3-0 european mid-week romp .
real madrid felt the cutting edge of klaus augenthaler 's rapier team and after losing an unbeaten 14 game streak to fsv mainz in week four , leverkusen will want to keep the momentum of wednesday night 's stunning win going in their domestic campaign . ninth place nuremberg floundered in the dullest game of the season so far last week , the 0-0 draw with an equally uninspiring berlin , and may not fancy dealing with a buoyant bayer .
however , nuremberg have had their moments this season and are not incapable of adding a second league defeat in a row to leverkusen . leverkusen 's conquerors mainz face arminia bielefeld away on saturday , looking down on their bottom of the league opponents from the lofty position of fourth spot .
both teams were promoted last season but things are now very different from how they were in the second bundesliga .
mainz , in their first ever season , are relishing their top flight soccer and have put in some great performances .
in-form mainz striker benni auer will be one bielefeld will have to watch as the home side attempt to keep the score down and chase some well needed points which could keep their solitary one company . stuttering champs need to settle nerves just above bottom placed bielefeld sit hanover 96 , visitors to stuttering champions werder bremen on saturday .
hanover are struggling at this early stage of the season and may be in two minds about the best course of action ahead of the weekend 's journey to bremen .
the champions are presenting a very schizophrenic image so far . hanover could struggle against the cavalier bremen team who are more than capable of turning over any team in the league on their day , or they could stand a decent chance of victory against the nervous werder side which has slipped to two consecutive league defeats and one loss in europe in the past three weeks . another team facing a crisis of confidence is schalke 04 who play host to borussia mönchengladbach at the weekend .
after waving goodbye to jupp heynckes , the manager-less and free-falling gelsenkirchen side will face mönchengladbach , werder bremen 's victors from week four , after an unpredictable visit to latvia in the uefa cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's marek heinz , celebrates after scroring against werder bremen .
mönchengladbach in tenth are on the up after languishing in the bottom section of the league for the first three weeks of the campaign , more than doubling their points total with last week 's win over the champions .
they could heap more misery on the rudderless royal blues as schalke 's season looks likely to get worse before it gets better . relegation-zone dog fights begin already kaiserslautern are hoping that their worst is over and that things are now getting better after recording their first points of the season last week with the 3-2 away win against hansa rostock .
the much-needed three points lifted kaiserslautern off the bottom of the league and up to a decidedly less dodgy 14th . on the way out of the relegation zone , they passed hamburg , their visitors on saturday , going in the opposite direction .
klaus toppmöller 's side had just managed to get themselves off the foot of the table a week before , passing the unenviable position to kaiserslautern , before losing to stuttgart in week four .
both teams are on shaky ground and the game could go either way with neither safely away from the drop zone . the team just above both kaiserslautern and hamburg is hansa rostock who entertain one of the form teams at the moment , vfl wolfsburg .
wolfsburg have back-to-back wins over werder bremen and schalke 04 to keep the confidence flowing and will be looking for a third consecutive win to keep the pressure on stuttgart at the top of the league .
hansa were unlucky to lose last week but will be fortunate to avoid a second defeat against second placed wolfsburg if thomas brdaric and co. are on fire once again . no daylight between bochum and freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum tried everything to get a result against dortmund but finsihed with a draw .
sc freiburg and vfl bochum meet on sunday with almost identical records to date .

here 's how week five shapes up . some bundesliga teams will return to action in week five fresh - and some not so fresh - from combative european competition in mid-week .
after the highs and lows of their champions league and uefa cup performances against teams like real madrid and inter milan , the german representatives will have to knuckle down once more for the domestic struggle for supremacy . after a trip to israel for their opening group stage game , the victorious players of bayern munich take the shorter journey to dortmund to take on bvb .
borussia dortmund were unlucky to lose a lead and eventually draw with bochum last weekend and will hope to keep their concentration against one of their biggest rivals when the bavarians arrive on saturday . bayern 's 1-0 win in the champions league may have restored a little stability and faith in a side teetering on the edge of an early season internal meltdown and if all the elements of their star-studded team are all pulling in the same direction , dortmund may have their hands full . buzzing bayer back to earth bayer leverkusen may still be on cloud nine by the time nuremberg come calling this weekend after dispatching the widely recognized " best team in the world " in their 3-0 european mid-week romp .
real madrid felt the cutting edge of klaus augenthaler 's rapier team and after losing an unbeaten 14 game streak to fsv mainz in week four , leverkusen will want to keep the momentum of wednesday night 's stunning win going in their domestic campaign . ninth place nuremberg floundered in the dullest game of the season so far last week , the 0-0 draw with an equally uninspiring berlin , and may not fancy dealing with a buoyant bayer .
however , nuremberg have had their moments this season and are not incapable of adding a second league defeat in a row to leverkusen . leverkusen 's conquerors mainz face arminia bielefeld away on saturday , looking down on their bottom of the league opponents from the lofty position of fourth spot .
both teams were promoted last season but things are now very different from how they were in the second bundesliga .
mainz , in their first ever season , are relishing their top flight soccer and have put in some great performances .
in-form mainz striker benni auer will be one bielefeld will have to watch as the home side attempt to keep the score down and chase some well needed points which could keep their solitary one company . stuttering champs need to settle nerves just above bottom placed bielefeld sit hanover 96 , visitors to stuttering champions werder bremen on saturday .
hanover are struggling at this early stage of the season and may be in two minds about the best course of action ahead of the weekend 's journey to bremen .
the champions are presenting a very schizophrenic image so far . hanover could struggle against the cavalier bremen team who are more than capable of turning over any team in the league on their day , or they could stand a decent chance of victory against the nervous werder side which has slipped to two consecutive league defeats and one loss in europe in the past three weeks . another team facing a crisis of confidence is schalke 04 who play host to borussia mönchengladbach at the weekend .
after waving goodbye to jupp heynckes , the manager-less and free-falling gelsenkirchen side will face mönchengladbach , werder bremen 's victors from week four , after an unpredictable visit to latvia in the uefa cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's marek heinz , celebrates after scroring against werder bremen .
mönchengladbach in tenth are on the up after languishing in the bottom section of the league for the first three weeks of the campaign , more than doubling their points total with last week 's win over the champions .
they could heap more misery on the rudderless royal blues as schalke 's season looks likely to get worse before it gets better . relegation-zone dog fights begin already kaiserslautern are hoping that their worst is over and that things are now getting better after recording their first points of the season last week with the 3-2 away win against hansa rostock .
the much-needed three points lifted kaiserslautern off the bottom of the league and up to a decidedly less dodgy 14th . on the way out of the relegation zone , they passed hamburg , their visitors on saturday , going in the opposite direction .
klaus toppmöller 's side had just managed to get themselves off the foot of the table a week before , passing the unenviable position to kaiserslautern , before losing to stuttgart in week four .
both teams are on shaky ground and the game could go either way with neither safely away from the drop zone . the team just above both kaiserslautern and hamburg is hansa rostock who entertain one of the form teams at the moment , vfl wolfsburg .
wolfsburg have back-to-back wins over werder bremen and schalke 04 to keep the confidence flowing and will be looking for a third consecutive win to keep the pressure on stuttgart at the top of the league .
hansa were unlucky to lose last week but will be fortunate to avoid a second defeat against second placed wolfsburg if thomas brdaric and co. are on fire once again . no daylight between bochum and freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum tried everything to get a result against dortmund but finsihed with a draw .
sc freiburg and vfl bochum meet on sunday with almost identical records to date .

after waving goodbye to jupp heynckes , the manager-less and free-falling gelsenkirchen side will face mönchengladbach , werder bremen 's victors from week four , after an unpredictable visit to latvia in the uefa cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's marek heinz , celebrates after scroring against werder bremen .
mönchengladbach in tenth are on the up after languishing in the bottom section of the league for the first three weeks of the campaign , more than doubling their points total with last week 's win over the champions .
they could heap more misery on the rudderless royal blues as schalke 's season looks likely to get worse before it gets better . relegation-zone dog fights begin already kaiserslautern are hoping that their worst is over and that things are now getting better after recording their first points of the season last week with the 3-2 away win against hansa rostock .
the much-needed three points lifted kaiserslautern off the bottom of the league and up to a decidedly less dodgy 14th . on the way out of the relegation zone , they passed hamburg , their visitors on saturday , going in the opposite direction .
klaus toppmöller 's side had just managed to get themselves off the foot of the table a week before , passing the unenviable position to kaiserslautern , before losing to stuttgart in week four .
both teams are on shaky ground and the game could go either way with neither safely away from the drop zone . the team just above both kaiserslautern and hamburg is hansa rostock who entertain one of the form teams at the moment , vfl wolfsburg .
wolfsburg have back-to-back wins over werder bremen and schalke 04 to keep the confidence flowing and will be looking for a third consecutive win to keep the pressure on stuttgart at the top of the league .
hansa were unlucky to lose last week but will be fortunate to avoid a second defeat against second placed wolfsburg if thomas brdaric and co. are on fire once again . no daylight between bochum and freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum tried everything to get a result against dortmund but finsihed with a draw .

bochum in seventh scraped a 2-2 draw from their ruhr valley derby with borussia dortmund last week to remain equal on points and goal difference with eighth placed freiburg , who also drew 2-2 with hanover .

here 's how week five shapes up . some bundesliga teams will return to action in week five fresh - and some not so fresh - from combative european competition in mid-week .
after the highs and lows of their champions league and uefa cup performances against teams like real madrid and inter milan , the german representatives will have to knuckle down once more for the domestic struggle for supremacy . after a trip to israel for their opening group stage game , the victorious players of bayern munich take the shorter journey to dortmund to take on bvb .
borussia dortmund were unlucky to lose a lead and eventually draw with bochum last weekend and will hope to keep their concentration against one of their biggest rivals when the bavarians arrive on saturday . bayern 's 1-0 win in the champions league may have restored a little stability and faith in a side teetering on the edge of an early season internal meltdown and if all the elements of their star-studded team are all pulling in the same direction , dortmund may have their hands full . buzzing bayer back to earth bayer leverkusen may still be on cloud nine by the time nuremberg come calling this weekend after dispatching the widely recognized " best team in the world " in their 3-0 european mid-week romp .
real madrid felt the cutting edge of klaus augenthaler 's rapier team and after losing an unbeaten 14 game streak to fsv mainz in week four , leverkusen will want to keep the momentum of wednesday night 's stunning win going in their domestic campaign . ninth place nuremberg floundered in the dullest game of the season so far last week , the 0-0 draw with an equally uninspiring berlin , and may not fancy dealing with a buoyant bayer .
however , nuremberg have had their moments this season and are not incapable of adding a second league defeat in a row to leverkusen . leverkusen 's conquerors mainz face arminia bielefeld away on saturday , looking down on their bottom of the league opponents from the lofty position of fourth spot .
both teams were promoted last season but things are now very different from how they were in the second bundesliga .
mainz , in their first ever season , are relishing their top flight soccer and have put in some great performances .

here 's how week five shapes up . some bundesliga teams will return to action in week five fresh - and some not so fresh - from combative european competition in mid-week .
after the highs and lows of their champions league and uefa cup performances against teams like real madrid and inter milan , the german representatives will have to knuckle down once more for the domestic struggle for supremacy . after a trip to israel for their opening group stage game , the victorious players of bayern munich take the shorter journey to dortmund to take on bvb .
borussia dortmund were unlucky to lose a lead and eventually draw with bochum last weekend and will hope to keep their concentration against one of their biggest rivals when the bavarians arrive on saturday . bayern 's 1-0 win in the champions league may have restored a little stability and faith in a side teetering on the edge of an early season internal meltdown and if all the elements of their star-studded team are all pulling in the same direction , dortmund may have their hands full . buzzing bayer back to earth bayer leverkusen may still be on cloud nine by the time nuremberg come calling this weekend after dispatching the widely recognized " best team in the world " in their 3-0 european mid-week romp .
real madrid felt the cutting edge of klaus augenthaler 's rapier team and after losing an unbeaten 14 game streak to fsv mainz in week four , leverkusen will want to keep the momentum of wednesday night 's stunning win going in their domestic campaign . ninth place nuremberg floundered in the dullest game of the season so far last week , the 0-0 draw with an equally uninspiring berlin , and may not fancy dealing with a buoyant bayer .
however , nuremberg have had their moments this season and are not incapable of adding a second league defeat in a row to leverkusen . leverkusen 's conquerors mainz face arminia bielefeld away on saturday , looking down on their bottom of the league opponents from the lofty position of fourth spot .
both teams were promoted last season but things are now very different from how they were in the second bundesliga .
mainz , in their first ever season , are relishing their top flight soccer and have put in some great performances .
in-form mainz striker benni auer will be one bielefeld will have to watch as the home side attempt to keep the score down and chase some well needed points which could keep their solitary one company . stuttering champs need to settle nerves just above bottom placed bielefeld sit hanover 96 , visitors to stuttering champions werder bremen on saturday .
hanover are struggling at this early stage of the season and may be in two minds about the best course of action ahead of the weekend 's journey to bremen .
the champions are presenting a very schizophrenic image so far . hanover could struggle against the cavalier bremen team who are more than capable of turning over any team in the league on their day , or they could stand a decent chance of victory against the nervous werder side which has slipped to two consecutive league defeats and one loss in europe in the past three weeks . another team facing a crisis of confidence is schalke 04 who play host to borussia mönchengladbach at the weekend .
after waving goodbye to jupp heynckes , the manager-less and free-falling gelsenkirchen side will face mönchengladbach , werder bremen 's victors from week four , after an unpredictable visit to latvia in the uefa cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's marek heinz , celebrates after scroring against werder bremen .
mönchengladbach in tenth are on the up after languishing in the bottom section of the league for the first three weeks of the campaign , more than doubling their points total with last week 's win over the champions .
they could heap more misery on the rudderless royal blues as schalke 's season looks likely to get worse before it gets better . relegation-zone dog fights begin already kaiserslautern are hoping that their worst is over and that things are now getting better after recording their first points of the season last week with the 3-2 away win against hansa rostock .
the much-needed three points lifted kaiserslautern off the bottom of the league and up to a decidedly less dodgy 14th . on the way out of the relegation zone , they passed hamburg , their visitors on saturday , going in the opposite direction .
klaus toppmöller 's side had just managed to get themselves off the foot of the table a week before , passing the unenviable position to kaiserslautern , before losing to stuttgart in week four .
both teams are on shaky ground and the game could go either way with neither safely away from the drop zone . the team just above both kaiserslautern and hamburg is hansa rostock who entertain one of the form teams at the moment , vfl wolfsburg .
wolfsburg have back-to-back wins over werder bremen and schalke 04 to keep the confidence flowing and will be looking for a third consecutive win to keep the pressure on stuttgart at the top of the league .
hansa were unlucky to lose last week but will be fortunate to avoid a second defeat against second placed wolfsburg if thomas brdaric and co. are on fire once again . no daylight between bochum and freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum tried everything to get a result against dortmund but finsihed with a draw .
sc freiburg and vfl bochum meet on sunday with almost identical records to date .
bochum in seventh scraped a 2-2 draw from their ruhr valley derby with borussia dortmund last week to remain equal on points and goal difference with eighth placed freiburg , who also drew 2-2 with hanover .
there may be little to separate the teams on the day but bochum 's uefa cup clash with standard liege in belgium on thursday night may work in freiburg 's favour . the other match on sunday sees current league leaders vfb stuttgart travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin .
stuttgart have shown irrepressible form at times so far this season and are value for money for their pole position . berlin , however , have ground out results with little invention and need to find a spark from somewhere to prevent their season turning into a painfully slow slog to further mediocrity .
the berliners have the talent but a question mark remains over their desire .
stuttgart , on the other hand , look hungry in their bid for a first title since 1992 . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de all change in bundesliga title race week four threw up some surprising results over the weekend as current high-flyers had their wings clipped and new faces staked their claims in a title race that , although barely a month old , is already wide open .

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bratwurst and burgers german-americans : more than bratwurst & beer " fahrenheit 9/11 " set to heat up germany one year later , germany anything but smug over iraq war us investors still like germany culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.09.2004 lone star krauts remake texas town großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of germans are clearing away the tumbleweeds in lobo a handful of germans have purchased an abandoned town in texas .
not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "
the modern-day homesteaders , however , certainly do n't have farming or ranching in mind . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a perfect place for artists a new cultural concept in the western german town of essen offers artists free space and inspiration to work on their projects .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.09.2004 britain votes on fox hunting ban amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kill bill : fox hunters want to see the law abandoned for good the british house of commons was poised wednesday to ram through a ban on fox hunting in england and wales , against the backdrop of angry protests from thousands of hunt supporters outside parliament . up to 10,000 protesters descended on parliament square at around noon while lawmakers inside the commons debated and voted on legislation to ban the blood sport with a late afternoon conclusion likely to swing in favor of a bill banning fox hunting . the issue has been simmering since the labor party took power in 1997 , and came to a boil in september last year when more than 400,000 hunt supporters bore down on london for an unprecedented march . supporters insist the practice is an inalienable right and a rural tradition which helps control countryside pests and provides thousands of jobs .
opponents say it is both elitist and barbaric , with a pack of dogs tracking a live animal and then tearing it apart . lords stalled original bill the commons has voted before for a total hunting ban , but opposition in the upper house of lords , rooted deeply in the land-owning aristocracy , stalled legislation long enough for it to die on the order paper . if it is blocked again , prime minister tony blair has vowed to employ the parliament act - a rarely-used law allowing him to override the opinion of the upper house - to overrule the lords and get the ban on the law books . the government has said any ban will not come into effect for two years , though that could be shortened to 18 months to please anti-hunt hardliners within the labor party .
the ban would apply in england and wales , after scotland 's autonomous parliament imposed a similar measure two years ago . fox hunting is one of britain 's most bitter political issues , with a great number of country dwellers in favor of the activity but the majority of parliament and people in general against it . it is a quintessential british country pastime going back many centuries in which noisy packs of hounds chase a fox over rolling countryside , followed by hunters in bright red jackets galloping on horseback .
the fox , if it fails to escape , is eventually cornered , killed and ripped apart by the excited dogs before someone comes with a plastic bag and takes its remains away for disposal . some government officials in favor britain 's vocal animal welfare movement , outraged by the obvious brutality of the sport , have called for a ban for years , and influential members and factions of blair 's own labor party want to see it done away with as well . the pro-hunt camp , on the other hand , has threatened civil disobedience if a ban goes ahead - a tactic that rural affairs minister alun michael called ill-advised .
" the place for anybody who disagrees with the ban on hunting , the place to make their point is not on the streets but through the ballot box , " said michael on bbc radio . " we are being a reasonable , moderate government , saying this issue has to be resolved , we promised to resolve it , and if we can only resolve it by the use of the parliament act , then that will be done . " no widespread ban in europe the ban would bring britain into line with other european countries like belgium , switzerland and germany where hunting with hounds is banned , although in germany it is still legal to use hounds to drive the hunted animal towards a shooting party .
however , hunting with hounds , either on foot or on horseback , remains popular and legal in ireland , the netherlands , portugal , spain , italy and france . the european commission has no common policy on blood sports .
the commission states that " there are no eu laws where animals are linked to national or local traditions and to culture … this includes bull fighting and fox hunting . "
it adds that only wild , migratory birds come under protection at eu level . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love and betrayal in the animal kingdom in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals .

opponents say it is both elitist and barbaric , with a pack of dogs tracking a live animal and then tearing it apart . lords stalled original bill the commons has voted before for a total hunting ban , but opposition in the upper house of lords , rooted deeply in the land-owning aristocracy , stalled legislation long enough for it to die on the order paper . if it is blocked again , prime minister tony blair has vowed to employ the parliament act - a rarely-used law allowing him to override the opinion of the upper house - to overrule the lords and get the ban on the law books . the government has said any ban will not come into effect for two years , though that could be shortened to 18 months to please anti-hunt hardliners within the labor party .
the ban would apply in england and wales , after scotland 's autonomous parliament imposed a similar measure two years ago . fox hunting is one of britain 's most bitter political issues , with a great number of country dwellers in favor of the activity but the majority of parliament and people in general against it . it is a quintessential british country pastime going back many centuries in which noisy packs of hounds chase a fox over rolling countryside , followed by hunters in bright red jackets galloping on horseback .
the fox , if it fails to escape , is eventually cornered , killed and ripped apart by the excited dogs before someone comes with a plastic bag and takes its remains away for disposal . some government officials in favor britain 's vocal animal welfare movement , outraged by the obvious brutality of the sport , have called for a ban for years , and influential members and factions of blair 's own labor party want to see it done away with as well . the pro-hunt camp , on the other hand , has threatened civil disobedience if a ban goes ahead - a tactic that rural affairs minister alun michael called ill-advised .
" the place for anybody who disagrees with the ban on hunting , the place to make their point is not on the streets but through the ballot box , " said michael on bbc radio . " we are being a reasonable , moderate government , saying this issue has to be resolved , we promised to resolve it , and if we can only resolve it by the use of the parliament act , then that will be done . " no widespread ban in europe the ban would bring britain into line with other european countries like belgium , switzerland and germany where hunting with hounds is banned , although in germany it is still legal to use hounds to drive the hunted animal towards a shooting party .
however , hunting with hounds , either on foot or on horseback , remains popular and legal in ireland , the netherlands , portugal , spain , italy and france . the european commission has no common policy on blood sports .

german defense minister struck says his country wo n't contribute . increasingly , the european union has been called upon to help with peacekeeping and law enforcement in post-conflict regions like the balkans .
in december , nato will hand over command of the 7,000 strong peacekeeping force in bosnia to the eu . to help handle such undertakings , eu defense ministers - meeting in the dutch seaside resort town on friday - will announce the creation of a paramilitary force modeled on the french gendarmes or the italian carabinieri . unlike rapid reaction forces , which the eu is still in the process of putting together , the proposed gendarmes will not see active duty in conflict zones like iraq .
instead , they 'll concentrate on imposing law and order in post-conflict zones . germany not to participate german defense minister peter struck , who will also attend friday 's meeting , said his country would not contribute to the force .
" we have absolutely no plans to join this force , " struck told the german television station wdr on thursday . struck pointed to his country 's wwii history , which he says makes it difficult for germany to create military-style forces responsible for maintaining domestic law and order in other countries . five other countries - france , italy , spain , portugal and the netherlands - have already publicly stated their support for the project .
in addition to germany , poland and belgium have not agreed to contribute troops .
still , both have reserved the right to participate at a later date . yet another eu defense plan the plan calls for the creation of an 800-strong force that can be deployed within 30 days by 2005 .
the idea was initially proposed last september by french defense minister michele alliot-marie , who said europe needed a better organized force to deal with post-conflict security . " in all crises one notices that the purely military phase is systematically followed by a civilian-military phase , where the aspect of maintaining order becomes increasingly important , " said alliot-marie .
she , no doubt , has been paying attention to the situation in iraq . the gendarme force is the latest in a series initiatives related to eu defense matters .

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "

but these firms are less likely to offer much needed training positions for students - an integral part of germany 's education system . germany 's education ministry , the german chamber of commerce and 14 international business associations agreed wednesday on an initiative to raise the number of official training positions offered for young " foreigners " living in germany .
turkish companies on the whole are economically very successful , but have done relatively little by way of creating training jobs , said kemal sahin , president of the german-turkish chamber of commerce .
" -lrb- turkish firms -rrb- have created 350,000 jobs , " he said .
" but for future workers they have n't done much .
their quota of training positions is under 6 percent .
so , there a long way still to go . "
bilingual personnel needed foreign companies are especially in need of bilingual workers who have knowledge of different cultures .
if despite this need they fail to train more workers it is because they do n't know any better , said salvatore condipodaro , who is in charge of an association of italian companies .
" as -lrb- foreign -rrb- businesses , we laid our foundation based on what we brought with us when we came to germany - our own system of training , which was nonexistent , " he said .
" we did n't learn enough about the way things are done here .
that 's why there has n't been more done here so far . "
navigating the system many foreign companies simply do not know about germany 's so-called " dual system , " in which an official , state-sanctioned training position is offered in combination with attendance at a vocational school .
others were either intimidated by the thought of jumping through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to attain the right to a training position , or ausbildungsberechtigung , or else they simply did n't want to bother .
in recent time , the rules pertaining to such training positions have been relaxed .
nonetheless , for many foreign firms , it simply does n't occur to them to offer official training positions .
irina bernstein , a russian businesswoman who works in media and advertising , explained how difficult it is to find qualified bilingual workers .
she finally began offering training positions when she found herself in a dire situation .
" i have to say , it was very easy for us to get the official go-ahead to offer the training positions , " she said .
" the berlin chamber of commerce supported us , which made it really easy .
now we have three training positions , and we get trainees who are studying to work in administrative jobs . "
too little investment in the opinion of german education minister edelgard bulmahn , many more foreign firms should follow bernstein 's example .
the benefit would be that such companies would need to hire " foreign " germans , meaning immigrants or the children of immigrants -lrb- even if the latter may have been born in the country -rrb- .
" foreign " youths generally have a much lower rate of finding training positions .
" i find it extremely unfortunate that such a great percentage of young immigrants are n't trained , " bulmahn said .
" the amount of training we invest in these young people is simply too little .
it is in their own interest to get a training position , but it is also in the interest of our economy to give them a chance to train . "
the education minister strongly supports the initiative of the german-turkish chamber of commerce in its recently announced attempt to create 1,000 new training positions in turkish firms .
especially given its export-oriented economy , germany needs trained multicultural workers , and in the long run , training positions serve to aid integration . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's intercultural business climate foreigners starting up businesses in germany need to be prepared to bridge a cultural divide .
making the adjustment can be tough , but entrepreneurs from abroad can gain as much from germany as the country does from them .

german defense minister struck says his country wo n't contribute . increasingly , the european union has been called upon to help with peacekeeping and law enforcement in post-conflict regions like the balkans .
in december , nato will hand over command of the 7,000 strong peacekeeping force in bosnia to the eu . to help handle such undertakings , eu defense ministers - meeting in the dutch seaside resort town on friday - will announce the creation of a paramilitary force modeled on the french gendarmes or the italian carabinieri . unlike rapid reaction forces , which the eu is still in the process of putting together , the proposed gendarmes will not see active duty in conflict zones like iraq .
instead , they 'll concentrate on imposing law and order in post-conflict zones . germany not to participate german defense minister peter struck , who will also attend friday 's meeting , said his country would not contribute to the force .
" we have absolutely no plans to join this force , " struck told the german television station wdr on thursday . struck pointed to his country 's wwii history , which he says makes it difficult for germany to create military-style forces responsible for maintaining domestic law and order in other countries . five other countries - france , italy , spain , portugal and the netherlands - have already publicly stated their support for the project .

still , both have reserved the right to participate at a later date . yet another eu defense plan the plan calls for the creation of an 800-strong force that can be deployed within 30 days by 2005 .

each september , the german mountaineering and hiking association sponsors a national hiking day , which serves as an annual reunion for german hiking aficionados and gives members in the country 's many local clubs a chance to get together at one big event . the mountaineering and hiking association is charged with grooming and marking some 190,000 kilometers -lrb- 118,000 miles -rrb- of trails , many of which traverse mountainous landscapes .
the association can also provide information on the many hütten , or huts , that lie along the trails and provide shelter for hikers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grab a friend and go explore there are 78 officially designated trails and trail networks that the association has recognized , but four main hiking regions stand out as germany 's most popular and most impressive .
-lrb- americans could compare these to hiking the appalachian or rocky mountain trails , while brits could keep the peak district or the scottish highlands in mind . -rrb- as the crisp autumn weather begins in germany , now may be the time to embark on one of the following trails : maximiliansweg and the bavarian forest first of the four is the maximiliansweg , which follows the route in the bavarian alps that king maximilian ii took when he crossed the mountain range in the company of a large entourage -lrb- which included writers to document the tour -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking is for any age the route goes from the allgäu region to lake königsee , and takes about 14 days .
the strenuous trip encompasses some of the country 's most famous peaks , beautiful alpine landscapes and views of the bavarian alps . the second route leads through the bavarian forest , between the danube and the czech and austrian borders .
known as europe 's green roof , the bavarian forest is central europe 's largest closed woodland area .
the region once housed more than 60 glass works , a handful of which still exist today , and the " gläserner steig " -lrb- glass ascent -rrb- trail takes hikers right through this region - which leads past glass works and traditional manufacturing villages - in a walk that takes about six days . black forest and sauerland the network of hiking trails in the black forest consists of more than 23,000 kilometers of signposted hiking trails which criss-cross the most beautiful areas of the region .
the most famous of these are the 16 long-distance hiking routes on the " westweg " route . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beech trees in sauerland the route crosses the european watershed , between the rhine and danube rivers .
this part of the trail offers superb views across the deep valleys of the western black forest and the flat high-lying valleys in the east . finally , the rothaarsteig in the eastern sauerland low-mountain region -lrb- the highest peak is some 840 meters in altitude -rrb- is less touristy and offers more nature and less culture than the others .
the path that leads through the area is rough and sometimes a bit wild . crystal clear waters flow , having been filtered by numerous layers of slate , originating from the rivers ruhr , eder , lenne , dill , lahn and sieg .

opponents say it is both elitist and barbaric , with a pack of dogs tracking a live animal and then tearing it apart . lords stalled original bill the commons has voted before for a total hunting ban , but opposition in the upper house of lords , rooted deeply in the land-owning aristocracy , stalled legislation long enough for it to die on the order paper . if it is blocked again , prime minister tony blair has vowed to employ the parliament act - a rarely-used law allowing him to override the opinion of the upper house - to overrule the lords and get the ban on the law books . the government has said any ban will not come into effect for two years , though that could be shortened to 18 months to please anti-hunt hardliners within the labor party .
the ban would apply in england and wales , after scotland 's autonomous parliament imposed a similar measure two years ago . fox hunting is one of britain 's most bitter political issues , with a great number of country dwellers in favor of the activity but the majority of parliament and people in general against it . it is a quintessential british country pastime going back many centuries in which noisy packs of hounds chase a fox over rolling countryside , followed by hunters in bright red jackets galloping on horseback .
the fox , if it fails to escape , is eventually cornered , killed and ripped apart by the excited dogs before someone comes with a plastic bag and takes its remains away for disposal . some government officials in favor britain 's vocal animal welfare movement , outraged by the obvious brutality of the sport , have called for a ban for years , and influential members and factions of blair 's own labor party want to see it done away with as well . the pro-hunt camp , on the other hand , has threatened civil disobedience if a ban goes ahead - a tactic that rural affairs minister alun michael called ill-advised .
" the place for anybody who disagrees with the ban on hunting , the place to make their point is not on the streets but through the ballot box , " said michael on bbc radio . " we are being a reasonable , moderate government , saying this issue has to be resolved , we promised to resolve it , and if we can only resolve it by the use of the parliament act , then that will be done . " no widespread ban in europe the ban would bring britain into line with other european countries like belgium , switzerland and germany where hunting with hounds is banned , although in germany it is still legal to use hounds to drive the hunted animal towards a shooting party .
however , hunting with hounds , either on foot or on horseback , remains popular and legal in ireland , the netherlands , portugal , spain , italy and france . the european commission has no common policy on blood sports .
the commission states that " there are no eu laws where animals are linked to national or local traditions and to culture … this includes bull fighting and fox hunting . "
it adds that only wild , migratory birds come under protection at eu level . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de love and betrayal in the animal kingdom in its latest major show , the german hygiene museum in dresden is exploring the contradictory relationship between people and animals .

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "
the modern-day homesteaders , however , certainly do n't have farming or ranching in mind . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a perfect place for artists a new cultural concept in the western german town of essen offers artists free space and inspiration to work on their projects .

here 's how week five shapes up . some bundesliga teams will return to action in week five fresh - and some not so fresh - from combative european competition in mid-week .
after the highs and lows of their champions league and uefa cup performances against teams like real madrid and inter milan , the german representatives will have to knuckle down once more for the domestic struggle for supremacy . after a trip to israel for their opening group stage game , the victorious players of bayern munich take the shorter journey to dortmund to take on bvb .
borussia dortmund were unlucky to lose a lead and eventually draw with bochum last weekend and will hope to keep their concentration against one of their biggest rivals when the bavarians arrive on saturday . bayern 's 1-0 win in the champions league may have restored a little stability and faith in a side teetering on the edge of an early season internal meltdown and if all the elements of their star-studded team are all pulling in the same direction , dortmund may have their hands full . buzzing bayer back to earth bayer leverkusen may still be on cloud nine by the time nuremberg come calling this weekend after dispatching the widely recognized " best team in the world " in their 3-0 european mid-week romp .
real madrid felt the cutting edge of klaus augenthaler 's rapier team and after losing an unbeaten 14 game streak to fsv mainz in week four , leverkusen will want to keep the momentum of wednesday night 's stunning win going in their domestic campaign . ninth place nuremberg floundered in the dullest game of the season so far last week , the 0-0 draw with an equally uninspiring berlin , and may not fancy dealing with a buoyant bayer .
however , nuremberg have had their moments this season and are not incapable of adding a second league defeat in a row to leverkusen . leverkusen 's conquerors mainz face arminia bielefeld away on saturday , looking down on their bottom of the league opponents from the lofty position of fourth spot .
both teams were promoted last season but things are now very different from how they were in the second bundesliga .
mainz , in their first ever season , are relishing their top flight soccer and have put in some great performances .
in-form mainz striker benni auer will be one bielefeld will have to watch as the home side attempt to keep the score down and chase some well needed points which could keep their solitary one company . stuttering champs need to settle nerves just above bottom placed bielefeld sit hanover 96 , visitors to stuttering champions werder bremen on saturday .
hanover are struggling at this early stage of the season and may be in two minds about the best course of action ahead of the weekend 's journey to bremen .
the champions are presenting a very schizophrenic image so far . hanover could struggle against the cavalier bremen team who are more than capable of turning over any team in the league on their day , or they could stand a decent chance of victory against the nervous werder side which has slipped to two consecutive league defeats and one loss in europe in the past three weeks . another team facing a crisis of confidence is schalke 04 who play host to borussia mönchengladbach at the weekend .
after waving goodbye to jupp heynckes , the manager-less and free-falling gelsenkirchen side will face mönchengladbach , werder bremen 's victors from week four , after an unpredictable visit to latvia in the uefa cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's marek heinz , celebrates after scroring against werder bremen .
mönchengladbach in tenth are on the up after languishing in the bottom section of the league for the first three weeks of the campaign , more than doubling their points total with last week 's win over the champions .
they could heap more misery on the rudderless royal blues as schalke 's season looks likely to get worse before it gets better . relegation-zone dog fights begin already kaiserslautern are hoping that their worst is over and that things are now getting better after recording their first points of the season last week with the 3-2 away win against hansa rostock .
the much-needed three points lifted kaiserslautern off the bottom of the league and up to a decidedly less dodgy 14th . on the way out of the relegation zone , they passed hamburg , their visitors on saturday , going in the opposite direction .
klaus toppmöller 's side had just managed to get themselves off the foot of the table a week before , passing the unenviable position to kaiserslautern , before losing to stuttgart in week four .
both teams are on shaky ground and the game could go either way with neither safely away from the drop zone . the team just above both kaiserslautern and hamburg is hansa rostock who entertain one of the form teams at the moment , vfl wolfsburg .
wolfsburg have back-to-back wins over werder bremen and schalke 04 to keep the confidence flowing and will be looking for a third consecutive win to keep the pressure on stuttgart at the top of the league .
hansa were unlucky to lose last week but will be fortunate to avoid a second defeat against second placed wolfsburg if thomas brdaric and co. are on fire once again . no daylight between bochum and freiburg bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum tried everything to get a result against dortmund but finsihed with a draw .
sc freiburg and vfl bochum meet on sunday with almost identical records to date .
bochum in seventh scraped a 2-2 draw from their ruhr valley derby with borussia dortmund last week to remain equal on points and goal difference with eighth placed freiburg , who also drew 2-2 with hanover .
there may be little to separate the teams on the day but bochum 's uefa cup clash with standard liege in belgium on thursday night may work in freiburg 's favour . the other match on sunday sees current league leaders vfb stuttgart travel to the capital to take on hertha berlin .

bayern munich also started in winning style but bundesliga champions werder bremen were beaten in milan . germany 's champions league teams got their campaigns underway on wednesday night with the distant but glittering prize of europe 's most coveted club trophy and title of european champion the ultimate goal .
the opening group games however were more about getting the first points on the board and boosting their chances of advancing from the mini-league format into the knock-out stages and eventually stepping out on the istanbul turf for the final on may 25 . bayer leverkusen took a giant stride to that knock-out stage by pulling off the result of the night by exacting revenge on spanish giants real madrid for their 2002 final defeat by beating zidane and co .
3-0 at the bayarena .
the sluggish galactic were far from the out-of-this-world team of old as goals from jacek krzynowek , franca and dimitar berbatov brought real crashing down to earth . despite their awesome reputation , real madrid have a terrible record in germany having won only once in 19 visits .
they rarely looked in good enough shape to change this record in the group b game on wednesday and appeared the juxtaposition of leverkusen 's rampaging confidence despite the presence on the pitch of all their top players . the victory over the nine times european champions broke a seven-game losing streak in the competition for leverkusen , including four defeats and a draw in their five previous champions league meetings with real , and they smashed that statistic in style . rapid second half goals kill off real bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's franca .

the spanish giants had no reply to leverkusen 's quick start to the second half and only rallied themselves towards the end but by then the game was over . bayern secure narrow win in tel aviv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay .
bayern munich began their group c campaign with a winning start with dutchman roy makaay on target for the only goal against maccabi haifa in tel aviv .
the bayern striker made no mistake with a second-half penalty that spoilt the festive occasion in the israeli capital where fans chose to celebrate the first champions league match played in israel rather than stay home and celebrate the start of the jewish new year . bayern coach felix magath could well be excused for breathing a huge sigh of relief after wednesday 's 1-0 win .
the embattled magath , who watched his players fight hard against the israeli debutants , said the victory was a stepping stone on which his team could build for the season . " i 'm pleased with the result and hope we can build on this .
i was n't happy with the first half performance as we were very pressured but the inclusion of sebastian schweinsteiger in the second half made a big difference and it got us the penalty . " maccabi coach nir klinger said he was very happy with the overall performance of his players , although he was disappointed with the way in which his team had lost the match . " bayern were under great pressure when the score was goalless but after we conceded the penalty we lost our intensity , " klinger said .
" our young side played well .
i 'm proud of them but we should have made it harder for bayern and we let them off the hook .
it was a bad mistake by john -lrb- pantsil -rrb- to give away the penalty , it was not typical of his play , " he added . the maccabi coach said people should not have expected miracles from his team even though bayern were not on top form .
" people thought we 'd be playing weak opponents but it was bayern .
we gave them too much respect early on , " klinger said . bremen undone by brazilian 's brilliance german champions werder bremen began their quest for european glory on tuesday night and would have been watching their countrymen 's exploits with envy after being steamrollered by a magnificent individual display by inter milan striker adriano in their 2-0 defeat in the san siro stadium , which left coach thomas schaaf wondering how the brazilian can be stopped after he struck both goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's coach thomas schaaf found adriano unstoppable .
“ inter deserved to win and were always dangerous when adriano got into a one-on-one situation , " schaaf -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters after the game .
" he is incredibly strong and it is very difficult to mark him .
it is almost impossible to keep him quiet for 90 minutes . ” werder were forced to play with 10 men from only the fifth minute after french defender valerien ismael was sent off for a “ professional foul ” inside the area on adriano in the group g match . although christian vieri missed that spot kick , adriano was brought down for another penalty which he himself converted in the 34th minute and then the brazilian blasted home inter ’ s second a minute from the end of the game . “ after the sending off it was always going to be difficult for us but i was really pleased with the way the players reacted and stuck at their task , ” schaaf told the post-match news conference . uefa cup gets underway on thursday more german teams head into european competition on thursday with the first round , first leg of the uefa cup .

the spanish giants had no reply to leverkusen 's quick start to the second half and only rallied themselves towards the end but by then the game was over . bayern secure narrow win in tel aviv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay .
bayern munich began their group c campaign with a winning start with dutchman roy makaay on target for the only goal against maccabi haifa in tel aviv .
the bayern striker made no mistake with a second-half penalty that spoilt the festive occasion in the israeli capital where fans chose to celebrate the first champions league match played in israel rather than stay home and celebrate the start of the jewish new year . bayern coach felix magath could well be excused for breathing a huge sigh of relief after wednesday 's 1-0 win .
the embattled magath , who watched his players fight hard against the israeli debutants , said the victory was a stepping stone on which his team could build for the season . " i 'm pleased with the result and hope we can build on this .
i was n't happy with the first half performance as we were very pressured but the inclusion of sebastian schweinsteiger in the second half made a big difference and it got us the penalty . " maccabi coach nir klinger said he was very happy with the overall performance of his players , although he was disappointed with the way in which his team had lost the match . " bayern were under great pressure when the score was goalless but after we conceded the penalty we lost our intensity , " klinger said .
" our young side played well .
i 'm proud of them but we should have made it harder for bayern and we let them off the hook .
it was a bad mistake by john -lrb- pantsil -rrb- to give away the penalty , it was not typical of his play , " he added . the maccabi coach said people should not have expected miracles from his team even though bayern were not on top form .
" people thought we 'd be playing weak opponents but it was bayern .
we gave them too much respect early on , " klinger said . bremen undone by brazilian 's brilliance german champions werder bremen began their quest for european glory on tuesday night and would have been watching their countrymen 's exploits with envy after being steamrollered by a magnificent individual display by inter milan striker adriano in their 2-0 defeat in the san siro stadium , which left coach thomas schaaf wondering how the brazilian can be stopped after he struck both goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's coach thomas schaaf found adriano unstoppable .
“ inter deserved to win and were always dangerous when adriano got into a one-on-one situation , " schaaf -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters after the game .
" he is incredibly strong and it is very difficult to mark him .
it is almost impossible to keep him quiet for 90 minutes . ” werder were forced to play with 10 men from only the fifth minute after french defender valerien ismael was sent off for a “ professional foul ” inside the area on adriano in the group g match . although christian vieri missed that spot kick , adriano was brought down for another penalty which he himself converted in the 34th minute and then the brazilian blasted home inter ’ s second a minute from the end of the game . “ after the sending off it was always going to be difficult for us but i was really pleased with the way the players reacted and stuck at their task , ” schaaf told the post-match news conference . uefa cup gets underway on thursday more german teams head into european competition on thursday with the first round , first leg of the uefa cup .

but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen . take a peek inside the fruit and vegetable store where kahalid saeed aydin works , and it looks like turkey is already part of the european union .
he sells italian grapes and nectarines , spanish oranges and german apples .
in the refrigerated case by the cash register french and turkish sheep cheese soak in brine next to each other , on sale for the same price .
but the inside of the store in the western german city of koblenz is deceptive .
turkey is not part of the eu , but it 's been an official candidate for membership since 1999 .
an independent commission on turkey will report on its findings , which call the beginning of accession talks " politically imperative , " in vienna thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half the products kahalid saeed aydin sells come from turkey though generally not interested in politics , aydin -lrb- photo -rrb- said turkey joining the eu would be good , but would n't have a large effect on his own life , as he is " already in the eu . "
other turks in germany - who total 2.6 million and make up the country 's largest immigrant group - echo his feelings and wonder what concrete changes eu membership would have for them .
" what should change with the eu , " asked ibrahim tasar , the owner of three snack bars in bonn , who has lived in germany since 1992 .
" i have my business ; i can travel ; i work hard .
the eu wo n't change that . "
psychological changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish community is germany 's largest immigrant group observers of the german-turkish community agree that people with turkish roots living in germany will have to keep working hard , but some emotional changes could take place if the european council decides to start accession negotiations with ankara when it meets in december .
" people would have a sense of social recognition similar to that of germans or other minorities in germany - that 's the main motive behind their support , " dirk halm , a spokesman for the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university , told dw-world .
it 's emotional changes , not economic benefits , that most interest mustafa schat , head of the german-turkish economic center in cologne .
" it would change the discussions about turkish people in germany , " he said .
" i could say , ' we europeans . '
it would be clear to everyone that turkey belongs to europe . "
does turkey belong in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a place for a crescent in the europe 's star-filled flag ?
currently , not everyone in the eu agrees on turkey 's place in europe .
eu agriculture commissioner franz fischer has called turkey " much more oriental than european " and campaigned against starting negations with the country .
on the other hand , tasar , the snack bar owner , and the independent commission , affirm turkey is part of europe , with the report describing the country as a society oriented " toward europe and the west . "
already a key member of nato , part of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and playing in europe 's soccer scene , the eu is one of the only european organizations where turkey does not have a seat .
economic changes already happened about 75 percent of turkey 's 70 million people would vote to join the eu , mostly for economic reasons , according to the report .
but there would be few economic benefits for turkish people and businesses that have already put down their roots in germany .
germany has had an import-export deal with turkey since 1996 , which would decrease the economic effects of eu membership since there are n't many trade barriers now , center for studies on turkey spokesman halm said .
" our status as a partner has already brought a positive economic effect , " schat of the german-turkish economic center said .
" many turk-run companies here do n't rely on the turkish market or turkish goods . "
there could , however , be advantages for companies in the service , transport and tourism industries if turkey is admitted to the eu , he added .
reforms are key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion commissioner verheugen thinks 2015 is the earliest turkey could join the eu before any possible negotiations end , making turkey a full eu member , which could happen in 2015 " at the earliest , " according to european expansion commissioner günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , politicians want to be sure ankara is serious about its reforms - which the turkish-german community is also interested in .
members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "
in an effort to show europe it 's ready to begin talks , in the last two years turkey has passed laws increasing freedom of speech and reducing the role of the military , with the latest batch coming two weeks ago .
turkey is counting on receiving a date ; all of their reforms had the goal of getting them ready for the eu , halm said .
he expects the country to receive one from the european council in december .
" i think once turkey is admitted to the eu , people will ask themselves , ' why did n't we do this 10 years ago ? , " ' tasar said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

turkish companies on the whole are economically very successful , but have done relatively little by way of creating training jobs , said kemal sahin , president of the german-turkish chamber of commerce .
" -lrb- turkish firms -rrb- have created 350,000 jobs , " he said .

the study looked at 130 suicide notes left behind by people between 65 and 95 years old from 1995 to 2003 and also found most of the elderly who took their own lives also suffered from depression , dementia or chronic pain .
many older people are worried about the state of germany 's old people 's homes , reinhard linder , who has examined the phenomenon of elderly suicide in his work at the center for suicidal behavior studies in hamburg , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .
however germany will have to struggle to improve or even maintain the quality of its nursing homes .
the marburger association of doctors , an association of german hospital doctors , said it expected the number of people suffering from dementia to increase to 1.8 million people by 2010 . ralf lehnert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de increasing awareness for dementia as an international conference on alzheimer kicks off in philadelphia , germans are still struggling to figure out how to deal with the problem : most nursing homes are still ill-equipped to respond to patients needs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.09.2004 bright lights , big cities , no competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an expensive proposition : germany 's electricity grid germans have to dig deeper in their pockets to turn on lights , do a load of laundry , or heat their homes with electricity , than any other nation in europe . open markets and lower prices were the goals when the german electricity market was liberalized in 1999 .
today , electricity is 8 percent more expensive than it was before - the most costly in the european union .
a look at the pricing statistics of the energy information center in july 2004 makes it clear : a german household using 3500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year pays € 615 -lrb- $ 748 -rrb- , while in britain the same usage costs € 435 a year .
the finns got off the lightest , with a bill of € 370 .
in terms of europe-wide electricity prices for industrial users , germany came in at second place , behind italy .
and here is no lowering of prices in sight .
rather , the big energy providers , such as eon , vattenfall and rwe , want to increase electricity prices further .
warning : economy threatened this poses a danger to the german economy , said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin .
" energy intensive branches would be especially effected , for example the chemical sector , " she said .
especially now , when the germany economy is looking for an upswing , a price increase would be dubious , said kemfert .
" we hope that the big energy concerns consider the germany 's economic situation , and increase prices less than expected , " she said .
monopoly at fault electricity prices fell immediately following the liberalization of the electricity market four years ago .
but quickly thereafter , market tendencies such as mergers and takeovers in the energy industry led to increased electricity prices , kemfert said .
holger krawinkel , of the berlin consumer protection society said the current monopoly in germany 's energy sector is responsible for the high prices .
one important problem is the monopoly of the electricity grid .
energy producers have to pay high prices to use the grid .
a third of the net electricity cost can be attributed to fees for grid usage - with the usage tending to get more expensive , not less .
debate over regulation starting on jan .
1 , 2005 , the situation is expected to improve .
this past july , the german cabinet passed the energy economic law , establishing a regulatory body for the sector .
similar to the regulatory body for the telecommunication and postal services -lrb- regtp , -rrb- which it will be linked to , the new regulators should make sure there is fair competition on the german energy market .
the new body will differ from regtp in that it will be able to retrospectively control prices if they are shown to be abusive .
rather than celebrating the regulatory body , however , the consumer-advocate krawinkel said it is not a good idea .
" this so-called abuse oversight did n't work in the cartel office , and it is n't used by any other country , " he said .
only when a company is forced to provides in advance paperwork showing price approvals , can you assume they are complete , he added .
" if you want to try to fine the companies after the fact , they will naturally try to talk their way out of it , " krawinkel said .
" in our view , it just wo n't work . "
energy summit expected many german states demand prior examination and approval of electricity prices .
it is therefore questionable whether the regulatory body can actually begin its work at the beginning of the new year , as planned .
there will unquestionably be a gread deal of opposition in the bundesrat , the legislative body that represents the different states ' interests .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants to hold a summit meeting with representatives from the german energy industry , economy minister wolfgang clement , and environment minister jürgen trittin , in order to discuss the announced price increases .
however , an accord with the energy industry is unlikely , since the industry itself blames the higher prices on the government .
the electricity industry association -lrb- vdew -rrb- blames the situation on taxes and duties of up to 40 percent .
with price increases , the company could react to increased fuel prices and costs for promoting renewable energies , a vdew spokesperson told newspapers . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dung good germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .

turkey is not part of the eu , but it 's been an official candidate for membership since 1999 .

other turks in germany - who total 2.6 million and make up the country 's largest immigrant group - echo his feelings and wonder what concrete changes eu membership would have for them .

economic changes already happened about 75 percent of turkey 's 70 million people would vote to join the eu , mostly for economic reasons , according to the report .
but there would be few economic benefits for turkish people and businesses that have already put down their roots in germany .
germany has had an import-export deal with turkey since 1996 , which would decrease the economic effects of eu membership since there are n't many trade barriers now , center for studies on turkey spokesman halm said .

members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "

today , electricity is 8 percent more expensive than it was before - the most costly in the european union .
a look at the pricing statistics of the energy information center in july 2004 makes it clear : a german household using 3500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year pays € 615 -lrb- $ 748 -rrb- , while in britain the same usage costs € 435 a year .
the finns got off the lightest , with a bill of € 370 .
in terms of europe-wide electricity prices for industrial users , germany came in at second place , behind italy .
and here is no lowering of prices in sight .
rather , the big energy providers , such as eon , vattenfall and rwe , want to increase electricity prices further .
warning : economy threatened this poses a danger to the german economy , said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin .
" energy intensive branches would be especially effected , for example the chemical sector , " she said .
especially now , when the germany economy is looking for an upswing , a price increase would be dubious , said kemfert .
" we hope that the big energy concerns consider the germany 's economic situation , and increase prices less than expected , " she said .
monopoly at fault electricity prices fell immediately following the liberalization of the electricity market four years ago .
but quickly thereafter , market tendencies such as mergers and takeovers in the energy industry led to increased electricity prices , kemfert said .
holger krawinkel , of the berlin consumer protection society said the current monopoly in germany 's energy sector is responsible for the high prices .
one important problem is the monopoly of the electricity grid .
energy producers have to pay high prices to use the grid .
a third of the net electricity cost can be attributed to fees for grid usage - with the usage tending to get more expensive , not less .
debate over regulation starting on jan .
1 , 2005 , the situation is expected to improve .
this past july , the german cabinet passed the energy economic law , establishing a regulatory body for the sector .
similar to the regulatory body for the telecommunication and postal services -lrb- regtp , -rrb- which it will be linked to , the new regulators should make sure there is fair competition on the german energy market .
the new body will differ from regtp in that it will be able to retrospectively control prices if they are shown to be abusive .
rather than celebrating the regulatory body , however , the consumer-advocate krawinkel said it is not a good idea .
" this so-called abuse oversight did n't work in the cartel office , and it is n't used by any other country , " he said .
only when a company is forced to provides in advance paperwork showing price approvals , can you assume they are complete , he added .
" if you want to try to fine the companies after the fact , they will naturally try to talk their way out of it , " krawinkel said .
" in our view , it just wo n't work . "
energy summit expected many german states demand prior examination and approval of electricity prices .
it is therefore questionable whether the regulatory body can actually begin its work at the beginning of the new year , as planned .
there will unquestionably be a gread deal of opposition in the bundesrat , the legislative body that represents the different states ' interests .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants to hold a summit meeting with representatives from the german energy industry , economy minister wolfgang clement , and environment minister jürgen trittin , in order to discuss the announced price increases .
however , an accord with the energy industry is unlikely , since the industry itself blames the higher prices on the government .
the electricity industry association -lrb- vdew -rrb- blames the situation on taxes and duties of up to 40 percent .
with price increases , the company could react to increased fuel prices and costs for promoting renewable energies , a vdew spokesperson told newspapers . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dung good germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .

but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen . take a peek inside the fruit and vegetable store where kahalid saeed aydin works , and it looks like turkey is already part of the european union .
he sells italian grapes and nectarines , spanish oranges and german apples .
in the refrigerated case by the cash register french and turkish sheep cheese soak in brine next to each other , on sale for the same price .
but the inside of the store in the western german city of koblenz is deceptive .
turkey is not part of the eu , but it 's been an official candidate for membership since 1999 .
an independent commission on turkey will report on its findings , which call the beginning of accession talks " politically imperative , " in vienna thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half the products kahalid saeed aydin sells come from turkey though generally not interested in politics , aydin -lrb- photo -rrb- said turkey joining the eu would be good , but would n't have a large effect on his own life , as he is " already in the eu . "
other turks in germany - who total 2.6 million and make up the country 's largest immigrant group - echo his feelings and wonder what concrete changes eu membership would have for them .
" what should change with the eu , " asked ibrahim tasar , the owner of three snack bars in bonn , who has lived in germany since 1992 .
" i have my business ; i can travel ; i work hard .
the eu wo n't change that . "
psychological changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish community is germany 's largest immigrant group observers of the german-turkish community agree that people with turkish roots living in germany will have to keep working hard , but some emotional changes could take place if the european council decides to start accession negotiations with ankara when it meets in december .
" people would have a sense of social recognition similar to that of germans or other minorities in germany - that 's the main motive behind their support , " dirk halm , a spokesman for the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university , told dw-world .
it 's emotional changes , not economic benefits , that most interest mustafa schat , head of the german-turkish economic center in cologne .
" it would change the discussions about turkish people in germany , " he said .
" i could say , ' we europeans . '
it would be clear to everyone that turkey belongs to europe . "
does turkey belong in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a place for a crescent in the europe 's star-filled flag ?
currently , not everyone in the eu agrees on turkey 's place in europe .
eu agriculture commissioner franz fischer has called turkey " much more oriental than european " and campaigned against starting negations with the country .
on the other hand , tasar , the snack bar owner , and the independent commission , affirm turkey is part of europe , with the report describing the country as a society oriented " toward europe and the west . "
already a key member of nato , part of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and playing in europe 's soccer scene , the eu is one of the only european organizations where turkey does not have a seat .
economic changes already happened about 75 percent of turkey 's 70 million people would vote to join the eu , mostly for economic reasons , according to the report .
but there would be few economic benefits for turkish people and businesses that have already put down their roots in germany .
germany has had an import-export deal with turkey since 1996 , which would decrease the economic effects of eu membership since there are n't many trade barriers now , center for studies on turkey spokesman halm said .
" our status as a partner has already brought a positive economic effect , " schat of the german-turkish economic center said .
" many turk-run companies here do n't rely on the turkish market or turkish goods . "
there could , however , be advantages for companies in the service , transport and tourism industries if turkey is admitted to the eu , he added .
reforms are key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion commissioner verheugen thinks 2015 is the earliest turkey could join the eu before any possible negotiations end , making turkey a full eu member , which could happen in 2015 " at the earliest , " according to european expansion commissioner günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , politicians want to be sure ankara is serious about its reforms - which the turkish-german community is also interested in .
members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "
in an effort to show europe it 's ready to begin talks , in the last two years turkey has passed laws increasing freedom of speech and reducing the role of the military , with the latest batch coming two weeks ago .
turkey is counting on receiving a date ; all of their reforms had the goal of getting them ready for the eu , halm said .
he expects the country to receive one from the european council in december .
" i think once turkey is admitted to the eu , people will ask themselves , ' why did n't we do this 10 years ago ? , " ' tasar said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

the study looked at 130 suicide notes left behind by people between 65 and 95 years old from 1995 to 2003 and also found most of the elderly who took their own lives also suffered from depression , dementia or chronic pain .
many older people are worried about the state of germany 's old people 's homes , reinhard linder , who has examined the phenomenon of elderly suicide in his work at the center for suicidal behavior studies in hamburg , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .
however germany will have to struggle to improve or even maintain the quality of its nursing homes .

but these firms are less likely to offer much needed training positions for students - an integral part of germany 's education system . germany 's education ministry , the german chamber of commerce and 14 international business associations agreed wednesday on an initiative to raise the number of official training positions offered for young " foreigners " living in germany .
turkish companies on the whole are economically very successful , but have done relatively little by way of creating training jobs , said kemal sahin , president of the german-turkish chamber of commerce .
" -lrb- turkish firms -rrb- have created 350,000 jobs , " he said .
" but for future workers they have n't done much .
their quota of training positions is under 6 percent .
so , there a long way still to go . "
bilingual personnel needed foreign companies are especially in need of bilingual workers who have knowledge of different cultures .
if despite this need they fail to train more workers it is because they do n't know any better , said salvatore condipodaro , who is in charge of an association of italian companies .
" as -lrb- foreign -rrb- businesses , we laid our foundation based on what we brought with us when we came to germany - our own system of training , which was nonexistent , " he said .
" we did n't learn enough about the way things are done here .
that 's why there has n't been more done here so far . "
navigating the system many foreign companies simply do not know about germany 's so-called " dual system , " in which an official , state-sanctioned training position is offered in combination with attendance at a vocational school .
others were either intimidated by the thought of jumping through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to attain the right to a training position , or ausbildungsberechtigung , or else they simply did n't want to bother .
in recent time , the rules pertaining to such training positions have been relaxed .
nonetheless , for many foreign firms , it simply does n't occur to them to offer official training positions .
irina bernstein , a russian businesswoman who works in media and advertising , explained how difficult it is to find qualified bilingual workers .
she finally began offering training positions when she found herself in a dire situation .
" i have to say , it was very easy for us to get the official go-ahead to offer the training positions , " she said .
" the berlin chamber of commerce supported us , which made it really easy .
now we have three training positions , and we get trainees who are studying to work in administrative jobs . "
too little investment in the opinion of german education minister edelgard bulmahn , many more foreign firms should follow bernstein 's example .
the benefit would be that such companies would need to hire " foreign " germans , meaning immigrants or the children of immigrants -lrb- even if the latter may have been born in the country -rrb- .
" foreign " youths generally have a much lower rate of finding training positions .
" i find it extremely unfortunate that such a great percentage of young immigrants are n't trained , " bulmahn said .
" the amount of training we invest in these young people is simply too little .
it is in their own interest to get a training position , but it is also in the interest of our economy to give them a chance to train . "
the education minister strongly supports the initiative of the german-turkish chamber of commerce in its recently announced attempt to create 1,000 new training positions in turkish firms .

many older people are worried about the state of germany 's old people 's homes , reinhard linder , who has examined the phenomenon of elderly suicide in his work at the center for suicidal behavior studies in hamburg , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .
however germany will have to struggle to improve or even maintain the quality of its nursing homes .
the marburger association of doctors , an association of german hospital doctors , said it expected the number of people suffering from dementia to increase to 1.8 million people by 2010 . ralf lehnert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de increasing awareness for dementia as an international conference on alzheimer kicks off in philadelphia , germans are still struggling to figure out how to deal with the problem : most nursing homes are still ill-equipped to respond to patients needs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.09.2004 real rout is sweet revenge for leverkusen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimitar berbatov -lrb- left -rrb- completed the 3-0 win against the galacticos bayer leverkusen opened their champions league campaign with a stunning 3-0 victory over real madrid on wednesday .
bayern munich also started in winning style but bundesliga champions werder bremen were beaten in milan . germany 's champions league teams got their campaigns underway on wednesday night with the distant but glittering prize of europe 's most coveted club trophy and title of european champion the ultimate goal .
the opening group games however were more about getting the first points on the board and boosting their chances of advancing from the mini-league format into the knock-out stages and eventually stepping out on the istanbul turf for the final on may 25 . bayer leverkusen took a giant stride to that knock-out stage by pulling off the result of the night by exacting revenge on spanish giants real madrid for their 2002 final defeat by beating zidane and co .
3-0 at the bayarena .
the sluggish galactic were far from the out-of-this-world team of old as goals from jacek krzynowek , franca and dimitar berbatov brought real crashing down to earth . despite their awesome reputation , real madrid have a terrible record in germany having won only once in 19 visits .
they rarely looked in good enough shape to change this record in the group b game on wednesday and appeared the juxtaposition of leverkusen 's rampaging confidence despite the presence on the pitch of all their top players . the victory over the nine times european champions broke a seven-game losing streak in the competition for leverkusen , including four defeats and a draw in their five previous champions league meetings with real , and they smashed that statistic in style . rapid second half goals kill off real bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's franca .
poland midfielder krzynowek put them ahead with a powerful shot from 25 meters after 39 minutes .
then brazilian striker franca -lrb- photo -rrb- doubled their lead from the edge of the penalty area five minutes into the second half and bulgaria striker berbatov completed the victory from close range five minutes later . leverkusen 's bundesliga star outshone the likes of zinedine zidane , luis figo and ronaldo who were all substituted after looking shadows of their usual selves while recent signing michael owen kept the bench warm all night .
the spanish giants had no reply to leverkusen 's quick start to the second half and only rallied themselves towards the end but by then the game was over . bayern secure narrow win in tel aviv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay .
bayern munich began their group c campaign with a winning start with dutchman roy makaay on target for the only goal against maccabi haifa in tel aviv .
the bayern striker made no mistake with a second-half penalty that spoilt the festive occasion in the israeli capital where fans chose to celebrate the first champions league match played in israel rather than stay home and celebrate the start of the jewish new year . bayern coach felix magath could well be excused for breathing a huge sigh of relief after wednesday 's 1-0 win .

opponents say it is both elitist and barbaric , with a pack of dogs tracking a live animal and then tearing it apart . lords stalled original bill the commons has voted before for a total hunting ban , but opposition in the upper house of lords , rooted deeply in the land-owning aristocracy , stalled legislation long enough for it to die on the order paper . if it is blocked again , prime minister tony blair has vowed to employ the parliament act - a rarely-used law allowing him to override the opinion of the upper house - to overrule the lords and get the ban on the law books . the government has said any ban will not come into effect for two years , though that could be shortened to 18 months to please anti-hunt hardliners within the labor party .
the ban would apply in england and wales , after scotland 's autonomous parliament imposed a similar measure two years ago . fox hunting is one of britain 's most bitter political issues , with a great number of country dwellers in favor of the activity but the majority of parliament and people in general against it . it is a quintessential british country pastime going back many centuries in which noisy packs of hounds chase a fox over rolling countryside , followed by hunters in bright red jackets galloping on horseback .
the fox , if it fails to escape , is eventually cornered , killed and ripped apart by the excited dogs before someone comes with a plastic bag and takes its remains away for disposal . some government officials in favor britain 's vocal animal welfare movement , outraged by the obvious brutality of the sport , have called for a ban for years , and influential members and factions of blair 's own labor party want to see it done away with as well . the pro-hunt camp , on the other hand , has threatened civil disobedience if a ban goes ahead - a tactic that rural affairs minister alun michael called ill-advised .
" the place for anybody who disagrees with the ban on hunting , the place to make their point is not on the streets but through the ballot box , " said michael on bbc radio . " we are being a reasonable , moderate government , saying this issue has to be resolved , we promised to resolve it , and if we can only resolve it by the use of the parliament act , then that will be done . " no widespread ban in europe the ban would bring britain into line with other european countries like belgium , switzerland and germany where hunting with hounds is banned , although in germany it is still legal to use hounds to drive the hunted animal towards a shooting party .
however , hunting with hounds , either on foot or on horseback , remains popular and legal in ireland , the netherlands , portugal , spain , italy and france . the european commission has no common policy on blood sports .
the commission states that " there are no eu laws where animals are linked to national or local traditions and to culture … this includes bull fighting and fox hunting . "

bayern munich also started in winning style but bundesliga champions werder bremen were beaten in milan . germany 's champions league teams got their campaigns underway on wednesday night with the distant but glittering prize of europe 's most coveted club trophy and title of european champion the ultimate goal .
the opening group games however were more about getting the first points on the board and boosting their chances of advancing from the mini-league format into the knock-out stages and eventually stepping out on the istanbul turf for the final on may 25 . bayer leverkusen took a giant stride to that knock-out stage by pulling off the result of the night by exacting revenge on spanish giants real madrid for their 2002 final defeat by beating zidane and co .
3-0 at the bayarena .
the sluggish galactic were far from the out-of-this-world team of old as goals from jacek krzynowek , franca and dimitar berbatov brought real crashing down to earth . despite their awesome reputation , real madrid have a terrible record in germany having won only once in 19 visits .
they rarely looked in good enough shape to change this record in the group b game on wednesday and appeared the juxtaposition of leverkusen 's rampaging confidence despite the presence on the pitch of all their top players . the victory over the nine times european champions broke a seven-game losing streak in the competition for leverkusen , including four defeats and a draw in their five previous champions league meetings with real , and they smashed that statistic in style . rapid second half goals kill off real bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's franca .
poland midfielder krzynowek put them ahead with a powerful shot from 25 meters after 39 minutes .
then brazilian striker franca -lrb- photo -rrb- doubled their lead from the edge of the penalty area five minutes into the second half and bulgaria striker berbatov completed the victory from close range five minutes later . leverkusen 's bundesliga star outshone the likes of zinedine zidane , luis figo and ronaldo who were all substituted after looking shadows of their usual selves while recent signing michael owen kept the bench warm all night .
the spanish giants had no reply to leverkusen 's quick start to the second half and only rallied themselves towards the end but by then the game was over . bayern secure narrow win in tel aviv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay .
bayern munich began their group c campaign with a winning start with dutchman roy makaay on target for the only goal against maccabi haifa in tel aviv .
the bayern striker made no mistake with a second-half penalty that spoilt the festive occasion in the israeli capital where fans chose to celebrate the first champions league match played in israel rather than stay home and celebrate the start of the jewish new year . bayern coach felix magath could well be excused for breathing a huge sigh of relief after wednesday 's 1-0 win .
the embattled magath , who watched his players fight hard against the israeli debutants , said the victory was a stepping stone on which his team could build for the season . " i 'm pleased with the result and hope we can build on this .
i was n't happy with the first half performance as we were very pressured but the inclusion of sebastian schweinsteiger in the second half made a big difference and it got us the penalty . " maccabi coach nir klinger said he was very happy with the overall performance of his players , although he was disappointed with the way in which his team had lost the match . " bayern were under great pressure when the score was goalless but after we conceded the penalty we lost our intensity , " klinger said .
" our young side played well .
i 'm proud of them but we should have made it harder for bayern and we let them off the hook .
it was a bad mistake by john -lrb- pantsil -rrb- to give away the penalty , it was not typical of his play , " he added . the maccabi coach said people should not have expected miracles from his team even though bayern were not on top form .

the study looked at 130 suicide notes left behind by people between 65 and 95 years old from 1995 to 2003 and also found most of the elderly who took their own lives also suffered from depression , dementia or chronic pain .
many older people are worried about the state of germany 's old people 's homes , reinhard linder , who has examined the phenomenon of elderly suicide in his work at the center for suicidal behavior studies in hamburg , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .
however germany will have to struggle to improve or even maintain the quality of its nursing homes .
the marburger association of doctors , an association of german hospital doctors , said it expected the number of people suffering from dementia to increase to 1.8 million people by 2010 . ralf lehnert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de increasing awareness for dementia as an international conference on alzheimer kicks off in philadelphia , germans are still struggling to figure out how to deal with the problem : most nursing homes are still ill-equipped to respond to patients needs .

a look at the pricing statistics of the energy information center in july 2004 makes it clear : a german household using 3500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year pays € 615 -lrb- $ 748 -rrb- , while in britain the same usage costs € 435 a year .
the finns got off the lightest , with a bill of € 370 .
in terms of europe-wide electricity prices for industrial users , germany came in at second place , behind italy .
and here is no lowering of prices in sight .
rather , the big energy providers , such as eon , vattenfall and rwe , want to increase electricity prices further .
warning : economy threatened this poses a danger to the german economy , said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin .
" energy intensive branches would be especially effected , for example the chemical sector , " she said .
especially now , when the germany economy is looking for an upswing , a price increase would be dubious , said kemfert .
" we hope that the big energy concerns consider the germany 's economic situation , and increase prices less than expected , " she said .
monopoly at fault electricity prices fell immediately following the liberalization of the electricity market four years ago .
but quickly thereafter , market tendencies such as mergers and takeovers in the energy industry led to increased electricity prices , kemfert said .
holger krawinkel , of the berlin consumer protection society said the current monopoly in germany 's energy sector is responsible for the high prices .
one important problem is the monopoly of the electricity grid .
energy producers have to pay high prices to use the grid .
a third of the net electricity cost can be attributed to fees for grid usage - with the usage tending to get more expensive , not less .
debate over regulation starting on jan .
1 , 2005 , the situation is expected to improve .
this past july , the german cabinet passed the energy economic law , establishing a regulatory body for the sector .
similar to the regulatory body for the telecommunication and postal services -lrb- regtp , -rrb- which it will be linked to , the new regulators should make sure there is fair competition on the german energy market .
the new body will differ from regtp in that it will be able to retrospectively control prices if they are shown to be abusive .
rather than celebrating the regulatory body , however , the consumer-advocate krawinkel said it is not a good idea .
" this so-called abuse oversight did n't work in the cartel office , and it is n't used by any other country , " he said .
only when a company is forced to provides in advance paperwork showing price approvals , can you assume they are complete , he added .
" if you want to try to fine the companies after the fact , they will naturally try to talk their way out of it , " krawinkel said .
" in our view , it just wo n't work . "
energy summit expected many german states demand prior examination and approval of electricity prices .
it is therefore questionable whether the regulatory body can actually begin its work at the beginning of the new year , as planned .
there will unquestionably be a gread deal of opposition in the bundesrat , the legislative body that represents the different states ' interests .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants to hold a summit meeting with representatives from the german energy industry , economy minister wolfgang clement , and environment minister jürgen trittin , in order to discuss the announced price increases .
however , an accord with the energy industry is unlikely , since the industry itself blames the higher prices on the government .
the electricity industry association -lrb- vdew -rrb- blames the situation on taxes and duties of up to 40 percent .
with price increases , the company could react to increased fuel prices and costs for promoting renewable energies , a vdew spokesperson told newspapers . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dung good germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .

each september , the german mountaineering and hiking association sponsors a national hiking day , which serves as an annual reunion for german hiking aficionados and gives members in the country 's many local clubs a chance to get together at one big event . the mountaineering and hiking association is charged with grooming and marking some 190,000 kilometers -lrb- 118,000 miles -rrb- of trails , many of which traverse mountainous landscapes .
the association can also provide information on the many hütten , or huts , that lie along the trails and provide shelter for hikers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grab a friend and go explore there are 78 officially designated trails and trail networks that the association has recognized , but four main hiking regions stand out as germany 's most popular and most impressive .
-lrb- americans could compare these to hiking the appalachian or rocky mountain trails , while brits could keep the peak district or the scottish highlands in mind . -rrb- as the crisp autumn weather begins in germany , now may be the time to embark on one of the following trails : maximiliansweg and the bavarian forest first of the four is the maximiliansweg , which follows the route in the bavarian alps that king maximilian ii took when he crossed the mountain range in the company of a large entourage -lrb- which included writers to document the tour -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking is for any age the route goes from the allgäu region to lake königsee , and takes about 14 days .

known as europe 's green roof , the bavarian forest is central europe 's largest closed woodland area .
the region once housed more than 60 glass works , a handful of which still exist today , and the " gläserner steig " -lrb- glass ascent -rrb- trail takes hikers right through this region - which leads past glass works and traditional manufacturing villages - in a walk that takes about six days . black forest and sauerland the network of hiking trails in the black forest consists of more than 23,000 kilometers of signposted hiking trails which criss-cross the most beautiful areas of the region .
the most famous of these are the 16 long-distance hiking routes on the " westweg " route . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beech trees in sauerland the route crosses the european watershed , between the rhine and danube rivers .
this part of the trail offers superb views across the deep valleys of the western black forest and the flat high-lying valleys in the east . finally , the rothaarsteig in the eastern sauerland low-mountain region -lrb- the highest peak is some 840 meters in altitude -rrb- is less touristy and offers more nature and less culture than the others .
the path that leads through the area is rough and sometimes a bit wild . crystal clear waters flow , having been filtered by numerous layers of slate , originating from the rivers ruhr , eder , lenne , dill , lahn and sieg .

bayern munich also started in winning style but bundesliga champions werder bremen were beaten in milan . germany 's champions league teams got their campaigns underway on wednesday night with the distant but glittering prize of europe 's most coveted club trophy and title of european champion the ultimate goal .
the opening group games however were more about getting the first points on the board and boosting their chances of advancing from the mini-league format into the knock-out stages and eventually stepping out on the istanbul turf for the final on may 25 . bayer leverkusen took a giant stride to that knock-out stage by pulling off the result of the night by exacting revenge on spanish giants real madrid for their 2002 final defeat by beating zidane and co .
3-0 at the bayarena .
the sluggish galactic were far from the out-of-this-world team of old as goals from jacek krzynowek , franca and dimitar berbatov brought real crashing down to earth . despite their awesome reputation , real madrid have a terrible record in germany having won only once in 19 visits .
they rarely looked in good enough shape to change this record in the group b game on wednesday and appeared the juxtaposition of leverkusen 's rampaging confidence despite the presence on the pitch of all their top players . the victory over the nine times european champions broke a seven-game losing streak in the competition for leverkusen , including four defeats and a draw in their five previous champions league meetings with real , and they smashed that statistic in style . rapid second half goals kill off real bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's franca .
poland midfielder krzynowek put them ahead with a powerful shot from 25 meters after 39 minutes .
then brazilian striker franca -lrb- photo -rrb- doubled their lead from the edge of the penalty area five minutes into the second half and bulgaria striker berbatov completed the victory from close range five minutes later . leverkusen 's bundesliga star outshone the likes of zinedine zidane , luis figo and ronaldo who were all substituted after looking shadows of their usual selves while recent signing michael owen kept the bench warm all night .
the spanish giants had no reply to leverkusen 's quick start to the second half and only rallied themselves towards the end but by then the game was over . bayern secure narrow win in tel aviv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay .
bayern munich began their group c campaign with a winning start with dutchman roy makaay on target for the only goal against maccabi haifa in tel aviv .
the bayern striker made no mistake with a second-half penalty that spoilt the festive occasion in the israeli capital where fans chose to celebrate the first champions league match played in israel rather than stay home and celebrate the start of the jewish new year . bayern coach felix magath could well be excused for breathing a huge sigh of relief after wednesday 's 1-0 win .
the embattled magath , who watched his players fight hard against the israeli debutants , said the victory was a stepping stone on which his team could build for the season . " i 'm pleased with the result and hope we can build on this .
i was n't happy with the first half performance as we were very pressured but the inclusion of sebastian schweinsteiger in the second half made a big difference and it got us the penalty . " maccabi coach nir klinger said he was very happy with the overall performance of his players , although he was disappointed with the way in which his team had lost the match . " bayern were under great pressure when the score was goalless but after we conceded the penalty we lost our intensity , " klinger said .
" our young side played well .
i 'm proud of them but we should have made it harder for bayern and we let them off the hook .
it was a bad mistake by john -lrb- pantsil -rrb- to give away the penalty , it was not typical of his play , " he added . the maccabi coach said people should not have expected miracles from his team even though bayern were not on top form .
" people thought we 'd be playing weak opponents but it was bayern .
we gave them too much respect early on , " klinger said . bremen undone by brazilian 's brilliance german champions werder bremen began their quest for european glory on tuesday night and would have been watching their countrymen 's exploits with envy after being steamrollered by a magnificent individual display by inter milan striker adriano in their 2-0 defeat in the san siro stadium , which left coach thomas schaaf wondering how the brazilian can be stopped after he struck both goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's coach thomas schaaf found adriano unstoppable .
“ inter deserved to win and were always dangerous when adriano got into a one-on-one situation , " schaaf -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters after the game .
" he is incredibly strong and it is very difficult to mark him .
it is almost impossible to keep him quiet for 90 minutes . ” werder were forced to play with 10 men from only the fifth minute after french defender valerien ismael was sent off for a “ professional foul ” inside the area on adriano in the group g match . although christian vieri missed that spot kick , adriano was brought down for another penalty which he himself converted in the 34th minute and then the brazilian blasted home inter ’ s second a minute from the end of the game . “ after the sending off it was always going to be difficult for us but i was really pleased with the way the players reacted and stuck at their task , ” schaaf told the post-match news conference . uefa cup gets underway on thursday more german teams head into european competition on thursday with the first round , first leg of the uefa cup .

bayern munich also started in winning style but bundesliga champions werder bremen were beaten in milan . germany 's champions league teams got their campaigns underway on wednesday night with the distant but glittering prize of europe 's most coveted club trophy and title of european champion the ultimate goal .
the opening group games however were more about getting the first points on the board and boosting their chances of advancing from the mini-league format into the knock-out stages and eventually stepping out on the istanbul turf for the final on may 25 . bayer leverkusen took a giant stride to that knock-out stage by pulling off the result of the night by exacting revenge on spanish giants real madrid for their 2002 final defeat by beating zidane and co .
3-0 at the bayarena .
the sluggish galactic were far from the out-of-this-world team of old as goals from jacek krzynowek , franca and dimitar berbatov brought real crashing down to earth . despite their awesome reputation , real madrid have a terrible record in germany having won only once in 19 visits .
they rarely looked in good enough shape to change this record in the group b game on wednesday and appeared the juxtaposition of leverkusen 's rampaging confidence despite the presence on the pitch of all their top players . the victory over the nine times european champions broke a seven-game losing streak in the competition for leverkusen , including four defeats and a draw in their five previous champions league meetings with real , and they smashed that statistic in style . rapid second half goals kill off real bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen 's franca .
poland midfielder krzynowek put them ahead with a powerful shot from 25 meters after 39 minutes .
then brazilian striker franca -lrb- photo -rrb- doubled their lead from the edge of the penalty area five minutes into the second half and bulgaria striker berbatov completed the victory from close range five minutes later . leverkusen 's bundesliga star outshone the likes of zinedine zidane , luis figo and ronaldo who were all substituted after looking shadows of their usual selves while recent signing michael owen kept the bench warm all night .
the spanish giants had no reply to leverkusen 's quick start to the second half and only rallied themselves towards the end but by then the game was over . bayern secure narrow win in tel aviv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay .
bayern munich began their group c campaign with a winning start with dutchman roy makaay on target for the only goal against maccabi haifa in tel aviv .
the bayern striker made no mistake with a second-half penalty that spoilt the festive occasion in the israeli capital where fans chose to celebrate the first champions league match played in israel rather than stay home and celebrate the start of the jewish new year . bayern coach felix magath could well be excused for breathing a huge sigh of relief after wednesday 's 1-0 win .
the embattled magath , who watched his players fight hard against the israeli debutants , said the victory was a stepping stone on which his team could build for the season . " i 'm pleased with the result and hope we can build on this .
i was n't happy with the first half performance as we were very pressured but the inclusion of sebastian schweinsteiger in the second half made a big difference and it got us the penalty . " maccabi coach nir klinger said he was very happy with the overall performance of his players , although he was disappointed with the way in which his team had lost the match . " bayern were under great pressure when the score was goalless but after we conceded the penalty we lost our intensity , " klinger said .
" our young side played well .
i 'm proud of them but we should have made it harder for bayern and we let them off the hook .
it was a bad mistake by john -lrb- pantsil -rrb- to give away the penalty , it was not typical of his play , " he added . the maccabi coach said people should not have expected miracles from his team even though bayern were not on top form .
" people thought we 'd be playing weak opponents but it was bayern .
we gave them too much respect early on , " klinger said . bremen undone by brazilian 's brilliance german champions werder bremen began their quest for european glory on tuesday night and would have been watching their countrymen 's exploits with envy after being steamrollered by a magnificent individual display by inter milan striker adriano in their 2-0 defeat in the san siro stadium , which left coach thomas schaaf wondering how the brazilian can be stopped after he struck both goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's coach thomas schaaf found adriano unstoppable .
“ inter deserved to win and were always dangerous when adriano got into a one-on-one situation , " schaaf -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters after the game .
" he is incredibly strong and it is very difficult to mark him .
it is almost impossible to keep him quiet for 90 minutes . ” werder were forced to play with 10 men from only the fifth minute after french defender valerien ismael was sent off for a “ professional foul ” inside the area on adriano in the group g match . although christian vieri missed that spot kick , adriano was brought down for another penalty which he himself converted in the 34th minute and then the brazilian blasted home inter ’ s second a minute from the end of the game . “ after the sending off it was always going to be difficult for us but i was really pleased with the way the players reacted and stuck at their task , ” schaaf told the post-match news conference . uefa cup gets underway on thursday more german teams head into european competition on thursday with the first round , first leg of the uefa cup .

but these firms are less likely to offer much needed training positions for students - an integral part of germany 's education system . germany 's education ministry , the german chamber of commerce and 14 international business associations agreed wednesday on an initiative to raise the number of official training positions offered for young " foreigners " living in germany .
turkish companies on the whole are economically very successful , but have done relatively little by way of creating training jobs , said kemal sahin , president of the german-turkish chamber of commerce .
" -lrb- turkish firms -rrb- have created 350,000 jobs , " he said .
" but for future workers they have n't done much .
their quota of training positions is under 6 percent .
so , there a long way still to go . "
bilingual personnel needed foreign companies are especially in need of bilingual workers who have knowledge of different cultures .
if despite this need they fail to train more workers it is because they do n't know any better , said salvatore condipodaro , who is in charge of an association of italian companies .
" as -lrb- foreign -rrb- businesses , we laid our foundation based on what we brought with us when we came to germany - our own system of training , which was nonexistent , " he said .
" we did n't learn enough about the way things are done here .
that 's why there has n't been more done here so far . "
navigating the system many foreign companies simply do not know about germany 's so-called " dual system , " in which an official , state-sanctioned training position is offered in combination with attendance at a vocational school .
others were either intimidated by the thought of jumping through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to attain the right to a training position , or ausbildungsberechtigung , or else they simply did n't want to bother .
in recent time , the rules pertaining to such training positions have been relaxed .
nonetheless , for many foreign firms , it simply does n't occur to them to offer official training positions .
irina bernstein , a russian businesswoman who works in media and advertising , explained how difficult it is to find qualified bilingual workers .
she finally began offering training positions when she found herself in a dire situation .
" i have to say , it was very easy for us to get the official go-ahead to offer the training positions , " she said .
" the berlin chamber of commerce supported us , which made it really easy .
now we have three training positions , and we get trainees who are studying to work in administrative jobs . "
too little investment in the opinion of german education minister edelgard bulmahn , many more foreign firms should follow bernstein 's example .
the benefit would be that such companies would need to hire " foreign " germans , meaning immigrants or the children of immigrants -lrb- even if the latter may have been born in the country -rrb- .
" foreign " youths generally have a much lower rate of finding training positions .
" i find it extremely unfortunate that such a great percentage of young immigrants are n't trained , " bulmahn said .
" the amount of training we invest in these young people is simply too little .
it is in their own interest to get a training position , but it is also in the interest of our economy to give them a chance to train . "
the education minister strongly supports the initiative of the german-turkish chamber of commerce in its recently announced attempt to create 1,000 new training positions in turkish firms .

but these firms are less likely to offer much needed training positions for students - an integral part of germany 's education system . germany 's education ministry , the german chamber of commerce and 14 international business associations agreed wednesday on an initiative to raise the number of official training positions offered for young " foreigners " living in germany .
turkish companies on the whole are economically very successful , but have done relatively little by way of creating training jobs , said kemal sahin , president of the german-turkish chamber of commerce .
" -lrb- turkish firms -rrb- have created 350,000 jobs , " he said .
" but for future workers they have n't done much .
their quota of training positions is under 6 percent .
so , there a long way still to go . "
bilingual personnel needed foreign companies are especially in need of bilingual workers who have knowledge of different cultures .
if despite this need they fail to train more workers it is because they do n't know any better , said salvatore condipodaro , who is in charge of an association of italian companies .
" as -lrb- foreign -rrb- businesses , we laid our foundation based on what we brought with us when we came to germany - our own system of training , which was nonexistent , " he said .
" we did n't learn enough about the way things are done here .
that 's why there has n't been more done here so far . "
navigating the system many foreign companies simply do not know about germany 's so-called " dual system , " in which an official , state-sanctioned training position is offered in combination with attendance at a vocational school .
others were either intimidated by the thought of jumping through the necessary bureaucratic hoops to attain the right to a training position , or ausbildungsberechtigung , or else they simply did n't want to bother .
in recent time , the rules pertaining to such training positions have been relaxed .
nonetheless , for many foreign firms , it simply does n't occur to them to offer official training positions .
irina bernstein , a russian businesswoman who works in media and advertising , explained how difficult it is to find qualified bilingual workers .
she finally began offering training positions when she found herself in a dire situation .
" i have to say , it was very easy for us to get the official go-ahead to offer the training positions , " she said .
" the berlin chamber of commerce supported us , which made it really easy .
now we have three training positions , and we get trainees who are studying to work in administrative jobs . "
too little investment in the opinion of german education minister edelgard bulmahn , many more foreign firms should follow bernstein 's example .
the benefit would be that such companies would need to hire " foreign " germans , meaning immigrants or the children of immigrants -lrb- even if the latter may have been born in the country -rrb- .
" foreign " youths generally have a much lower rate of finding training positions .
" i find it extremely unfortunate that such a great percentage of young immigrants are n't trained , " bulmahn said .

the study looked at 130 suicide notes left behind by people between 65 and 95 years old from 1995 to 2003 and also found most of the elderly who took their own lives also suffered from depression , dementia or chronic pain .
many older people are worried about the state of germany 's old people 's homes , reinhard linder , who has examined the phenomenon of elderly suicide in his work at the center for suicidal behavior studies in hamburg , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .
however germany will have to struggle to improve or even maintain the quality of its nursing homes .
the marburger association of doctors , an association of german hospital doctors , said it expected the number of people suffering from dementia to increase to 1.8 million people by 2010 . ralf lehnert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de increasing awareness for dementia as an international conference on alzheimer kicks off in philadelphia , germans are still struggling to figure out how to deal with the problem : most nursing homes are still ill-equipped to respond to patients needs .

each september , the german mountaineering and hiking association sponsors a national hiking day , which serves as an annual reunion for german hiking aficionados and gives members in the country 's many local clubs a chance to get together at one big event . the mountaineering and hiking association is charged with grooming and marking some 190,000 kilometers -lrb- 118,000 miles -rrb- of trails , many of which traverse mountainous landscapes .
the association can also provide information on the many hütten , or huts , that lie along the trails and provide shelter for hikers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grab a friend and go explore there are 78 officially designated trails and trail networks that the association has recognized , but four main hiking regions stand out as germany 's most popular and most impressive .
-lrb- americans could compare these to hiking the appalachian or rocky mountain trails , while brits could keep the peak district or the scottish highlands in mind . -rrb- as the crisp autumn weather begins in germany , now may be the time to embark on one of the following trails : maximiliansweg and the bavarian forest first of the four is the maximiliansweg , which follows the route in the bavarian alps that king maximilian ii took when he crossed the mountain range in the company of a large entourage -lrb- which included writers to document the tour -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking is for any age the route goes from the allgäu region to lake königsee , and takes about 14 days .

known as europe 's green roof , the bavarian forest is central europe 's largest closed woodland area .
the region once housed more than 60 glass works , a handful of which still exist today , and the " gläserner steig " -lrb- glass ascent -rrb- trail takes hikers right through this region - which leads past glass works and traditional manufacturing villages - in a walk that takes about six days . black forest and sauerland the network of hiking trails in the black forest consists of more than 23,000 kilometers of signposted hiking trails which criss-cross the most beautiful areas of the region .
the most famous of these are the 16 long-distance hiking routes on the " westweg " route . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beech trees in sauerland the route crosses the european watershed , between the rhine and danube rivers .
this part of the trail offers superb views across the deep valleys of the western black forest and the flat high-lying valleys in the east . finally , the rothaarsteig in the eastern sauerland low-mountain region -lrb- the highest peak is some 840 meters in altitude -rrb- is less touristy and offers more nature and less culture than the others .
the path that leads through the area is rough and sometimes a bit wild . crystal clear waters flow , having been filtered by numerous layers of slate , originating from the rivers ruhr , eder , lenne , dill , lahn and sieg .

each september , the german mountaineering and hiking association sponsors a national hiking day , which serves as an annual reunion for german hiking aficionados and gives members in the country 's many local clubs a chance to get together at one big event . the mountaineering and hiking association is charged with grooming and marking some 190,000 kilometers -lrb- 118,000 miles -rrb- of trails , many of which traverse mountainous landscapes .
the association can also provide information on the many hütten , or huts , that lie along the trails and provide shelter for hikers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grab a friend and go explore there are 78 officially designated trails and trail networks that the association has recognized , but four main hiking regions stand out as germany 's most popular and most impressive .
-lrb- americans could compare these to hiking the appalachian or rocky mountain trails , while brits could keep the peak district or the scottish highlands in mind . -rrb- as the crisp autumn weather begins in germany , now may be the time to embark on one of the following trails : maximiliansweg and the bavarian forest first of the four is the maximiliansweg , which follows the route in the bavarian alps that king maximilian ii took when he crossed the mountain range in the company of a large entourage -lrb- which included writers to document the tour -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiking is for any age the route goes from the allgäu region to lake königsee , and takes about 14 days .
the strenuous trip encompasses some of the country 's most famous peaks , beautiful alpine landscapes and views of the bavarian alps . the second route leads through the bavarian forest , between the danube and the czech and austrian borders .
known as europe 's green roof , the bavarian forest is central europe 's largest closed woodland area .
the region once housed more than 60 glass works , a handful of which still exist today , and the " gläserner steig " -lrb- glass ascent -rrb- trail takes hikers right through this region - which leads past glass works and traditional manufacturing villages - in a walk that takes about six days . black forest and sauerland the network of hiking trails in the black forest consists of more than 23,000 kilometers of signposted hiking trails which criss-cross the most beautiful areas of the region .
the most famous of these are the 16 long-distance hiking routes on the " westweg " route . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beech trees in sauerland the route crosses the european watershed , between the rhine and danube rivers .
this part of the trail offers superb views across the deep valleys of the western black forest and the flat high-lying valleys in the east . finally , the rothaarsteig in the eastern sauerland low-mountain region -lrb- the highest peak is some 840 meters in altitude -rrb- is less touristy and offers more nature and less culture than the others .
the path that leads through the area is rough and sometimes a bit wild . crystal clear waters flow , having been filtered by numerous layers of slate , originating from the rivers ruhr , eder , lenne , dill , lahn and sieg .
the region offers an abundance of routes and paths that allow visitors to relax while discovering nature with all of their senses . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de luring tourists to a germany less traveled visits to germany 's more obscure destinations are rare by foreign tourists and even locals are often deterred .

german defense minister struck says his country wo n't contribute . increasingly , the european union has been called upon to help with peacekeeping and law enforcement in post-conflict regions like the balkans .
in december , nato will hand over command of the 7,000 strong peacekeeping force in bosnia to the eu . to help handle such undertakings , eu defense ministers - meeting in the dutch seaside resort town on friday - will announce the creation of a paramilitary force modeled on the french gendarmes or the italian carabinieri . unlike rapid reaction forces , which the eu is still in the process of putting together , the proposed gendarmes will not see active duty in conflict zones like iraq .
instead , they 'll concentrate on imposing law and order in post-conflict zones . germany not to participate german defense minister peter struck , who will also attend friday 's meeting , said his country would not contribute to the force .
" we have absolutely no plans to join this force , " struck told the german television station wdr on thursday . struck pointed to his country 's wwii history , which he says makes it difficult for germany to create military-style forces responsible for maintaining domestic law and order in other countries . five other countries - france , italy , spain , portugal and the netherlands - have already publicly stated their support for the project .
in addition to germany , poland and belgium have not agreed to contribute troops .
still , both have reserved the right to participate at a later date . yet another eu defense plan the plan calls for the creation of an 800-strong force that can be deployed within 30 days by 2005 .
the idea was initially proposed last september by french defense minister michele alliot-marie , who said europe needed a better organized force to deal with post-conflict security . " in all crises one notices that the purely military phase is systematically followed by a civilian-military phase , where the aspect of maintaining order becomes increasingly important , " said alliot-marie .
she , no doubt , has been paying attention to the situation in iraq . the gendarme force is the latest in a series initiatives related to eu defense matters .
many such proposals invariably prove controversial , with some arguing for more independent eu capabilities , while others fear the development of a so-called " euro army " will antagonize the us and duplicate - at great expense - the resources of nato . dw staff -lrb- ziw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato mulls eu defense plans eu defense ministers met in brussels last week to sell a european military planning unit independent of nato to a skeptical united states .

opponents say it is both elitist and barbaric , with a pack of dogs tracking a live animal and then tearing it apart . lords stalled original bill the commons has voted before for a total hunting ban , but opposition in the upper house of lords , rooted deeply in the land-owning aristocracy , stalled legislation long enough for it to die on the order paper . if it is blocked again , prime minister tony blair has vowed to employ the parliament act - a rarely-used law allowing him to override the opinion of the upper house - to overrule the lords and get the ban on the law books . the government has said any ban will not come into effect for two years , though that could be shortened to 18 months to please anti-hunt hardliners within the labor party .
the ban would apply in england and wales , after scotland 's autonomous parliament imposed a similar measure two years ago . fox hunting is one of britain 's most bitter political issues , with a great number of country dwellers in favor of the activity but the majority of parliament and people in general against it . it is a quintessential british country pastime going back many centuries in which noisy packs of hounds chase a fox over rolling countryside , followed by hunters in bright red jackets galloping on horseback .

" the place for anybody who disagrees with the ban on hunting , the place to make their point is not on the streets but through the ballot box , " said michael on bbc radio . " we are being a reasonable , moderate government , saying this issue has to be resolved , we promised to resolve it , and if we can only resolve it by the use of the parliament act , then that will be done .

the ban would apply in england and wales , after scotland 's autonomous parliament imposed a similar measure two years ago . fox hunting is one of britain 's most bitter political issues , with a great number of country dwellers in favor of the activity but the majority of parliament and people in general against it . it is a quintessential british country pastime going back many centuries in which noisy packs of hounds chase a fox over rolling countryside , followed by hunters in bright red jackets galloping on horseback .
the fox , if it fails to escape , is eventually cornered , killed and ripped apart by the excited dogs before someone comes with a plastic bag and takes its remains away for disposal . some government officials in favor britain 's vocal animal welfare movement , outraged by the obvious brutality of the sport , have called for a ban for years , and influential members and factions of blair 's own labor party want to see it done away with as well . the pro-hunt camp , on the other hand , has threatened civil disobedience if a ban goes ahead - a tactic that rural affairs minister alun michael called ill-advised .
" the place for anybody who disagrees with the ban on hunting , the place to make their point is not on the streets but through the ballot box , " said michael on bbc radio .

the study looked at 130 suicide notes left behind by people between 65 and 95 years old from 1995 to 2003 and also found most of the elderly who took their own lives also suffered from depression , dementia or chronic pain .
many older people are worried about the state of germany 's old people 's homes , reinhard linder , who has examined the phenomenon of elderly suicide in his work at the center for suicidal behavior studies in hamburg , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .
however germany will have to struggle to improve or even maintain the quality of its nursing homes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .
however germany will have to struggle to improve or even maintain the quality of its nursing homes .
the marburger association of doctors , an association of german hospital doctors , said it expected the number of people suffering from dementia to increase to 1.8 million people by 2010 . ralf lehnert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de increasing awareness for dementia as an international conference on alzheimer kicks off in philadelphia , germans are still struggling to figure out how to deal with the problem : most nursing homes are still ill-equipped to respond to patients needs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.09.2004 bright lights , big cities , no competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an expensive proposition : germany 's electricity grid germans have to dig deeper in their pockets to turn on lights , do a load of laundry , or heat their homes with electricity , than any other nation in europe . open markets and lower prices were the goals when the german electricity market was liberalized in 1999 .
today , electricity is 8 percent more expensive than it was before - the most costly in the european union .
a look at the pricing statistics of the energy information center in july 2004 makes it clear : a german household using 3500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year pays € 615 -lrb- $ 748 -rrb- , while in britain the same usage costs € 435 a year .
the finns got off the lightest , with a bill of € 370 .
in terms of europe-wide electricity prices for industrial users , germany came in at second place , behind italy .
and here is no lowering of prices in sight .
rather , the big energy providers , such as eon , vattenfall and rwe , want to increase electricity prices further .
warning : economy threatened this poses a danger to the german economy , said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin .
" energy intensive branches would be especially effected , for example the chemical sector , " she said .
especially now , when the germany economy is looking for an upswing , a price increase would be dubious , said kemfert .
" we hope that the big energy concerns consider the germany 's economic situation , and increase prices less than expected , " she said .
monopoly at fault electricity prices fell immediately following the liberalization of the electricity market four years ago .
but quickly thereafter , market tendencies such as mergers and takeovers in the energy industry led to increased electricity prices , kemfert said .
holger krawinkel , of the berlin consumer protection society said the current monopoly in germany 's energy sector is responsible for the high prices .
one important problem is the monopoly of the electricity grid .
energy producers have to pay high prices to use the grid .
a third of the net electricity cost can be attributed to fees for grid usage - with the usage tending to get more expensive , not less .
debate over regulation starting on jan .
1 , 2005 , the situation is expected to improve .
this past july , the german cabinet passed the energy economic law , establishing a regulatory body for the sector .
similar to the regulatory body for the telecommunication and postal services -lrb- regtp , -rrb- which it will be linked to , the new regulators should make sure there is fair competition on the german energy market .
the new body will differ from regtp in that it will be able to retrospectively control prices if they are shown to be abusive .
rather than celebrating the regulatory body , however , the consumer-advocate krawinkel said it is not a good idea .
" this so-called abuse oversight did n't work in the cartel office , and it is n't used by any other country , " he said .
only when a company is forced to provides in advance paperwork showing price approvals , can you assume they are complete , he added .
" if you want to try to fine the companies after the fact , they will naturally try to talk their way out of it , " krawinkel said .
" in our view , it just wo n't work . "
energy summit expected many german states demand prior examination and approval of electricity prices .
it is therefore questionable whether the regulatory body can actually begin its work at the beginning of the new year , as planned .
there will unquestionably be a gread deal of opposition in the bundesrat , the legislative body that represents the different states ' interests .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants to hold a summit meeting with representatives from the german energy industry , economy minister wolfgang clement , and environment minister jürgen trittin , in order to discuss the announced price increases .
however , an accord with the energy industry is unlikely , since the industry itself blames the higher prices on the government .
the electricity industry association -lrb- vdew -rrb- blames the situation on taxes and duties of up to 40 percent .
with price increases , the company could react to increased fuel prices and costs for promoting renewable energies , a vdew spokesperson told newspapers . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dung good germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .

but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen . take a peek inside the fruit and vegetable store where kahalid saeed aydin works , and it looks like turkey is already part of the european union .
he sells italian grapes and nectarines , spanish oranges and german apples .
in the refrigerated case by the cash register french and turkish sheep cheese soak in brine next to each other , on sale for the same price .
but the inside of the store in the western german city of koblenz is deceptive .
turkey is not part of the eu , but it 's been an official candidate for membership since 1999 .
an independent commission on turkey will report on its findings , which call the beginning of accession talks " politically imperative , " in vienna thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half the products kahalid saeed aydin sells come from turkey though generally not interested in politics , aydin -lrb- photo -rrb- said turkey joining the eu would be good , but would n't have a large effect on his own life , as he is " already in the eu . "
other turks in germany - who total 2.6 million and make up the country 's largest immigrant group - echo his feelings and wonder what concrete changes eu membership would have for them .
" what should change with the eu , " asked ibrahim tasar , the owner of three snack bars in bonn , who has lived in germany since 1992 .
" i have my business ; i can travel ; i work hard .
the eu wo n't change that . "
psychological changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish community is germany 's largest immigrant group observers of the german-turkish community agree that people with turkish roots living in germany will have to keep working hard , but some emotional changes could take place if the european council decides to start accession negotiations with ankara when it meets in december .
" people would have a sense of social recognition similar to that of germans or other minorities in germany - that 's the main motive behind their support , " dirk halm , a spokesman for the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university , told dw-world .
it 's emotional changes , not economic benefits , that most interest mustafa schat , head of the german-turkish economic center in cologne .
" it would change the discussions about turkish people in germany , " he said .
" i could say , ' we europeans . '
it would be clear to everyone that turkey belongs to europe . "
does turkey belong in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a place for a crescent in the europe 's star-filled flag ?
currently , not everyone in the eu agrees on turkey 's place in europe .
eu agriculture commissioner franz fischer has called turkey " much more oriental than european " and campaigned against starting negations with the country .
on the other hand , tasar , the snack bar owner , and the independent commission , affirm turkey is part of europe , with the report describing the country as a society oriented " toward europe and the west . "
already a key member of nato , part of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and playing in europe 's soccer scene , the eu is one of the only european organizations where turkey does not have a seat .
economic changes already happened about 75 percent of turkey 's 70 million people would vote to join the eu , mostly for economic reasons , according to the report .
but there would be few economic benefits for turkish people and businesses that have already put down their roots in germany .
germany has had an import-export deal with turkey since 1996 , which would decrease the economic effects of eu membership since there are n't many trade barriers now , center for studies on turkey spokesman halm said .
" our status as a partner has already brought a positive economic effect , " schat of the german-turkish economic center said .
" many turk-run companies here do n't rely on the turkish market or turkish goods . "
there could , however , be advantages for companies in the service , transport and tourism industries if turkey is admitted to the eu , he added .
reforms are key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion commissioner verheugen thinks 2015 is the earliest turkey could join the eu before any possible negotiations end , making turkey a full eu member , which could happen in 2015 " at the earliest , " according to european expansion commissioner günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , politicians want to be sure ankara is serious about its reforms - which the turkish-german community is also interested in .
members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "
in an effort to show europe it 's ready to begin talks , in the last two years turkey has passed laws increasing freedom of speech and reducing the role of the military , with the latest batch coming two weeks ago .
turkey is counting on receiving a date ; all of their reforms had the goal of getting them ready for the eu , halm said .
he expects the country to receive one from the european council in december .
" i think once turkey is admitted to the eu , people will ask themselves , ' why did n't we do this 10 years ago ? , " ' tasar said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 16.09.2004 back to domestic bundesliga business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart return from uefa cup duty in hungary to defend top spot the glitz and glamour of european competition makes way for domestic duties once more as germany 's represenatatives buckle down to the important business of winning the bundesliga .
here 's how week five shapes up . some bundesliga teams will return to action in week five fresh - and some not so fresh - from combative european competition in mid-week .
after the highs and lows of their champions league and uefa cup performances against teams like real madrid and inter milan , the german representatives will have to knuckle down once more for the domestic struggle for supremacy . after a trip to israel for their opening group stage game , the victorious players of bayern munich take the shorter journey to dortmund to take on bvb .
borussia dortmund were unlucky to lose a lead and eventually draw with bochum last weekend and will hope to keep their concentration against one of their biggest rivals when the bavarians arrive on saturday . bayern 's 1-0 win in the champions league may have restored a little stability and faith in a side teetering on the edge of an early season internal meltdown and if all the elements of their star-studded team are all pulling in the same direction , dortmund may have their hands full . buzzing bayer back to earth bayer leverkusen may still be on cloud nine by the time nuremberg come calling this weekend after dispatching the widely recognized " best team in the world " in their 3-0 european mid-week romp .
real madrid felt the cutting edge of klaus augenthaler 's rapier team and after losing an unbeaten 14 game streak to fsv mainz in week four , leverkusen will want to keep the momentum of wednesday night 's stunning win going in their domestic campaign . ninth place nuremberg floundered in the dullest game of the season so far last week , the 0-0 draw with an equally uninspiring berlin , and may not fancy dealing with a buoyant bayer .
however , nuremberg have had their moments this season and are not incapable of adding a second league defeat in a row to leverkusen . leverkusen 's conquerors mainz face arminia bielefeld away on saturday , looking down on their bottom of the league opponents from the lofty position of fourth spot .
both teams were promoted last season but things are now very different from how they were in the second bundesliga .
mainz , in their first ever season , are relishing their top flight soccer and have put in some great performances .
in-form mainz striker benni auer will be one bielefeld will have to watch as the home side attempt to keep the score down and chase some well needed points which could keep their solitary one company . stuttering champs need to settle nerves just above bottom placed bielefeld sit hanover 96 , visitors to stuttering champions werder bremen on saturday .
hanover are struggling at this early stage of the season and may be in two minds about the best course of action ahead of the weekend 's journey to bremen .
the champions are presenting a very schizophrenic image so far . hanover could struggle against the cavalier bremen team who are more than capable of turning over any team in the league on their day , or they could stand a decent chance of victory against the nervous werder side which has slipped to two consecutive league defeats and one loss in europe in the past three weeks . another team facing a crisis of confidence is schalke 04 who play host to borussia mönchengladbach at the weekend .
after waving goodbye to jupp heynckes , the manager-less and free-falling gelsenkirchen side will face mönchengladbach , werder bremen 's victors from week four , after an unpredictable visit to latvia in the uefa cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's marek heinz , celebrates after scroring against werder bremen .
mönchengladbach in tenth are on the up after languishing in the bottom section of the league for the first three weeks of the campaign , more than doubling their points total with last week 's win over the champions .
they could heap more misery on the rudderless royal blues as schalke 's season looks likely to get worse before it gets better . relegation-zone dog fights begin already kaiserslautern are hoping that their worst is over and that things are now getting better after recording their first points of the season last week with the 3-2 away win against hansa rostock .
the much-needed three points lifted kaiserslautern off the bottom of the league and up to a decidedly less dodgy 14th . on the way out of the relegation zone , they passed hamburg , their visitors on saturday , going in the opposite direction .
klaus toppmöller 's side had just managed to get themselves off the foot of the table a week before , passing the unenviable position to kaiserslautern , before losing to stuttgart in week four .

here 's how week five shapes up . some bundesliga teams will return to action in week five fresh - and some not so fresh - from combative european competition in mid-week .
after the highs and lows of their champions league and uefa cup performances against teams like real madrid and inter milan , the german representatives will have to knuckle down once more for the domestic struggle for supremacy . after a trip to israel for their opening group stage game , the victorious players of bayern munich take the shorter journey to dortmund to take on bvb .
borussia dortmund were unlucky to lose a lead and eventually draw with bochum last weekend and will hope to keep their concentration against one of their biggest rivals when the bavarians arrive on saturday . bayern 's 1-0 win in the champions league may have restored a little stability and faith in a side teetering on the edge of an early season internal meltdown and if all the elements of their star-studded team are all pulling in the same direction , dortmund may have their hands full . buzzing bayer back to earth bayer leverkusen may still be on cloud nine by the time nuremberg come calling this weekend after dispatching the widely recognized " best team in the world " in their 3-0 european mid-week romp .
real madrid felt the cutting edge of klaus augenthaler 's rapier team and after losing an unbeaten 14 game streak to fsv mainz in week four , leverkusen will want to keep the momentum of wednesday night 's stunning win going in their domestic campaign . ninth place nuremberg floundered in the dullest game of the season so far last week , the 0-0 draw with an equally uninspiring berlin , and may not fancy dealing with a buoyant bayer .
however , nuremberg have had their moments this season and are not incapable of adding a second league defeat in a row to leverkusen . leverkusen 's conquerors mainz face arminia bielefeld away on saturday , looking down on their bottom of the league opponents from the lofty position of fourth spot .
both teams were promoted last season but things are now very different from how they were in the second bundesliga .
mainz , in their first ever season , are relishing their top flight soccer and have put in some great performances .
in-form mainz striker benni auer will be one bielefeld will have to watch as the home side attempt to keep the score down and chase some well needed points which could keep their solitary one company . stuttering champs need to settle nerves just above bottom placed bielefeld sit hanover 96 , visitors to stuttering champions werder bremen on saturday .
hanover are struggling at this early stage of the season and may be in two minds about the best course of action ahead of the weekend 's journey to bremen .
the champions are presenting a very schizophrenic image so far . hanover could struggle against the cavalier bremen team who are more than capable of turning over any team in the league on their day , or they could stand a decent chance of victory against the nervous werder side which has slipped to two consecutive league defeats and one loss in europe in the past three weeks . another team facing a crisis of confidence is schalke 04 who play host to borussia mönchengladbach at the weekend .
after waving goodbye to jupp heynckes , the manager-less and free-falling gelsenkirchen side will face mönchengladbach , werder bremen 's victors from week four , after an unpredictable visit to latvia in the uefa cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's marek heinz , celebrates after scroring against werder bremen .
mönchengladbach in tenth are on the up after languishing in the bottom section of the league for the first three weeks of the campaign , more than doubling their points total with last week 's win over the champions .
they could heap more misery on the rudderless royal blues as schalke 's season looks likely to get worse before it gets better . relegation-zone dog fights begin already kaiserslautern are hoping that their worst is over and that things are now getting better after recording their first points of the season last week with the 3-2 away win against hansa rostock .
the much-needed three points lifted kaiserslautern off the bottom of the league and up to a decidedly less dodgy 14th . on the way out of the relegation zone , they passed hamburg , their visitors on saturday , going in the opposite direction .
klaus toppmöller 's side had just managed to get themselves off the foot of the table a week before , passing the unenviable position to kaiserslautern , before losing to stuttgart in week four .
both teams are on shaky ground and the game could go either way with neither safely away from the drop zone . the team just above both kaiserslautern and hamburg is hansa rostock who entertain one of the form teams at the moment , vfl wolfsburg .
wolfsburg have back-to-back wins over werder bremen and schalke 04 to keep the confidence flowing and will be looking for a third consecutive win to keep the pressure on stuttgart at the top of the league .

but that does n't keep them from hoping it will eventually happen . take a peek inside the fruit and vegetable store where kahalid saeed aydin works , and it looks like turkey is already part of the european union .
he sells italian grapes and nectarines , spanish oranges and german apples .
in the refrigerated case by the cash register french and turkish sheep cheese soak in brine next to each other , on sale for the same price .
but the inside of the store in the western german city of koblenz is deceptive .
turkey is not part of the eu , but it 's been an official candidate for membership since 1999 .
an independent commission on turkey will report on its findings , which call the beginning of accession talks " politically imperative , " in vienna thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about half the products kahalid saeed aydin sells come from turkey though generally not interested in politics , aydin -lrb- photo -rrb- said turkey joining the eu would be good , but would n't have a large effect on his own life , as he is " already in the eu . "
other turks in germany - who total 2.6 million and make up the country 's largest immigrant group - echo his feelings and wonder what concrete changes eu membership would have for them .
" what should change with the eu , " asked ibrahim tasar , the owner of three snack bars in bonn , who has lived in germany since 1992 .
" i have my business ; i can travel ; i work hard .
the eu wo n't change that . "
psychological changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish community is germany 's largest immigrant group observers of the german-turkish community agree that people with turkish roots living in germany will have to keep working hard , but some emotional changes could take place if the european council decides to start accession negotiations with ankara when it meets in december .
" people would have a sense of social recognition similar to that of germans or other minorities in germany - that 's the main motive behind their support , " dirk halm , a spokesman for the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university , told dw-world .
it 's emotional changes , not economic benefits , that most interest mustafa schat , head of the german-turkish economic center in cologne .
" it would change the discussions about turkish people in germany , " he said .
" i could say , ' we europeans . '
it would be clear to everyone that turkey belongs to europe . "
does turkey belong in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a place for a crescent in the europe 's star-filled flag ?
currently , not everyone in the eu agrees on turkey 's place in europe .
eu agriculture commissioner franz fischer has called turkey " much more oriental than european " and campaigned against starting negations with the country .
on the other hand , tasar , the snack bar owner , and the independent commission , affirm turkey is part of europe , with the report describing the country as a society oriented " toward europe and the west . "
already a key member of nato , part of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and playing in europe 's soccer scene , the eu is one of the only european organizations where turkey does not have a seat .
economic changes already happened about 75 percent of turkey 's 70 million people would vote to join the eu , mostly for economic reasons , according to the report .
but there would be few economic benefits for turkish people and businesses that have already put down their roots in germany .
germany has had an import-export deal with turkey since 1996 , which would decrease the economic effects of eu membership since there are n't many trade barriers now , center for studies on turkey spokesman halm said .
" our status as a partner has already brought a positive economic effect , " schat of the german-turkish economic center said .
" many turk-run companies here do n't rely on the turkish market or turkish goods . "
there could , however , be advantages for companies in the service , transport and tourism industries if turkey is admitted to the eu , he added .
reforms are key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion commissioner verheugen thinks 2015 is the earliest turkey could join the eu before any possible negotiations end , making turkey a full eu member , which could happen in 2015 " at the earliest , " according to european expansion commissioner günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , politicians want to be sure ankara is serious about its reforms - which the turkish-german community is also interested in .
members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "
in an effort to show europe it 's ready to begin talks , in the last two years turkey has passed laws increasing freedom of speech and reducing the role of the military , with the latest batch coming two weeks ago .
turkey is counting on receiving a date ; all of their reforms had the goal of getting them ready for the eu , halm said .
he expects the country to receive one from the european council in december .
" i think once turkey is admitted to the eu , people will ask themselves , ' why did n't we do this 10 years ago ? , " ' tasar said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "
the modern-day homesteaders , however , certainly do n't have farming or ranching in mind . kristine ziwica send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a perfect place for artists a new cultural concept in the western german town of essen offers artists free space and inspiration to work on their projects .

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "

" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "

today , electricity is 8 percent more expensive than it was before - the most costly in the european union .
a look at the pricing statistics of the energy information center in july 2004 makes it clear : a german household using 3500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year pays € 615 -lrb- $ 748 -rrb- , while in britain the same usage costs € 435 a year .
the finns got off the lightest , with a bill of € 370 .
in terms of europe-wide electricity prices for industrial users , germany came in at second place , behind italy .
and here is no lowering of prices in sight .
rather , the big energy providers , such as eon , vattenfall and rwe , want to increase electricity prices further .
warning : economy threatened this poses a danger to the german economy , said claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- in berlin .
" energy intensive branches would be especially effected , for example the chemical sector , " she said .
especially now , when the germany economy is looking for an upswing , a price increase would be dubious , said kemfert .
" we hope that the big energy concerns consider the germany 's economic situation , and increase prices less than expected , " she said .
monopoly at fault electricity prices fell immediately following the liberalization of the electricity market four years ago .
but quickly thereafter , market tendencies such as mergers and takeovers in the energy industry led to increased electricity prices , kemfert said .
holger krawinkel , of the berlin consumer protection society said the current monopoly in germany 's energy sector is responsible for the high prices .
one important problem is the monopoly of the electricity grid .
energy producers have to pay high prices to use the grid .
a third of the net electricity cost can be attributed to fees for grid usage - with the usage tending to get more expensive , not less .
debate over regulation starting on jan .
1 , 2005 , the situation is expected to improve .
this past july , the german cabinet passed the energy economic law , establishing a regulatory body for the sector .
similar to the regulatory body for the telecommunication and postal services -lrb- regtp , -rrb- which it will be linked to , the new regulators should make sure there is fair competition on the german energy market .
the new body will differ from regtp in that it will be able to retrospectively control prices if they are shown to be abusive .
rather than celebrating the regulatory body , however , the consumer-advocate krawinkel said it is not a good idea .
" this so-called abuse oversight did n't work in the cartel office , and it is n't used by any other country , " he said .
only when a company is forced to provides in advance paperwork showing price approvals , can you assume they are complete , he added .
" if you want to try to fine the companies after the fact , they will naturally try to talk their way out of it , " krawinkel said .
" in our view , it just wo n't work . "
energy summit expected many german states demand prior examination and approval of electricity prices .
it is therefore questionable whether the regulatory body can actually begin its work at the beginning of the new year , as planned .
there will unquestionably be a gread deal of opposition in the bundesrat , the legislative body that represents the different states ' interests .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has said he wants to hold a summit meeting with representatives from the german energy industry , economy minister wolfgang clement , and environment minister jürgen trittin , in order to discuss the announced price increases .
however , an accord with the energy industry is unlikely , since the industry itself blames the higher prices on the government .
the electricity industry association -lrb- vdew -rrb- blames the situation on taxes and duties of up to 40 percent .
with price increases , the company could react to increased fuel prices and costs for promoting renewable energies , a vdew spokesperson told newspapers . christine harjes -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dung good germany wants to increase its use of renewable energies for electricity production to 12.5 percent by 2010 .

the study looked at 130 suicide notes left behind by people between 65 and 95 years old from 1995 to 2003 and also found most of the elderly who took their own lives also suffered from depression , dementia or chronic pain .
many older people are worried about the state of germany 's old people 's homes , reinhard linder , who has examined the phenomenon of elderly suicide in his work at the center for suicidal behavior studies in hamburg , told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's population is growing older and older in 2002 , there were 3,534 people over 65 who took their own lives , a increase of 5 percent , the german newsmagazine focus reported .
linder , however , warned people not to equate the condition of germany 's elderly homes with senior suicide .
" it is not possible to say there is a bad situation in old people 's homes , and therefore old people kill themselves , " he said .
the study revealed that elderly people often get better care at old people 's homes than family members could provide .
but for many older germans leaving home and moving into communal living arrangements is equivalent to losing their independence , a feeling many elderly have never experienced and are unprepared for , linder said .
politicians moving in to help helping the elderly realize they can manage their new dependency and continue living fulfilling lives has become a political issue in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : often care in an old people 's home is better than what family members could provide politicians and civic groups seized on the berlin study as evidence of the " catastrophic care situation in germany " and pleaded for better quality controls for the 600,000 people , mostly over 80 years old , living in care facilities .
in recent years , repeated reports of overworked staff and willful neglect of patients have alarmed germans .
even though lindner called these conclusions much too simple , he admitted the state of nursing homes could have an effect on the suicide rate .
" it is much more complicated , but one can say that good old people ’ s homes which are caring for their people in a good way are a suicide protective factor , " he said .
however germany will have to struggle to improve or even maintain the quality of its nursing homes .
the marburger association of doctors , an association of german hospital doctors , said it expected the number of people suffering from dementia to increase to 1.8 million people by 2010 . ralf lehnert -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de increasing awareness for dementia as an international conference on alzheimer kicks off in philadelphia , germans are still struggling to figure out how to deal with the problem : most nursing homes are still ill-equipped to respond to patients needs .

ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .
" town for sale " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sign in the gas station window indicated the town was for sale .
so how does one go about purchasing an entire town ?
it 's surprisingly easy , bardorff told dw-world .
six years ago , on one of his frequent cross-country road trips , bardorff came upon the ghost town and could n't help noticing the " town for sale " sign in the window of the gas station .
an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "

an idea was born : bardorff returned to frankfurt and convinced two of his friends , gloser and mörchen , to help him cobble together the very affordable $ 20,000 -lrb- € 16,300 -rrb- purchase price .
in october 2001 , bardorff and company became the proud owners of the lobo , which means wolf in spanish .
to the germans , lobo also has another meaning : it 's short for " low-life bohemian . "
located in the desert-like no-man 's land in the region of texas bordering mexico , lobo came with a gas station , motel , general store / post office and five other buildings , all in a terrible state of repair .
now , the lobo collective , whose numbers have since grown from three to 15 , are still transforming the town into what can best be described as an art-cum-chill-out space .
they even held a " town-warming " party last summer , to which they invited neighbors from miles around and served good-old-fashioned german culinary classics , including bratwurst , potato salad and pretzels .
trying to keep a low-profile but despite events like last may 's fiesta , the " lobonitos , " as they like to call themselves , say they do n't have a master plan .
ask about a vision , and they say there is n't one .
bardorff stressed that this was n't a " commercial venture . "
" we do n't want to sell anything , we do n't want to rent anything , lobo is not an artists ' retreat , " said bardorff .
in short , it 's just a place for people - be they writers , artists , musicians or ...
it specialists - to hang out in the desert and do what they want .
forget bobos , here come the lobos !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lobo founders say they want to keep a low profile .
however , the lobo web site tells a slightly different story .
there , a manifesto of sorts - authored by none other than bardorff himself - was posted .
in a piece entitled " lowlife bohemians vs. bourgeois bohemians , " he explained the origins of the lobo name .
bardorff referred to " bobos , " short for " bohemian bourgeois , " a class christened by writer david brooks in his book , " bobos in paradise . "
bobos , wrote bardorff , " leach off the cultural environment created by others . "
lobos , in contrast , " want to restore and revive through their own efforts , actively participating and contributing to the cultural life of their communities .
they do n't mind eating macaroni and cheese and prefer drinking coffee from an old percolator to a triple mocha latte . "
not a " latte town " perhaps bardorff is afraid lobo will share the same fate of places like lambertville , new jersey , silver city , maryland , and - nearby in texas - marfa .
all were founded in the 1970s and 80s by people looking for an alternative to conventional urban centers .
marfa , for example , was the brain-child of american artist donald judd .
and all the aforementioned eventually suffered from a second wave of affluent gentrification .
along with money and rising real estate prices , the new residents brought posh bed and breakfasts , restaurants and coffee shops - turning these places into what bardorff disparagingly called " latte towns . "
lobo is meant to eventually function as an antidote and refuge for those belonging to the " lobo " creed .
for a group that claims to have no master plan , a carefully crafted ideology certainly underpins this project .
trading german order for the wild west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette gloser , in the motel 's empty pool , has found creative freedom in lobo .
for curator annette gloser , taking-up part-time residence in the texas desert also holds the promise of a freedom she found lacking in germany .
a fixture in the frankfurt art scene and well-known for her impromptu happenings in abandoned and found spaces around her native city , gloser has dealt with her fair share of zoning and planning restrictions .
in lobo , no one is bothered by what she does .
" i can build and make what i want , " gloser told dw-world .
" in frankfurt , i ca n't even change something in my garden without getting permission . "
in fact , her texan neighbors have been surprisingly easy-going , said gloser .
in a region so far away from everything , politics does n't get much lip service .
so germans , despite their chancellor 's decision to stay out of the war in iraq , are welcome here , bardorff said .
" maybe they talk about the weather , but they never told about politics , " he said .
an avant-garde " german belt " ?
the collective of germans affiliated with the lobo project are not the first wave of german immigrants to take up residence in texas .
in a way , they are the avant-garde successors of the thousands of germans who came to texas between 1845 and 1900 .
in 1842 , a group of noblemen formed the mainzer adelsverein , better known as the society for the protection of german immigrants in texas , and purchased tracts of land which they later turned over to german homesteaders .
thus , towns like fredericksburg , new braunfels and boerne , just north and west of the city of austin , formed the heart of what is today called the " german belt . "

not put-off by the state of transatlantic relations , they 're turning the hamlet into an art-cum-chill-out space . three years ago , alexander bardorff , the former manager of a popular frankfurt restaurant , joined forces with two other germans to purchase an abandoned town in texas .
ever since then , bardorff and his partners , annette gloser , a curator famous for her free-form art happenings in frankfurt , and claus-peter mörchen , an it specialist , have been hard at work turning it into a mecca for alternative teutonic types they like to call " lobos . "
lobo - not surprisingly - is also the name of their oasis in the texan chihuahua desert .
and though events in the middle east have slightly soured german-american relations , these modern-day european pioneers to a state so closely associated with us president george w. bush wo n't be put off .
as cultural ambassadors , they have a message of their own , even if they wo n't admit it .

psychological changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish community is germany 's largest immigrant group observers of the german-turkish community agree that people with turkish roots living in germany will have to keep working hard , but some emotional changes could take place if the european council decides to start accession negotiations with ankara when it meets in december .
" people would have a sense of social recognition similar to that of germans or other minorities in germany - that 's the main motive behind their support , " dirk halm , a spokesman for the center for studies on turkey at duisburg-essen university , told dw-world .
it 's emotional changes , not economic benefits , that most interest mustafa schat , head of the german-turkish economic center in cologne .
" it would change the discussions about turkish people in germany , " he said .
" i could say , ' we europeans . '
it would be clear to everyone that turkey belongs to europe . "
does turkey belong in europe ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is there a place for a crescent in the europe 's star-filled flag ?
currently , not everyone in the eu agrees on turkey 's place in europe .
eu agriculture commissioner franz fischer has called turkey " much more oriental than european " and campaigned against starting negations with the country .
on the other hand , tasar , the snack bar owner , and the independent commission , affirm turkey is part of europe , with the report describing the country as a society oriented " toward europe and the west . "
already a key member of nato , part of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- and playing in europe 's soccer scene , the eu is one of the only european organizations where turkey does not have a seat .
economic changes already happened about 75 percent of turkey 's 70 million people would vote to join the eu , mostly for economic reasons , according to the report .
but there would be few economic benefits for turkish people and businesses that have already put down their roots in germany .
germany has had an import-export deal with turkey since 1996 , which would decrease the economic effects of eu membership since there are n't many trade barriers now , center for studies on turkey spokesman halm said .
" our status as a partner has already brought a positive economic effect , " schat of the german-turkish economic center said .
" many turk-run companies here do n't rely on the turkish market or turkish goods . "
there could , however , be advantages for companies in the service , transport and tourism industries if turkey is admitted to the eu , he added .
reforms are key bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expansion commissioner verheugen thinks 2015 is the earliest turkey could join the eu before any possible negotiations end , making turkey a full eu member , which could happen in 2015 " at the earliest , " according to european expansion commissioner günter verheugen -lrb- photo -rrb- , politicians want to be sure ankara is serious about its reforms - which the turkish-german community is also interested in .
members of the community are especially keen on seeing turkey 's reforms continue , as their families are directly affected .
" it is going to be a much bigger change for the people in turkey than for the turkish people in germany , " tasar said .
" turkey still has problems - for example , with the kurds - that it needs to solve before it can join the eu . "
in an effort to show europe it 's ready to begin talks , in the last two years turkey has passed laws increasing freedom of speech and reducing the role of the military , with the latest batch coming two weeks ago .
turkey is counting on receiving a date ; all of their reforms had the goal of getting them ready for the eu , halm said .
he expects the country to receive one from the european council in december .
" i think once turkey is admitted to the eu , people will ask themselves , ' why did n't we do this 10 years ago ? , " ' tasar said . sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey backs down on adultery law under huge pressure from the european union , turkey back-pedaled away from a bill to re-criminalize adultery on tuesday .

it is the latest move by the environment agency to help boost stocks in river in the region .
the young salmon , which are only a few inches long , are being brought down from wales where they have been reared at the agency 's hatchery .
known as fingerlings , the fish were born from adult salmon which were trapped last autumn .
the salmon will be kept in the fish-rearing ponds where they will continue to grow and develop throughout the winter .
the environment agency says the measure will increase the salmons ' chances of survival when they are released into the river next spring .
the river otter and the river culm , also in east devon , will receive any surplus young salmon .
andrew locke , of the environment agency , is confident the attempt will work .
he said : " the survival rate of young fish reared at the hatchery in wales has been very good this year . "

in march , 550 jobs were cut when the agency lost out to the raf in the fight for a lucrative repair contract .
now labour mp john smith says another key contract could go to the raf , possibly risking hundreds more jobs .
the findings of a review into the future of the site are due to be released later .
the ministry of defence said that they were not able to comment until then .
following a meeting with armed forces minister adam ingram , mr smith , the vale of glamorgan mp , said he was " not very optimistic at all " about the expected statement .
he fears work on the tornado fighter will be lost , threatening jobs at the site . "
the effect will be devastating and i choose that word carefully " john smith mp mr smith added : " it is my fear that the government is going to take the wrong decision on this .
wrong in principle and wrong in practice .
" wrong for the royal air force , wrong for st athan and wrong for the welsh economy .
" even at this eleventh hour i ask them to think very carefully about what they 're going to announce tomorrow . "
the uk government agency , which is a civilian arm of the ministry of defence set up to cut the costs of maintaining and repairing the uk 's military aircraft , currently employs 2,000 people at st athan .
it has four sites in the uk , employing a total of 3,800 highly-skilled aviation engineers .
raf st athan is the main base and accounts for more than half of dara 's employees .
most of the job losses announced in march were down to a decision to upgrade harrier jump-jets " in-house " by the raf at its base at cottesmore in leicestershire , instead of st athan .
but now it is feared the next contract , to conduct extensive maintenance of the raf 's fleet of tornado fighter jets , could be lost - an even bigger deal than the harrier upgrade contract .
this could effect project red dragon , the welsh development agency -lrb- wda -rrb- plan to create a world-class aviation centre there .
but mr smith said he believed " common sense " would " prevail in the end " .
" this is the economics of the mad house , " he said .
" the front line fighter fleet of the royal air force has been serviced and maintained successfully to the highest standard in the world in south wales since the second world war .
i think we should be clear about this .
" the effect will be devastating and i choose that word carefully .
the military have been such an important component of the aerospace industry in south wales . "
jack dromey , deputy general secretary of the transport and general workers union , said he feared the worst .
" and that might put at risk project red dragon , which we fought for very hard indeed , " he said .
" i think the government is listening too much to vested interest within the armed forces .
for years the government has said it does not want to tie up military personnel serving their own aircraft , but instead to have highly skilled civilians doing that for them .
" now it would appear that the government is reversing that and giving back work to the raf .
" we do n't think that makes any sense , " he added .

the uk government agency , which is a civilian arm of the ministry of defence set up to cut the costs of maintaining and repairing the uk 's military aircraft , currently employs 2,000 people at st athan .
it has four sites in the uk , employing a total of 3,800 highly-skilled aviation engineers .
raf st athan is the main base and accounts for more than half of dara 's employees .
most of the job losses announced in march were down to a decision to upgrade harrier jump-jets " in-house " by the raf at its base at cottesmore in leicestershire , instead of st athan .
there are more than 2,000 dara workers at raf st athan but now it is feared the next contract , to conduct extensive maintenance of the raf 's fleet of tornado fighter jets , could be lost - an even bigger deal than the harrier upgrade contract .
this could effect project red dragon , the welsh development agency -lrb- wda -rrb- plan to create a world-class aviation centre there .

the findings of a review into the future of the site are due to be released later .
the ministry of defence said that they were not able to comment until then .

one of the main areas involved is the same as that used to learn fears in the first place , experiments by the new york university team showed .
this brain region for ' forgetting ' fears - the amygdala - had already been found in animals but not in humans .
the findings may help doctors better treat phobias , hope the authors of the study appearing in the journal neuron .
now we can all start to look at different things we can try in terms of treatment lead researcher dr elizabeth phelps there has been a great deal of research into how fears are learned and how they can be treated , but far less research into understanding how fears are naturally diminished .
for example , children can be afraid of the dark when they are young but grow out of this fear .
dr elizabeth phelps and colleagues used magnetic resonance imaging to look at what happens in the brain as fears are " unlearned " .
they " taught " volunteers to associate seeing an image of a coloured square with a mild electric shock .
how we forget this created a " conditional " fear , similar to a phobia , in which seeing the coloured square would produce mild anxiety .
the researchers then reversed this fear by presenting the same coloured square previously associated with the shock , but with smaller and smaller shocks until no shock followed the image .
when they looked at the brain scans they saw the amygdala was active when the fear was being learned , which was to be expected from previous research .
the amygdala was also active when the volunteers were " unlearning " their fear , along with another part of the brain called the ventral medial prefrontal cortex .

homes , schools and offices had already been demolished to make way for the route expansion .
community leaders , business people and politicians from all parties joined together on thursday afternoon for metrolink 's ' big noise . '

the role was created in the middle ages and then , as now , reports directly to the commons speaker .
sir michael and his staff of officials have a uniform of knee breeches and swords , which appear to many as quaint throwbacks to a previous age .
they certainly appear out of place and probably inadequate when compared to the machine gun wielding police officers who patrol the precincts and search visitors to the palace .
reports they were about to be replaced by a new security force have so far proved unfounded .
but wednesday 's security breach - the most serious in living memory - is certain to spark calls for this ancient arrangement to be brought to an end , in favour of something more modern .
a group of hunt protesters stormed into the commons chamber shortly after 1620bst to face ministers eyeball to eyeball and scream abuse at them .
the security staff - wearing their traditional black tails and at least one sporting a sword - did stop three protesters and quickly wrestled the five who broke into the chamber to the ground and out of the chamber as mps looked on in shocked disbelief .
but the five who made it to heart of british democracy were there long enough to have caused deaths or serious injury had they been determined to do so .
this was a far more serious and dangerous security breach than the recent purple powder attack on tony blair which stunned westminster earlier in the year .
that attack led to a comprehensive security review which is still on-going , and the erection of a bullet proof screen between mps and the public .
first invasion yet all those new arrangements failed .
had the protestors been terrorists the outcome could have been devastating .
some claimed it was the first invasion of the chamber since charles i. it raised questions over precisely how the protesters got into the building and then into the highly secure area where only mps are supposed to have access .
some mps - including tory tim yeo and labour 's clare ward , who was in the chamber at the time of the protest , suggested the demonstrators must have been given access by someone .
mrs ward called for an inquiry to find the alleged culprit , adding " we need to know because quite frankly it is unacceptable " .
the previous attack on the prime minister had already placed the organisation of security in the palace of westminster under intense scrutiny .
terrorist attack but commons leader peter hain has admitted security in the building is out of date and in need of a thorough overhaul and modernisation .
the parliamentary authorities have been taking advice from mi5 in recent months about the terror threat but there is no suggestion so far that such outside authorities should take over security in the palace of westminster .
the metropolitan police would , however , take over in the event of an emergency situation such as a full-blown terrorist attack .
there are already armed officers placed throughout the building but , understandably , much of the security is secret and unseen and the authorities refuse to discuss it openly .
what is well-known is that members of the public have to pass through airport-style security checks to get into the parliament buildings .
it is a long-held tradition , one much prized , that people can then stroll to central lobby to lobby their local mp .
however there are a myriad of corridors and rules about who can and can not go any further - which boil down to a basic rule that no-one can go further unless accompanied by someone with an official security-approved pass .
the latest breach raises fresh questions over whether the internal security really is efficient and well enough equipped to handle the task of protecting the palace of westminster .
some senior police officers are known to believe it is time they were charged with that task .
similarly there have been suggestions that the security services like mi5 should takeover at least some responsibility for security .
all these issues will now be raised again and it is certain that more draconian security measures will be an almost inevitable consequence of this latest breach .

the role was created in the middle ages and then , as now , reports directly to the commons speaker .
sir michael and his staff of officials have a uniform of knee breeches and swords , which appear to many as quaint throwbacks to a previous age .
they certainly appear out of place and probably inadequate when compared to the machine gun wielding police officers who patrol the precincts and search visitors to the palace .
reports they were about to be replaced by a new security force have so far proved unfounded .
but wednesday 's security breach - the most serious in living memory - is certain to spark calls for this ancient arrangement to be brought to an end , in favour of something more modern .
a group of hunt protesters stormed into the commons chamber shortly after 1620bst to face ministers eyeball to eyeball and scream abuse at them .
the security staff - wearing their traditional black tails and at least one sporting a sword - did stop three protesters and quickly wrestled the five who broke into the chamber to the ground and out of the chamber as mps looked on in shocked disbelief .
but the five who made it to heart of british democracy were there long enough to have caused deaths or serious injury had they been determined to do so .
this was a far more serious and dangerous security breach than the recent purple powder attack on tony blair which stunned westminster earlier in the year .
that attack led to a comprehensive security review which is still on-going , and the erection of a bullet proof screen between mps and the public .
first invasion yet all those new arrangements failed .
had the protestors been terrorists the outcome could have been devastating .
some claimed it was the first invasion of the chamber since charles i. flour attack sparked clampdown it raised questions over precisely how the protesters got into the building and then into the highly secure area where only mps are supposed to have access .
some mps - including tory tim yeo and labour 's clare ward , who was in the chamber at the time of the protest , suggested the demonstrators must have been given access by someone .
mrs ward called for an inquiry to find the alleged culprit , adding " we need to know because quite frankly it is unacceptable " .
the previous attack on the prime minister had already placed the organisation of security in the palace of westminster under intense scrutiny .
terrorist attack but commons leader peter hain has admitted security in the building is out of date and in need of a thorough overhaul and modernisation .
the parliamentary authorities have been taking advice from mi5 in recent months about the terror threat but there is no suggestion so far that such outside authorities should take over security in the palace of westminster .
the metropolitan police would , however , take over in the event of an emergency situation such as a full-blown terrorist attack .
there are already armed officers placed throughout the building but , understandably , much of the security is secret and unseen and the authorities refuse to discuss it openly .
protests erupted into violence what is well-known is that members of the public have to pass through airport-style security checks to get into the parliament buildings .
it is a long-held tradition , one much prized , that people can then stroll to central lobby to lobby their local mp .
however there are a myriad of corridors and rules about who can and can not go any further - which boil down to a basic rule that no-one can go further unless accompanied by someone with an official security-approved pass .
the latest breach raises fresh questions over whether the internal security really is efficient and well enough equipped to handle the task of protecting the palace of westminster .
some senior police officers are known to believe it is time they were charged with that task .
similarly there have been suggestions that the security services like mi5 should takeover at least some responsibility for security .
all these issues will now be raised again and it is certain that more draconian security measures will be an almost inevitable consequence of this latest breach .
