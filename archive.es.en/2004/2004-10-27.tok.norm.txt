" claudio is very important for us and we have missed him , " admitted bayern coach felix magath .
" he can hold the ball up and we play a lot better with him in the team . " bayern playmaker michael ballack was forced to watch from the stands along with his fellow german international sebastian deisler , who is recovering from his relapse into depression .
their absence handed a chance to teenager bastian schweinsteiger , 19 , and he grabbed it with both hands . young blood drives bayern on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's bastian schweinsteiger was in outsatnding form against wolfsburg .
in the ninth minute schweinsteiger - who was one of the few germans to impress at euro 2004 - produced a powerful drive from 25 yards and it took a fine save from simon jentzsch to push the effort onto the crossbar .
it was a warning that wolfsburg failed to heed , and a rampaging run from the effervescent schweinsteiger created the opening goal on 24 minutes . he ghosted past two defenders before a clever reverse pass played in pizarro to slot home .
" schweinsteiger produced a brilliant pass and i just had to slot it in , " said match hero pizarro . it was the peruvian international 's first goal of the season , and his second - when he nudged home an owen hargreaves cross on the chime of half-time - helped ease the pain of his recent injuries .

" nine points from ten bundesliga matches and getting knocked out of the cup is not good enough , " explained gladbach president rolf konigs . coaching duties in the meantime will fall to mönchengladbach 's amateur team coach horst küppel , who will lead the seniors out for an acid test of his man motivation skills at home against bayern munich this weekend . fach is the third managerial casualty of the current season following hamburg 's sacking of klaus toppmöller ten days ago and jupp heynckes ' forced departure from schalke 04 in mid-september .
ironically former gladbach star heynckes is now being touted for the vacant job . depression rife claims berlin defender hertha berlin defender josip simunic claims almost half of the players in the bundesliga struggle to cope with the pressure that leads to the depressive state his former team-mate sebastian deisler is in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler 's case is not an isolated one , claims simunic .
bayern munich midfielder deisler , 24 , was readmitted to the max-planck-institute for psychiatry on tuesday and croatian international simunic believes the pressure affects a lot more players . " many professional footballers can not cope with the pressure , " simunic told daily bild .
" i would say every second player in the bundesliga has problems but are too afraid to admit them .
football is about having a clear head and deisler does not have that at the moment . " simunic , 24 , played with deisler for two seasons at hertha and himself suffered from depression when he was at sv hamburg in 1999 .
" i wanted to pack football in , " confessed simunic .
" i was depressed and physically at my lowest level .
at one stage i went a whole week without sleeping . " cologne slap prince-ly sum on podolski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince could attract a king 's ransom in transfer fees .
germany 's 19-year-old international striker lukas podolski has had a staggering € 20 million -lrb- $ 25.5 million -rrb- price-tag placed on his head by his german club cologne . podolski recently claimed he would leave cologne if they did not win promotion to the bundesliga this season but the club are not willing to let ' prince podolski ' leave the rheinenergie stadium , not even for a king 's ransom .
" this jewel is not for sale even at 20 million euros , " said cologne president wolfgang overath . podolski , capped five times by germany , is contracted at cologne until 2007 and the club insist there are no get-out clauses .
he scored seven goals in the final eight bundesliga matches last season and has netted eight times in nine league outings this term to head the german second division scoring charts . fahrenhorst faces extended lay-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank fahrenhorst will be missing from the champions ' defense for longer than expected .
werder bremen defender frank fahrenhorst is suffering from a severe ankle injury which will keep him out of action for an undisclosed period , the german champions reported tuesday . the 27-year-old german international 's injury was first spotted around 10 days ago in training but tests have revealed it is more serious than initial indications suggested .

" nine points from ten bundesliga matches and getting knocked out of the cup is not good enough , " explained gladbach president rolf konigs . coaching duties in the meantime will fall to mönchengladbach 's amateur team coach horst küppel , who will lead the seniors out for an acid test of his man motivation skills at home against bayern munich this weekend . fach is the third managerial casualty of the current season following hamburg 's sacking of klaus toppmöller ten days ago and jupp heynckes ' forced departure from schalke 04 in mid-september .
ironically former gladbach star heynckes is now being touted for the vacant job . depression rife claims berlin defender hertha berlin defender josip simunic claims almost half of the players in the bundesliga struggle to cope with the pressure that leads to the depressive state his former team-mate sebastian deisler is in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler 's case is not an isolated one , claims simunic .
bayern munich midfielder deisler , 24 , was readmitted to the max-planck-institute for psychiatry on tuesday and croatian international simunic believes the pressure affects a lot more players . " many professional footballers can not cope with the pressure , " simunic told daily bild .
" i would say every second player in the bundesliga has problems but are too afraid to admit them .
football is about having a clear head and deisler does not have that at the moment . " simunic , 24 , played with deisler for two seasons at hertha and himself suffered from depression when he was at sv hamburg in 1999 .
" i wanted to pack football in , " confessed simunic .
" i was depressed and physically at my lowest level .
at one stage i went a whole week without sleeping . " cologne slap prince-ly sum on podolski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince could attract a king 's ransom in transfer fees .
germany 's 19-year-old international striker lukas podolski has had a staggering € 20 million -lrb- $ 25.5 million -rrb- price-tag placed on his head by his german club cologne . podolski recently claimed he would leave cologne if they did not win promotion to the bundesliga this season but the club are not willing to let ' prince podolski ' leave the rheinenergie stadium , not even for a king 's ransom .
" this jewel is not for sale even at 20 million euros , " said cologne president wolfgang overath . podolski , capped five times by germany , is contracted at cologne until 2007 and the club insist there are no get-out clauses .
he scored seven goals in the final eight bundesliga matches last season and has netted eight times in nine league outings this term to head the german second division scoring charts . fahrenhorst faces extended lay-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank fahrenhorst will be missing from the champions ' defense for longer than expected .
werder bremen defender frank fahrenhorst is suffering from a severe ankle injury which will keep him out of action for an undisclosed period , the german champions reported tuesday . the 27-year-old german international 's injury was first spotted around 10 days ago in training but tests have revealed it is more serious than initial indications suggested .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 27.10.2004 bild backs bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild believes bush will be better for germany europe 's top-selling newspaper , the german tabloid bild , endorsed george w. bush for us president tuesday , saying he would do a better job fighting terror and would n't ask berlin to send troops to iraq . germany 's bild zeitung deemed bush a known quantity in europe , and said he had a better sense than democratic challenger john kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the editorial , echoing sentiments expressed by others as well . " thus he will not request a contribution , " the former publisher of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung continued .
" but kerry would do just that - and add a further burden to the already damaged german-american relationship , " he added in what a spokesman said was likely the first us election endorsement in bild 's 51-year history . germany 's center-left government fiercely opposed the war in iraq and has refused to send soldiers to lighten the load on the us-led coalition . " bush has learned his lesson " the conservative daily said the incumbent president now knew from his experiences in iraq that he needed the support of a broad base of partners and would foster those alliances more than in his first term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and george w. bush in sept .
2003 " bush has learned that america can conquer any country militarily but can not win the peace by going it alone , " he said .
" that is why he will focus more on international cooperation in his second term . " the tabloid said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . " bush has learned the lessons of history , " the editorial read .
" good words do not help against violent fanatics , only military strength .
with him , as opposed to kerry , there is no waffling . with bush , we know what to expect .
no one knows what john kerry stands for and where he wants to lead america - and the world . " most germans believe in kerry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential nominee john kerry with his wife , terea and , vice presidential candidate john edwards the endorsement for bush by the german daily follows an editorial tuesday in europe 's biggest financial newspaper the financial times backing kerry . meanwhile a poll for stern weekly magazine to be published thursday showed that a clear majority of germans believe kerry will win the nov .

after rejecting the idea of tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help bring the german public deficit back within eu limits , berlin is now considering dipping into the financial reserves of the mandatory state nursing care insurance fund , die welt said on wednesday , without revealing its sources .
from its cash pile of € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , the nursing care insurance fund would make available an interest-free loan to the state-run health insurers who would use the cash to cut their debt and lower their premiums , the paper said .
the health insurers ' debt is included in the public budget , while the financial surplus of the nursing care insurance fund is not .
finance minister hans eichel is seeking ways of ensuring that the german public deficit next year falls back below 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- as required by the european stability and growth pact .

with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .
a defeat would not be so drastic in terms of placings with the two opponents swapping places .
either would see arminia in a not too disgraceful a position . unlike hamburg sv who currently find themselves playing the role of pale imitations of the european champions they once were .
despite raising their game to beat a shoddy borussia dortmund side 2-0 at the weekend , hamburg are still in a bad way in the third relegation spot with nine points from as many games . hamburg prepare drop-zone exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez could celebrate again if hamburg beat freiburg on wednesday night .
a victory over sc freiburg however could see the hamburgers climb the lower reaches of the league and maybe get some breathing space around the 12th or 13th spot , depending on how others get on . sc freiburg 's win over stuttgart may turn out to be nothing more than a blip on vfb 's roads to a possible championship rather than the win that turns their own season around .
it may have lifted them from 16th to 13th but defeat against hamburg on wednesday could see freiburg drop further . wins for both their opponents and rostock would see freiburg drop to 15th , overlooking the precipice into the abyss of the relegation zone once again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.10.2004 germany and eu divided over 2005 deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister eichel has a huge gap to fill in the budget the european commission says germany will be violating deficit limits in 2005 for the fourth year .
but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- at the same time , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac - whose country also has a three-year history of breaching the 3 percent ceiling - tackled the eu executive and the euro criteria from another angle on tuesday . at a joint news conference with chirac in berlin , schröder said he and his colleague believed changes to the stability pact must go beyond european commission proposals .
despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits . " that is a clear softening of the stability pact - that wo n't happen with me , " grasser said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gloom deepens over german economy the german economy is recovering , but the modest upturn will lose momentum as early as next year as a result of surging oil prices and a slowdown in exports , leading economic research institutes said tuesday .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 27.10.2004 bild backs bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild believes bush will be better for germany europe 's top-selling newspaper , the german tabloid bild , endorsed george w. bush for us president tuesday , saying he would do a better job fighting terror and would n't ask berlin to send troops to iraq . germany 's bild zeitung deemed bush a known quantity in europe , and said he had a better sense than democratic challenger john kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the editorial , echoing sentiments expressed by others as well . " thus he will not request a contribution , " the former publisher of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung continued .
" but kerry would do just that - and add a further burden to the already damaged german-american relationship , " he added in what a spokesman said was likely the first us election endorsement in bild 's 51-year history . germany 's center-left government fiercely opposed the war in iraq and has refused to send soldiers to lighten the load on the us-led coalition . " bush has learned his lesson " the conservative daily said the incumbent president now knew from his experiences in iraq that he needed the support of a broad base of partners and would foster those alliances more than in his first term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and george w. bush in sept .
2003 " bush has learned that america can conquer any country militarily but can not win the peace by going it alone , " he said .
" that is why he will focus more on international cooperation in his second term . " the tabloid said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . " bush has learned the lessons of history , " the editorial read .
" good words do not help against violent fanatics , only military strength .
with him , as opposed to kerry , there is no waffling . with bush , we know what to expect .
no one knows what john kerry stands for and where he wants to lead america - and the world . " most germans believe in kerry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential nominee john kerry with his wife , terea and , vice presidential candidate john edwards the endorsement for bush by the german daily follows an editorial tuesday in europe 's biggest financial newspaper the financial times backing kerry . meanwhile a poll for stern weekly magazine to be published thursday showed that a clear majority of germans believe kerry will win the nov .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .

despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.10.2004 germany and eu divided over 2005 deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister eichel has a huge gap to fill in the budget the european commission says germany will be violating deficit limits in 2005 for the fourth year .
but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- at the same time , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac - whose country also has a three-year history of breaching the 3 percent ceiling - tackled the eu executive and the euro criteria from another angle on tuesday . at a joint news conference with chirac in berlin , schröder said he and his colleague believed changes to the stability pact must go beyond european commission proposals .
despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits . " that is a clear softening of the stability pact - that wo n't happen with me , " grasser said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gloom deepens over german economy the german economy is recovering , but the modest upturn will lose momentum as early as next year as a result of surging oil prices and a slowdown in exports , leading economic research institutes said tuesday .

after rejecting the idea of tapping deutsche telekom and deutsche post for billions of euros to help bring the german public deficit back within eu limits , berlin is now considering dipping into the financial reserves of the mandatory state nursing care insurance fund , die welt said on wednesday , without revealing its sources .
from its cash pile of € 3.3 billion -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- , the nursing care insurance fund would make available an interest-free loan to the state-run health insurers who would use the cash to cut their debt and lower their premiums , the paper said .
the health insurers ' debt is included in the public budget , while the financial surplus of the nursing care insurance fund is not .
finance minister hans eichel is seeking ways of ensuring that the german public deficit next year falls back below 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- as required by the european stability and growth pact .

the judges said tui could not be blamed for failing to warn people that travelling to the tunisian resort djerba was dangerous at that time of the attack in april 2002 .
the boy , named only as adrian , was among dozens of german tourists visiting the ghriba synagogue in djerba when a truck bomb exploded outside killing 21 people , 14 of them germans , in an attack linked to osama bin laden 's al qaeda network .
adrian was left with 40 percent burns and has needed more than 30 operations .
tui had warned that if it were forced to pay compensation in this case , it would set a legal precedent that would make travel groups liable for any unpredictable event and could signal the end of package tourism .
adrian 's parents , who had travelled with tui 's offshoot 1-2-fly , were seeking damages of € 100,000 -lrb- $ 120,000 -rrb- from the group plus a monthly payment of € 800 -lrb- $ 960 -rrb- .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .
" i think that the next two years will be decisive to show whether we can succeed or not .

other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .
he added that the rejection was not politically motivated but rather a sign that parliamentarians wanted to see competent commissioners come to brussels . " there are six masons in the commission who have been asked to build planes , " cohn-bendit told german public television . last-minute talks in sometimes heated exchanges with meps during a round of meetings tuesday , barroso had earlier pleaded that with eu leaders preparing to sign the bloc 's historic constitution in rome friday , now was not the time for institutional civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , a conservative catholic who would nominally take charge of eu civil liberties , has infuriated many meps by arguing that homosexuality is a " sin " and that women should stay at home to make babies . the commission 's portuguese president-designate reiterated an offer to meps to reassign some of buttiglione 's more sensitive duties , such as anti-discrimination policy , to a four-member team of commissioners . but the offer fell on deaf ears among socialists and others , who argued that nothing short of buttiglione 's departure to a less high-profile job , or his outright resignation , would suffice . calls for barroso 's resignation " it seems to me that the commission will be defeated -lrb- wednesday -rrb- unless something happens in the meantime , " liberal leader graham watson said .
" i find it incredible that mr. buttiglione has not taken the consequences of this and offered his resignation and his withdrawal . " meanwhile italian newspaper reports said that buttiglione had refused a request from prime minister silvio berlusconi to withdraw his candidacy , to head off the crisis . " berlusconi to buttiglione : give up , " the daily la stampa headlined , saying that buttiglione had apparently dug in his heels , preferring to await the parliamentary vote . the corriere della sera reported that berlusconi telephoned buttiglione , and while he did not specifically call on the former italian minister to withdraw his candidacy he said he should make a " noble gesture " to alleviate the crisis . but saying that it was too late to reach a last-minute compromise , socialist leader martin schulz had rejected any postponement out of hand .
schulz added that barroso had failed to make any concessions to parliamentarians in the last few weeks and therefore had to take " partial blame " for the situation . hans-gert pöttering , the leader of the conservative group in parliament , had cautioned his colleagues to reconsider rejecting the commission .
he added that such a move would make it even harder to convince europeans to support the new eu constitution , due to be signed by eu leaders in rome on friday . the us is watching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi outgoing commission chief romano prodi has said he will stay on beyond nov .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .

these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .

other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .
he added that the rejection was not politically motivated but rather a sign that parliamentarians wanted to see competent commissioners come to brussels . " there are six masons in the commission who have been asked to build planes , " cohn-bendit told german public television . last-minute talks in sometimes heated exchanges with meps during a round of meetings tuesday , barroso had earlier pleaded that with eu leaders preparing to sign the bloc 's historic constitution in rome friday , now was not the time for institutional civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , a conservative catholic who would nominally take charge of eu civil liberties , has infuriated many meps by arguing that homosexuality is a " sin " and that women should stay at home to make babies . the commission 's portuguese president-designate reiterated an offer to meps to reassign some of buttiglione 's more sensitive duties , such as anti-discrimination policy , to a four-member team of commissioners . but the offer fell on deaf ears among socialists and others , who argued that nothing short of buttiglione 's departure to a less high-profile job , or his outright resignation , would suffice . calls for barroso 's resignation " it seems to me that the commission will be defeated -lrb- wednesday -rrb- unless something happens in the meantime , " liberal leader graham watson said .
" i find it incredible that mr. buttiglione has not taken the consequences of this and offered his resignation and his withdrawal . " meanwhile italian newspaper reports said that buttiglione had refused a request from prime minister silvio berlusconi to withdraw his candidacy , to head off the crisis . " berlusconi to buttiglione : give up , " the daily la stampa headlined , saying that buttiglione had apparently dug in his heels , preferring to await the parliamentary vote . the corriere della sera reported that berlusconi telephoned buttiglione , and while he did not specifically call on the former italian minister to withdraw his candidacy he said he should make a " noble gesture " to alleviate the crisis . but saying that it was too late to reach a last-minute compromise , socialist leader martin schulz had rejected any postponement out of hand .
schulz added that barroso had failed to make any concessions to parliamentarians in the last few weeks and therefore had to take " partial blame " for the situation . hans-gert pöttering , the leader of the conservative group in parliament , had cautioned his colleagues to reconsider rejecting the commission .
he added that such a move would make it even harder to convince europeans to support the new eu constitution , due to be signed by eu leaders in rome on friday . the us is watching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi outgoing commission chief romano prodi has said he will stay on beyond nov .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .

despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- at the same time , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac - whose country also has a three-year history of breaching the 3 percent ceiling - tackled the eu executive and the euro criteria from another angle on tuesday . at a joint news conference with chirac in berlin , schröder said he and his colleague believed changes to the stability pact must go beyond european commission proposals .
despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits . " that is a clear softening of the stability pact - that wo n't happen with me , " grasser said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gloom deepens over german economy the german economy is recovering , but the modest upturn will lose momentum as early as next year as a result of surging oil prices and a slowdown in exports , leading economic research institutes said tuesday .

" claudio is very important for us and we have missed him , " admitted bayern coach felix magath .
" he can hold the ball up and we play a lot better with him in the team . " bayern playmaker michael ballack was forced to watch from the stands along with his fellow german international sebastian deisler , who is recovering from his relapse into depression .
their absence handed a chance to teenager bastian schweinsteiger , 19 , and he grabbed it with both hands . young blood drives bayern on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's bastian schweinsteiger was in outsatnding form against wolfsburg .
in the ninth minute schweinsteiger - who was one of the few germans to impress at euro 2004 - produced a powerful drive from 25 yards and it took a fine save from simon jentzsch to push the effort onto the crossbar .
it was a warning that wolfsburg failed to heed , and a rampaging run from the effervescent schweinsteiger created the opening goal on 24 minutes . he ghosted past two defenders before a clever reverse pass played in pizarro to slot home .
" schweinsteiger produced a brilliant pass and i just had to slot it in , " said match hero pizarro . it was the peruvian international 's first goal of the season , and his second - when he nudged home an owen hargreaves cross on the chime of half-time - helped ease the pain of his recent injuries .
the south american star could even have netted a hat-trick but a chance on the hour mark rebounded off the post to safety . " we wanted to play on the counter attack but bayern were just too good , " acknowledged wolfsburg boss erik gerets . bvb win placates rabid fans elsewhere borussia dortmund gave their irate fans something to cheer about with a 1-0 win at hertha berlin .
hundreds of borussia fans prevented the team bus from leaving the home stadium on saturday after a 2-0 defeat to sv hamburg , but on tuesday smiles were back on some faces after borussia climbed from 15th to a more respectable 11th . " it is only the first step but a very important one , " explained dortmund manager bert van marwijk .
" i have a feeling that things are now going to improve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's jan koller won an important game for bvb .
hertha meanwhile were left feeling dejected after hitting the woodwork three times in the first 30 minutes against dortmund .
borussia rode their luck and czech striker jan koller netted the winner on 44 minutes to move the club away from the relegation zone . kaiserslautern rooted to the bottom the noose is tightening , however , around the neck of kaiserslautern coach kurt jara following a 3-1 defeat by hanover .
kaiserslautern are bottom of the table after conceding 20 goals in 10 matches but the victory lifted hanover into the dizzy heights of fourth . the loss added more pressure of lautern boss kurt jara .
kaiserslautern chairman rene jaggi said after the match jara would remain in place at least until sunday , a statement considered to be a kiss of death in soccer circles . hanover have now won five matches on the trot but perfectionist coach ewald lienen felt his side had fortune in an finely balanced match .
" i was pleased with us going forward .
what i did n't like was that we had problems in defense , " he said . bochum reverse losing streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans have something to cheer about at last .
vfl bochum , following four consecutive defeats , beat borussia mönchengladbach 3-0 , helped in part by the dismissal of ' gladbach 's jeff strasser just before the hour mark .
it was a relief for bochum coach peter neururer who recognized his players had been nervous at the start before growing in confidence after the break but he can not fully relax as yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.10.2004 fluidity of close campaign adds pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen take on vfb stuttgart in the game of the day the bundesliga continues with the second round of mid-week games completing week ten .
with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .
a defeat would not be so drastic in terms of placings with the two opponents swapping places .
either would see arminia in a not too disgraceful a position . unlike hamburg sv who currently find themselves playing the role of pale imitations of the european champions they once were .
despite raising their game to beat a shoddy borussia dortmund side 2-0 at the weekend , hamburg are still in a bad way in the third relegation spot with nine points from as many games . hamburg prepare drop-zone exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez could celebrate again if hamburg beat freiburg on wednesday night .
a victory over sc freiburg however could see the hamburgers climb the lower reaches of the league and maybe get some breathing space around the 12th or 13th spot , depending on how others get on . sc freiburg 's win over stuttgart may turn out to be nothing more than a blip on vfb 's roads to a possible championship rather than the win that turns their own season around .
it may have lifted them from 16th to 13th but defeat against hamburg on wednesday could see freiburg drop further . wins for both their opponents and rostock would see freiburg drop to 15th , overlooking the precipice into the abyss of the relegation zone once again .
but , such is the closeness of the league ; a win would take them into mid-table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern sink wolves to close title gap the first of the bundesliga 's " english week " mid-week games threw up some interesting results on tuesday night and made things at the top very tight indeed .

" claudio is very important for us and we have missed him , " admitted bayern coach felix magath .
" he can hold the ball up and we play a lot better with him in the team . " bayern playmaker michael ballack was forced to watch from the stands along with his fellow german international sebastian deisler , who is recovering from his relapse into depression .
their absence handed a chance to teenager bastian schweinsteiger , 19 , and he grabbed it with both hands . young blood drives bayern on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's bastian schweinsteiger was in outsatnding form against wolfsburg .
in the ninth minute schweinsteiger - who was one of the few germans to impress at euro 2004 - produced a powerful drive from 25 yards and it took a fine save from simon jentzsch to push the effort onto the crossbar .
it was a warning that wolfsburg failed to heed , and a rampaging run from the effervescent schweinsteiger created the opening goal on 24 minutes . he ghosted past two defenders before a clever reverse pass played in pizarro to slot home .
" schweinsteiger produced a brilliant pass and i just had to slot it in , " said match hero pizarro . it was the peruvian international 's first goal of the season , and his second - when he nudged home an owen hargreaves cross on the chime of half-time - helped ease the pain of his recent injuries .
the south american star could even have netted a hat-trick but a chance on the hour mark rebounded off the post to safety . " we wanted to play on the counter attack but bayern were just too good , " acknowledged wolfsburg boss erik gerets . bvb win placates rabid fans elsewhere borussia dortmund gave their irate fans something to cheer about with a 1-0 win at hertha berlin .
hundreds of borussia fans prevented the team bus from leaving the home stadium on saturday after a 2-0 defeat to sv hamburg , but on tuesday smiles were back on some faces after borussia climbed from 15th to a more respectable 11th . " it is only the first step but a very important one , " explained dortmund manager bert van marwijk .
" i have a feeling that things are now going to improve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's jan koller won an important game for bvb .
hertha meanwhile were left feeling dejected after hitting the woodwork three times in the first 30 minutes against dortmund .
borussia rode their luck and czech striker jan koller netted the winner on 44 minutes to move the club away from the relegation zone . kaiserslautern rooted to the bottom the noose is tightening , however , around the neck of kaiserslautern coach kurt jara following a 3-1 defeat by hanover .
kaiserslautern are bottom of the table after conceding 20 goals in 10 matches but the victory lifted hanover into the dizzy heights of fourth . the loss added more pressure of lautern boss kurt jara .
kaiserslautern chairman rene jaggi said after the match jara would remain in place at least until sunday , a statement considered to be a kiss of death in soccer circles . hanover have now won five matches on the trot but perfectionist coach ewald lienen felt his side had fortune in an finely balanced match .
" i was pleased with us going forward .
what i did n't like was that we had problems in defense , " he said . bochum reverse losing streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans have something to cheer about at last .
vfl bochum , following four consecutive defeats , beat borussia mönchengladbach 3-0 , helped in part by the dismissal of ' gladbach 's jeff strasser just before the hour mark .
it was a relief for bochum coach peter neururer who recognized his players had been nervous at the start before growing in confidence after the break but he can not fully relax as yet .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .

these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .

so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "

it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.10.2004 barroso withdraws commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso now needs to start all over incoming eu commission chief jose barroso on wednesday withdrew his current executive team and announced he will reshuffle it to avoid a veto threatening to plunge the eu into crisis . news reports on wednesday morning said that barroso was asking parliamentarians to postpone the vote in order to try and come to a solution .
other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .
he added that the rejection was not politically motivated but rather a sign that parliamentarians wanted to see competent commissioners come to brussels . " there are six masons in the commission who have been asked to build planes , " cohn-bendit told german public television . last-minute talks in sometimes heated exchanges with meps during a round of meetings tuesday , barroso had earlier pleaded that with eu leaders preparing to sign the bloc 's historic constitution in rome friday , now was not the time for institutional civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , a conservative catholic who would nominally take charge of eu civil liberties , has infuriated many meps by arguing that homosexuality is a " sin " and that women should stay at home to make babies . the commission 's portuguese president-designate reiterated an offer to meps to reassign some of buttiglione 's more sensitive duties , such as anti-discrimination policy , to a four-member team of commissioners . but the offer fell on deaf ears among socialists and others , who argued that nothing short of buttiglione 's departure to a less high-profile job , or his outright resignation , would suffice . calls for barroso 's resignation " it seems to me that the commission will be defeated -lrb- wednesday -rrb- unless something happens in the meantime , " liberal leader graham watson said .
" i find it incredible that mr. buttiglione has not taken the consequences of this and offered his resignation and his withdrawal . " meanwhile italian newspaper reports said that buttiglione had refused a request from prime minister silvio berlusconi to withdraw his candidacy , to head off the crisis . " berlusconi to buttiglione : give up , " the daily la stampa headlined , saying that buttiglione had apparently dug in his heels , preferring to await the parliamentary vote . the corriere della sera reported that berlusconi telephoned buttiglione , and while he did not specifically call on the former italian minister to withdraw his candidacy he said he should make a " noble gesture " to alleviate the crisis . but saying that it was too late to reach a last-minute compromise , socialist leader martin schulz had rejected any postponement out of hand .
schulz added that barroso had failed to make any concessions to parliamentarians in the last few weeks and therefore had to take " partial blame " for the situation . hans-gert pöttering , the leader of the conservative group in parliament , had cautioned his colleagues to reconsider rejecting the commission .
he added that such a move would make it even harder to convince europeans to support the new eu constitution , due to be signed by eu leaders in rome on friday . the us is watching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi outgoing commission chief romano prodi has said he will stay on beyond nov .

other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .
he added that the rejection was not politically motivated but rather a sign that parliamentarians wanted to see competent commissioners come to brussels . " there are six masons in the commission who have been asked to build planes , " cohn-bendit told german public television . last-minute talks in sometimes heated exchanges with meps during a round of meetings tuesday , barroso had earlier pleaded that with eu leaders preparing to sign the bloc 's historic constitution in rome friday , now was not the time for institutional civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , a conservative catholic who would nominally take charge of eu civil liberties , has infuriated many meps by arguing that homosexuality is a " sin " and that women should stay at home to make babies . the commission 's portuguese president-designate reiterated an offer to meps to reassign some of buttiglione 's more sensitive duties , such as anti-discrimination policy , to a four-member team of commissioners . but the offer fell on deaf ears among socialists and others , who argued that nothing short of buttiglione 's departure to a less high-profile job , or his outright resignation , would suffice . calls for barroso 's resignation " it seems to me that the commission will be defeated -lrb- wednesday -rrb- unless something happens in the meantime , " liberal leader graham watson said .
" i find it incredible that mr. buttiglione has not taken the consequences of this and offered his resignation and his withdrawal . " meanwhile italian newspaper reports said that buttiglione had refused a request from prime minister silvio berlusconi to withdraw his candidacy , to head off the crisis . " berlusconi to buttiglione : give up , " the daily la stampa headlined , saying that buttiglione had apparently dug in his heels , preferring to await the parliamentary vote . the corriere della sera reported that berlusconi telephoned buttiglione , and while he did not specifically call on the former italian minister to withdraw his candidacy he said he should make a " noble gesture " to alleviate the crisis . but saying that it was too late to reach a last-minute compromise , socialist leader martin schulz had rejected any postponement out of hand .
schulz added that barroso had failed to make any concessions to parliamentarians in the last few weeks and therefore had to take " partial blame " for the situation . hans-gert pöttering , the leader of the conservative group in parliament , had cautioned his colleagues to reconsider rejecting the commission .
he added that such a move would make it even harder to convince europeans to support the new eu constitution , due to be signed by eu leaders in rome on friday . the us is watching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi outgoing commission chief romano prodi has said he will stay on beyond nov .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 27.10.2004 bild backs bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild believes bush will be better for germany europe 's top-selling newspaper , the german tabloid bild , endorsed george w. bush for us president tuesday , saying he would do a better job fighting terror and would n't ask berlin to send troops to iraq . germany 's bild zeitung deemed bush a known quantity in europe , and said he had a better sense than democratic challenger john kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the editorial , echoing sentiments expressed by others as well . " thus he will not request a contribution , " the former publisher of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung continued .
" but kerry would do just that - and add a further burden to the already damaged german-american relationship , " he added in what a spokesman said was likely the first us election endorsement in bild 's 51-year history . germany 's center-left government fiercely opposed the war in iraq and has refused to send soldiers to lighten the load on the us-led coalition . " bush has learned his lesson " the conservative daily said the incumbent president now knew from his experiences in iraq that he needed the support of a broad base of partners and would foster those alliances more than in his first term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and george w. bush in sept .
2003 " bush has learned that america can conquer any country militarily but can not win the peace by going it alone , " he said .
" that is why he will focus more on international cooperation in his second term . " the tabloid said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . " bush has learned the lessons of history , " the editorial read .
" good words do not help against violent fanatics , only military strength .
with him , as opposed to kerry , there is no waffling . with bush , we know what to expect .
no one knows what john kerry stands for and where he wants to lead america - and the world . " most germans believe in kerry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential nominee john kerry with his wife , terea and , vice presidential candidate john edwards the endorsement for bush by the german daily follows an editorial tuesday in europe 's biggest financial newspaper the financial times backing kerry . meanwhile a poll for stern weekly magazine to be published thursday showed that a clear majority of germans believe kerry will win the nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.10.2004 fluidity of close campaign adds pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen take on vfb stuttgart in the game of the day the bundesliga continues with the second round of mid-week games completing week ten .
with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .
a defeat would not be so drastic in terms of placings with the two opponents swapping places .
either would see arminia in a not too disgraceful a position . unlike hamburg sv who currently find themselves playing the role of pale imitations of the european champions they once were .
despite raising their game to beat a shoddy borussia dortmund side 2-0 at the weekend , hamburg are still in a bad way in the third relegation spot with nine points from as many games . hamburg prepare drop-zone exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez could celebrate again if hamburg beat freiburg on wednesday night .
a victory over sc freiburg however could see the hamburgers climb the lower reaches of the league and maybe get some breathing space around the 12th or 13th spot , depending on how others get on . sc freiburg 's win over stuttgart may turn out to be nothing more than a blip on vfb 's roads to a possible championship rather than the win that turns their own season around .
it may have lifted them from 16th to 13th but defeat against hamburg on wednesday could see freiburg drop further . wins for both their opponents and rostock would see freiburg drop to 15th , overlooking the precipice into the abyss of the relegation zone once again .
but , such is the closeness of the league ; a win would take them into mid-table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern sink wolves to close title gap the first of the bundesliga 's " english week " mid-week games threw up some interesting results on tuesday night and made things at the top very tight indeed .

" nine points from ten bundesliga matches and getting knocked out of the cup is not good enough , " explained gladbach president rolf konigs . coaching duties in the meantime will fall to mönchengladbach 's amateur team coach horst küppel , who will lead the seniors out for an acid test of his man motivation skills at home against bayern munich this weekend . fach is the third managerial casualty of the current season following hamburg 's sacking of klaus toppmöller ten days ago and jupp heynckes ' forced departure from schalke 04 in mid-september .
ironically former gladbach star heynckes is now being touted for the vacant job . depression rife claims berlin defender hertha berlin defender josip simunic claims almost half of the players in the bundesliga struggle to cope with the pressure that leads to the depressive state his former team-mate sebastian deisler is in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler 's case is not an isolated one , claims simunic .
bayern munich midfielder deisler , 24 , was readmitted to the max-planck-institute for psychiatry on tuesday and croatian international simunic believes the pressure affects a lot more players . " many professional footballers can not cope with the pressure , " simunic told daily bild .
" i would say every second player in the bundesliga has problems but are too afraid to admit them .
football is about having a clear head and deisler does not have that at the moment . " simunic , 24 , played with deisler for two seasons at hertha and himself suffered from depression when he was at sv hamburg in 1999 .
" i wanted to pack football in , " confessed simunic .
" i was depressed and physically at my lowest level .
at one stage i went a whole week without sleeping . " cologne slap prince-ly sum on podolski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince could attract a king 's ransom in transfer fees .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .

despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .
" i think that the next two years will be decisive to show whether we can succeed or not .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.10.2004 barroso withdraws commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso now needs to start all over incoming eu commission chief jose barroso on wednesday withdrew his current executive team and announced he will reshuffle it to avoid a veto threatening to plunge the eu into crisis . news reports on wednesday morning said that barroso was asking parliamentarians to postpone the vote in order to try and come to a solution .
other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .
he added that the rejection was not politically motivated but rather a sign that parliamentarians wanted to see competent commissioners come to brussels . " there are six masons in the commission who have been asked to build planes , " cohn-bendit told german public television . last-minute talks in sometimes heated exchanges with meps during a round of meetings tuesday , barroso had earlier pleaded that with eu leaders preparing to sign the bloc 's historic constitution in rome friday , now was not the time for institutional civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , a conservative catholic who would nominally take charge of eu civil liberties , has infuriated many meps by arguing that homosexuality is a " sin " and that women should stay at home to make babies . the commission 's portuguese president-designate reiterated an offer to meps to reassign some of buttiglione 's more sensitive duties , such as anti-discrimination policy , to a four-member team of commissioners . but the offer fell on deaf ears among socialists and others , who argued that nothing short of buttiglione 's departure to a less high-profile job , or his outright resignation , would suffice . calls for barroso 's resignation " it seems to me that the commission will be defeated -lrb- wednesday -rrb- unless something happens in the meantime , " liberal leader graham watson said .
" i find it incredible that mr. buttiglione has not taken the consequences of this and offered his resignation and his withdrawal . " meanwhile italian newspaper reports said that buttiglione had refused a request from prime minister silvio berlusconi to withdraw his candidacy , to head off the crisis . " berlusconi to buttiglione : give up , " the daily la stampa headlined , saying that buttiglione had apparently dug in his heels , preferring to await the parliamentary vote . the corriere della sera reported that berlusconi telephoned buttiglione , and while he did not specifically call on the former italian minister to withdraw his candidacy he said he should make a " noble gesture " to alleviate the crisis . but saying that it was too late to reach a last-minute compromise , socialist leader martin schulz had rejected any postponement out of hand .
schulz added that barroso had failed to make any concessions to parliamentarians in the last few weeks and therefore had to take " partial blame " for the situation . hans-gert pöttering , the leader of the conservative group in parliament , had cautioned his colleagues to reconsider rejecting the commission .
he added that such a move would make it even harder to convince europeans to support the new eu constitution , due to be signed by eu leaders in rome on friday . the us is watching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi outgoing commission chief romano prodi has said he will stay on beyond nov .

" we 'd like to ask our male passengers in particular to sit down , buckle up and refrain from smoking . " after conquering the german market , spuk has already taken over toilets in scandinavia , the netherlands and canada . next on the list is a tougher challenge : according to officials for the company that makes the device , spuk will soon try to convert italian men as well . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners protest pee proposal german men have long been ridiculed by males in other countries for succumbing to the matriarchal decree of sitting down while urinating .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 27.10.2004 bild backs bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild believes bush will be better for germany europe 's top-selling newspaper , the german tabloid bild , endorsed george w. bush for us president tuesday , saying he would do a better job fighting terror and would n't ask berlin to send troops to iraq . germany 's bild zeitung deemed bush a known quantity in europe , and said he had a better sense than democratic challenger john kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the editorial , echoing sentiments expressed by others as well . " thus he will not request a contribution , " the former publisher of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung continued .
" but kerry would do just that - and add a further burden to the already damaged german-american relationship , " he added in what a spokesman said was likely the first us election endorsement in bild 's 51-year history . germany 's center-left government fiercely opposed the war in iraq and has refused to send soldiers to lighten the load on the us-led coalition . " bush has learned his lesson " the conservative daily said the incumbent president now knew from his experiences in iraq that he needed the support of a broad base of partners and would foster those alliances more than in his first term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and george w. bush in sept .
2003 " bush has learned that america can conquer any country militarily but can not win the peace by going it alone , " he said .
" that is why he will focus more on international cooperation in his second term . " the tabloid said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . " bush has learned the lessons of history , " the editorial read .
" good words do not help against violent fanatics , only military strength .
with him , as opposed to kerry , there is no waffling . with bush , we know what to expect .
no one knows what john kerry stands for and where he wants to lead america - and the world . " most germans believe in kerry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential nominee john kerry with his wife , terea and , vice presidential candidate john edwards the endorsement for bush by the german daily follows an editorial tuesday in europe 's biggest financial newspaper the financial times backing kerry . meanwhile a poll for stern weekly magazine to be published thursday showed that a clear majority of germans believe kerry will win the nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.10.2004 fluidity of close campaign adds pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen take on vfb stuttgart in the game of the day the bundesliga continues with the second round of mid-week games completing week ten .
with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .
a defeat would not be so drastic in terms of placings with the two opponents swapping places .
either would see arminia in a not too disgraceful a position . unlike hamburg sv who currently find themselves playing the role of pale imitations of the european champions they once were .
despite raising their game to beat a shoddy borussia dortmund side 2-0 at the weekend , hamburg are still in a bad way in the third relegation spot with nine points from as many games . hamburg prepare drop-zone exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez could celebrate again if hamburg beat freiburg on wednesday night .
a victory over sc freiburg however could see the hamburgers climb the lower reaches of the league and maybe get some breathing space around the 12th or 13th spot , depending on how others get on . sc freiburg 's win over stuttgart may turn out to be nothing more than a blip on vfb 's roads to a possible championship rather than the win that turns their own season around .
it may have lifted them from 16th to 13th but defeat against hamburg on wednesday could see freiburg drop further . wins for both their opponents and rostock would see freiburg drop to 15th , overlooking the precipice into the abyss of the relegation zone once again .
but , such is the closeness of the league ; a win would take them into mid-table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern sink wolves to close title gap the first of the bundesliga 's " english week " mid-week games threw up some interesting results on tuesday night and made things at the top very tight indeed .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- at the same time , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac - whose country also has a three-year history of breaching the 3 percent ceiling - tackled the eu executive and the euro criteria from another angle on tuesday . at a joint news conference with chirac in berlin , schröder said he and his colleague believed changes to the stability pact must go beyond european commission proposals .
despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits . " that is a clear softening of the stability pact - that wo n't happen with me , " grasser said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gloom deepens over german economy the german economy is recovering , but the modest upturn will lose momentum as early as next year as a result of surging oil prices and a slowdown in exports , leading economic research institutes said tuesday .

with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .
a defeat would not be so drastic in terms of placings with the two opponents swapping places .
either would see arminia in a not too disgraceful a position . unlike hamburg sv who currently find themselves playing the role of pale imitations of the european champions they once were .
despite raising their game to beat a shoddy borussia dortmund side 2-0 at the weekend , hamburg are still in a bad way in the third relegation spot with nine points from as many games . hamburg prepare drop-zone exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez could celebrate again if hamburg beat freiburg on wednesday night .
a victory over sc freiburg however could see the hamburgers climb the lower reaches of the league and maybe get some breathing space around the 12th or 13th spot , depending on how others get on . sc freiburg 's win over stuttgart may turn out to be nothing more than a blip on vfb 's roads to a possible championship rather than the win that turns their own season around .
it may have lifted them from 16th to 13th but defeat against hamburg on wednesday could see freiburg drop further . wins for both their opponents and rostock would see freiburg drop to 15th , overlooking the precipice into the abyss of the relegation zone once again .
but , such is the closeness of the league ; a win would take them into mid-table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern sink wolves to close title gap the first of the bundesliga 's " english week " mid-week games threw up some interesting results on tuesday night and made things at the top very tight indeed .

" nine points from ten bundesliga matches and getting knocked out of the cup is not good enough , " explained gladbach president rolf konigs . coaching duties in the meantime will fall to mönchengladbach 's amateur team coach horst küppel , who will lead the seniors out for an acid test of his man motivation skills at home against bayern munich this weekend . fach is the third managerial casualty of the current season following hamburg 's sacking of klaus toppmöller ten days ago and jupp heynckes ' forced departure from schalke 04 in mid-september .

" this jewel is not for sale even at 20 million euros , " said cologne president wolfgang overath . podolski , capped five times by germany , is contracted at cologne until 2007 and the club insist there are no get-out clauses .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 .
-lrb- ap photo / fritz reiss -rrb- at the same time , german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac - whose country also has a three-year history of breaching the 3 percent ceiling - tackled the eu executive and the euro criteria from another angle on tuesday . at a joint news conference with chirac in berlin , schröder said he and his colleague believed changes to the stability pact must go beyond european commission proposals .
despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits . " that is a clear softening of the stability pact - that wo n't happen with me , " grasser said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gloom deepens over german economy the german economy is recovering , but the modest upturn will lose momentum as early as next year as a result of surging oil prices and a slowdown in exports , leading economic research institutes said tuesday .

thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast .

" we 'd like to ask our male passengers in particular to sit down , buckle up and refrain from smoking . " after conquering the german market , spuk has already taken over toilets in scandinavia , the netherlands and canada . next on the list is a tougher challenge : according to officials for the company that makes the device , spuk will soon try to convert italian men as well . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners protest pee proposal german men have long been ridiculed by males in other countries for succumbing to the matriarchal decree of sitting down while urinating .

" nine points from ten bundesliga matches and getting knocked out of the cup is not good enough , " explained gladbach president rolf konigs . coaching duties in the meantime will fall to mönchengladbach 's amateur team coach horst küppel , who will lead the seniors out for an acid test of his man motivation skills at home against bayern munich this weekend . fach is the third managerial casualty of the current season following hamburg 's sacking of klaus toppmöller ten days ago and jupp heynckes ' forced departure from schalke 04 in mid-september .

bayern munich midfielder deisler , 24 , was readmitted to the max-planck-institute for psychiatry on tuesday and croatian international simunic believes the pressure affects a lot more players . " many professional footballers can not cope with the pressure , " simunic told daily bild .
" i would say every second player in the bundesliga has problems but are too afraid to admit them .
football is about having a clear head and deisler does not have that at the moment . " simunic , 24 , played with deisler for two seasons at hertha and himself suffered from depression when he was at sv hamburg in 1999 .
" i wanted to pack football in , " confessed simunic .
" i was depressed and physically at my lowest level .
at one stage i went a whole week without sleeping . " cologne slap prince-ly sum on podolski bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prince could attract a king 's ransom in transfer fees .
germany 's 19-year-old international striker lukas podolski has had a staggering € 20 million -lrb- $ 25.5 million -rrb- price-tag placed on his head by his german club cologne . podolski recently claimed he would leave cologne if they did not win promotion to the bundesliga this season but the club are not willing to let ' prince podolski ' leave the rheinenergie stadium , not even for a king 's ransom .
" this jewel is not for sale even at 20 million euros , " said cologne president wolfgang overath . podolski , capped five times by germany , is contracted at cologne until 2007 and the club insist there are no get-out clauses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.10.2004 keeping production in germany , but for less pay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany leads in exports , but the labor market is suffering as a result with germany ’ s high labor costs , many companies are relocating their production to cheaper places .
but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .
" i think that the next two years will be decisive to show whether we can succeed or not .

but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.10.2004 fluidity of close campaign adds pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen take on vfb stuttgart in the game of the day the bundesliga continues with the second round of mid-week games completing week ten .
with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .
a defeat would not be so drastic in terms of placings with the two opponents swapping places .
either would see arminia in a not too disgraceful a position . unlike hamburg sv who currently find themselves playing the role of pale imitations of the european champions they once were .
despite raising their game to beat a shoddy borussia dortmund side 2-0 at the weekend , hamburg are still in a bad way in the third relegation spot with nine points from as many games . hamburg prepare drop-zone exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez could celebrate again if hamburg beat freiburg on wednesday night .
a victory over sc freiburg however could see the hamburgers climb the lower reaches of the league and maybe get some breathing space around the 12th or 13th spot , depending on how others get on . sc freiburg 's win over stuttgart may turn out to be nothing more than a blip on vfb 's roads to a possible championship rather than the win that turns their own season around .
it may have lifted them from 16th to 13th but defeat against hamburg on wednesday could see freiburg drop further . wins for both their opponents and rostock would see freiburg drop to 15th , overlooking the precipice into the abyss of the relegation zone once again .
but , such is the closeness of the league ; a win would take them into mid-table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern sink wolves to close title gap the first of the bundesliga 's " english week " mid-week games threw up some interesting results on tuesday night and made things at the top very tight indeed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.10.2004 fluidity of close campaign adds pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen take on vfb stuttgart in the game of the day the bundesliga continues with the second round of mid-week games completing week ten .
with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .

deutsche bank 's former chairman and current supervisory board head rolf breuer said that the german banking sector was " completely overstaffed . "
asked whether that meant jobs would have to cut , he replied : " that too . "
deutsche bank 's supervisory board was already " talking intensively " about restructuring , breuer said , but gave no indication when the outcome of those talks might be made public .
" we 're talking here about jobs .
things do n't move very quickly on this issue in germany . "
breuer refused to rule out a possible relocation of deutsche bank 's administrative headquarters - or holding - away from germany in the long run .
" germany is n't a natural site for holding companies , " he said , blaming high taxation and the principle of co-determination on supervisory boards . however , deutsche bank 's retail banking operations would remain in germany , breuer said .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 27.10.2004 bild backs bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild believes bush will be better for germany europe 's top-selling newspaper , the german tabloid bild , endorsed george w. bush for us president tuesday , saying he would do a better job fighting terror and would n't ask berlin to send troops to iraq . germany 's bild zeitung deemed bush a known quantity in europe , and said he had a better sense than democratic challenger john kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the editorial , echoing sentiments expressed by others as well . " thus he will not request a contribution , " the former publisher of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung continued .
" but kerry would do just that - and add a further burden to the already damaged german-american relationship , " he added in what a spokesman said was likely the first us election endorsement in bild 's 51-year history . germany 's center-left government fiercely opposed the war in iraq and has refused to send soldiers to lighten the load on the us-led coalition . " bush has learned his lesson " the conservative daily said the incumbent president now knew from his experiences in iraq that he needed the support of a broad base of partners and would foster those alliances more than in his first term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and george w. bush in sept .

" that is why he will focus more on international cooperation in his second term . " the tabloid said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .

despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 27.10.2004 bild backs bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild believes bush will be better for germany europe 's top-selling newspaper , the german tabloid bild , endorsed george w. bush for us president tuesday , saying he would do a better job fighting terror and would n't ask berlin to send troops to iraq . germany 's bild zeitung deemed bush a known quantity in europe , and said he had a better sense than democratic challenger john kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the editorial , echoing sentiments expressed by others as well . " thus he will not request a contribution , " the former publisher of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung continued .
" but kerry would do just that - and add a further burden to the already damaged german-american relationship , " he added in what a spokesman said was likely the first us election endorsement in bild 's 51-year history . germany 's center-left government fiercely opposed the war in iraq and has refused to send soldiers to lighten the load on the us-led coalition . " bush has learned his lesson " the conservative daily said the incumbent president now knew from his experiences in iraq that he needed the support of a broad base of partners and would foster those alliances more than in his first term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and george w. bush in sept .

" that is why he will focus more on international cooperation in his second term . " the tabloid said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . " bush has learned the lessons of history , " the editorial read .
" good words do not help against violent fanatics , only military strength .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.10.2004 barroso withdraws commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso now needs to start all over incoming eu commission chief jose barroso on wednesday withdrew his current executive team and announced he will reshuffle it to avoid a veto threatening to plunge the eu into crisis . news reports on wednesday morning said that barroso was asking parliamentarians to postpone the vote in order to try and come to a solution .
other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .
he added that the rejection was not politically motivated but rather a sign that parliamentarians wanted to see competent commissioners come to brussels . " there are six masons in the commission who have been asked to build planes , " cohn-bendit told german public television . last-minute talks in sometimes heated exchanges with meps during a round of meetings tuesday , barroso had earlier pleaded that with eu leaders preparing to sign the bloc 's historic constitution in rome friday , now was not the time for institutional civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , a conservative catholic who would nominally take charge of eu civil liberties , has infuriated many meps by arguing that homosexuality is a " sin " and that women should stay at home to make babies . the commission 's portuguese president-designate reiterated an offer to meps to reassign some of buttiglione 's more sensitive duties , such as anti-discrimination policy , to a four-member team of commissioners . but the offer fell on deaf ears among socialists and others , who argued that nothing short of buttiglione 's departure to a less high-profile job , or his outright resignation , would suffice . calls for barroso 's resignation " it seems to me that the commission will be defeated -lrb- wednesday -rrb- unless something happens in the meantime , " liberal leader graham watson said .
" i find it incredible that mr. buttiglione has not taken the consequences of this and offered his resignation and his withdrawal . " meanwhile italian newspaper reports said that buttiglione had refused a request from prime minister silvio berlusconi to withdraw his candidacy , to head off the crisis . " berlusconi to buttiglione : give up , " the daily la stampa headlined , saying that buttiglione had apparently dug in his heels , preferring to await the parliamentary vote . the corriere della sera reported that berlusconi telephoned buttiglione , and while he did not specifically call on the former italian minister to withdraw his candidacy he said he should make a " noble gesture " to alleviate the crisis . but saying that it was too late to reach a last-minute compromise , socialist leader martin schulz had rejected any postponement out of hand .
schulz added that barroso had failed to make any concessions to parliamentarians in the last few weeks and therefore had to take " partial blame " for the situation . hans-gert pöttering , the leader of the conservative group in parliament , had cautioned his colleagues to reconsider rejecting the commission .

other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .

" claudio is very important for us and we have missed him , " admitted bayern coach felix magath .
" he can hold the ball up and we play a lot better with him in the team . " bayern playmaker michael ballack was forced to watch from the stands along with his fellow german international sebastian deisler , who is recovering from his relapse into depression .
their absence handed a chance to teenager bastian schweinsteiger , 19 , and he grabbed it with both hands . young blood drives bayern on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's bastian schweinsteiger was in outsatnding form against wolfsburg .
in the ninth minute schweinsteiger - who was one of the few germans to impress at euro 2004 - produced a powerful drive from 25 yards and it took a fine save from simon jentzsch to push the effort onto the crossbar .
it was a warning that wolfsburg failed to heed , and a rampaging run from the effervescent schweinsteiger created the opening goal on 24 minutes . he ghosted past two defenders before a clever reverse pass played in pizarro to slot home .
" schweinsteiger produced a brilliant pass and i just had to slot it in , " said match hero pizarro . it was the peruvian international 's first goal of the season , and his second - when he nudged home an owen hargreaves cross on the chime of half-time - helped ease the pain of his recent injuries .
the south american star could even have netted a hat-trick but a chance on the hour mark rebounded off the post to safety . " we wanted to play on the counter attack but bayern were just too good , " acknowledged wolfsburg boss erik gerets . bvb win placates rabid fans elsewhere borussia dortmund gave their irate fans something to cheer about with a 1-0 win at hertha berlin .
hundreds of borussia fans prevented the team bus from leaving the home stadium on saturday after a 2-0 defeat to sv hamburg , but on tuesday smiles were back on some faces after borussia climbed from 15th to a more respectable 11th . " it is only the first step but a very important one , " explained dortmund manager bert van marwijk .
" i have a feeling that things are now going to improve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's jan koller won an important game for bvb .
hertha meanwhile were left feeling dejected after hitting the woodwork three times in the first 30 minutes against dortmund .
borussia rode their luck and czech striker jan koller netted the winner on 44 minutes to move the club away from the relegation zone . kaiserslautern rooted to the bottom the noose is tightening , however , around the neck of kaiserslautern coach kurt jara following a 3-1 defeat by hanover .
kaiserslautern are bottom of the table after conceding 20 goals in 10 matches but the victory lifted hanover into the dizzy heights of fourth . the loss added more pressure of lautern boss kurt jara .
kaiserslautern chairman rene jaggi said after the match jara would remain in place at least until sunday , a statement considered to be a kiss of death in soccer circles . hanover have now won five matches on the trot but perfectionist coach ewald lienen felt his side had fortune in an finely balanced match .
" i was pleased with us going forward .
what i did n't like was that we had problems in defense , " he said . bochum reverse losing streak bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans have something to cheer about at last .
vfl bochum , following four consecutive defeats , beat borussia mönchengladbach 3-0 , helped in part by the dismissal of ' gladbach 's jeff strasser just before the hour mark .
it was a relief for bochum coach peter neururer who recognized his players had been nervous at the start before growing in confidence after the break but he can not fully relax as yet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.10.2004 barroso withdraws commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso now needs to start all over incoming eu commission chief jose barroso on wednesday withdrew his current executive team and announced he will reshuffle it to avoid a veto threatening to plunge the eu into crisis . news reports on wednesday morning said that barroso was asking parliamentarians to postpone the vote in order to try and come to a solution .
other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .
he added that the rejection was not politically motivated but rather a sign that parliamentarians wanted to see competent commissioners come to brussels . " there are six masons in the commission who have been asked to build planes , " cohn-bendit told german public television . last-minute talks in sometimes heated exchanges with meps during a round of meetings tuesday , barroso had earlier pleaded that with eu leaders preparing to sign the bloc 's historic constitution in rome friday , now was not the time for institutional civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , a conservative catholic who would nominally take charge of eu civil liberties , has infuriated many meps by arguing that homosexuality is a " sin " and that women should stay at home to make babies . the commission 's portuguese president-designate reiterated an offer to meps to reassign some of buttiglione 's more sensitive duties , such as anti-discrimination policy , to a four-member team of commissioners . but the offer fell on deaf ears among socialists and others , who argued that nothing short of buttiglione 's departure to a less high-profile job , or his outright resignation , would suffice . calls for barroso 's resignation " it seems to me that the commission will be defeated -lrb- wednesday -rrb- unless something happens in the meantime , " liberal leader graham watson said .
" i find it incredible that mr. buttiglione has not taken the consequences of this and offered his resignation and his withdrawal . " meanwhile italian newspaper reports said that buttiglione had refused a request from prime minister silvio berlusconi to withdraw his candidacy , to head off the crisis . " berlusconi to buttiglione : give up , " the daily la stampa headlined , saying that buttiglione had apparently dug in his heels , preferring to await the parliamentary vote . the corriere della sera reported that berlusconi telephoned buttiglione , and while he did not specifically call on the former italian minister to withdraw his candidacy he said he should make a " noble gesture " to alleviate the crisis . but saying that it was too late to reach a last-minute compromise , socialist leader martin schulz had rejected any postponement out of hand .
schulz added that barroso had failed to make any concessions to parliamentarians in the last few weeks and therefore had to take " partial blame " for the situation . hans-gert pöttering , the leader of the conservative group in parliament , had cautioned his colleagues to reconsider rejecting the commission .
he added that such a move would make it even harder to convince europeans to support the new eu constitution , due to be signed by eu leaders in rome on friday . the us is watching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi outgoing commission chief romano prodi has said he will stay on beyond nov .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .

three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .

in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .

last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.10.2004 keeping production in germany , but for less pay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany leads in exports , but the labor market is suffering as a result with germany ’ s high labor costs , many companies are relocating their production to cheaper places .
but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .
" i think that the next two years will be decisive to show whether we can succeed or not .

outsourcing made in germany using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created .

" bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the editorial , echoing sentiments expressed by others as well . " thus he will not request a contribution , " the former publisher of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung continued .
" but kerry would do just that - and add a further burden to the already damaged german-american relationship , " he added in what a spokesman said was likely the first us election endorsement in bild 's 51-year history . germany 's center-left government fiercely opposed the war in iraq and has refused to send soldiers to lighten the load on the us-led coalition . " bush has learned his lesson " the conservative daily said the incumbent president now knew from his experiences in iraq that he needed the support of a broad base of partners and would foster those alliances more than in his first term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and george w. bush in sept .
2003 " bush has learned that america can conquer any country militarily but can not win the peace by going it alone , " he said .
" that is why he will focus more on international cooperation in his second term . " the tabloid said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . " bush has learned the lessons of history , " the editorial read .
" good words do not help against violent fanatics , only military strength .
with him , as opposed to kerry , there is no waffling . with bush , we know what to expect .
no one knows what john kerry stands for and where he wants to lead america - and the world . " most germans believe in kerry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential nominee john kerry with his wife , terea and , vice presidential candidate john edwards the endorsement for bush by the german daily follows an editorial tuesday in europe 's biggest financial newspaper the financial times backing kerry . meanwhile a poll for stern weekly magazine to be published thursday showed that a clear majority of germans believe kerry will win the nov .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .

in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .
" i think that the next two years will be decisive to show whether we can succeed or not .

outsourcing made in germany using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created .

other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .
he added that the rejection was not politically motivated but rather a sign that parliamentarians wanted to see competent commissioners come to brussels . " there are six masons in the commission who have been asked to build planes , " cohn-bendit told german public television . last-minute talks in sometimes heated exchanges with meps during a round of meetings tuesday , barroso had earlier pleaded that with eu leaders preparing to sign the bloc 's historic constitution in rome friday , now was not the time for institutional civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , a conservative catholic who would nominally take charge of eu civil liberties , has infuriated many meps by arguing that homosexuality is a " sin " and that women should stay at home to make babies . the commission 's portuguese president-designate reiterated an offer to meps to reassign some of buttiglione 's more sensitive duties , such as anti-discrimination policy , to a four-member team of commissioners . but the offer fell on deaf ears among socialists and others , who argued that nothing short of buttiglione 's departure to a less high-profile job , or his outright resignation , would suffice . calls for barroso 's resignation " it seems to me that the commission will be defeated -lrb- wednesday -rrb- unless something happens in the meantime , " liberal leader graham watson said .
" i find it incredible that mr. buttiglione has not taken the consequences of this and offered his resignation and his withdrawal . " meanwhile italian newspaper reports said that buttiglione had refused a request from prime minister silvio berlusconi to withdraw his candidacy , to head off the crisis . " berlusconi to buttiglione : give up , " the daily la stampa headlined , saying that buttiglione had apparently dug in his heels , preferring to await the parliamentary vote . the corriere della sera reported that berlusconi telephoned buttiglione , and while he did not specifically call on the former italian minister to withdraw his candidacy he said he should make a " noble gesture " to alleviate the crisis . but saying that it was too late to reach a last-minute compromise , socialist leader martin schulz had rejected any postponement out of hand .
schulz added that barroso had failed to make any concessions to parliamentarians in the last few weeks and therefore had to take " partial blame " for the situation . hans-gert pöttering , the leader of the conservative group in parliament , had cautioned his colleagues to reconsider rejecting the commission .

other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .

foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 27.10.2004 bild backs bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bild believes bush will be better for germany europe 's top-selling newspaper , the german tabloid bild , endorsed george w. bush for us president tuesday , saying he would do a better job fighting terror and would n't ask berlin to send troops to iraq . germany 's bild zeitung deemed bush a known quantity in europe , and said he had a better sense than democratic challenger john kerry of what washington could expect from its transatlantic partners . " bush knows that europe and germany do not have the military capacity for a significantly larger commitment of troops beyond their current deployments abroad , " bild journalist hugo müller-vogg said in the editorial , echoing sentiments expressed by others as well . " thus he will not request a contribution , " the former publisher of the respected frankfurter allgemeine zeitung continued .
" but kerry would do just that - and add a further burden to the already damaged german-american relationship , " he added in what a spokesman said was likely the first us election endorsement in bild 's 51-year history . germany 's center-left government fiercely opposed the war in iraq and has refused to send soldiers to lighten the load on the us-led coalition . " bush has learned his lesson " the conservative daily said the incumbent president now knew from his experiences in iraq that he needed the support of a broad base of partners and would foster those alliances more than in his first term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder and george w. bush in sept .

" that is why he will focus more on international cooperation in his second term . " the tabloid said that kerry would wage a weaker war on terror than bush and had done little to explain how he would lead the united states on the world stage . " bush has learned the lessons of history , " the editorial read .
" good words do not help against violent fanatics , only military strength .
with him , as opposed to kerry , there is no waffling . with bush , we know what to expect .
no one knows what john kerry stands for and where he wants to lead america - and the world . " most germans believe in kerry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : democratic presidential nominee john kerry with his wife , terea and , vice presidential candidate john edwards the endorsement for bush by the german daily follows an editorial tuesday in europe 's biggest financial newspaper the financial times backing kerry . meanwhile a poll for stern weekly magazine to be published thursday showed that a clear majority of germans believe kerry will win the nov .

" nine points from ten bundesliga matches and getting knocked out of the cup is not good enough , " explained gladbach president rolf konigs . coaching duties in the meantime will fall to mönchengladbach 's amateur team coach horst küppel , who will lead the seniors out for an acid test of his man motivation skills at home against bayern munich this weekend . fach is the third managerial casualty of the current season following hamburg 's sacking of klaus toppmöller ten days ago and jupp heynckes ' forced departure from schalke 04 in mid-september .

bayern munich midfielder deisler , 24 , was readmitted to the max-planck-institute for psychiatry on tuesday and croatian international simunic believes the pressure affects a lot more players . " many professional footballers can not cope with the pressure , " simunic told daily bild .
" i would say every second player in the bundesliga has problems but are too afraid to admit them .
football is about having a clear head and deisler does not have that at the moment . " simunic , 24 , played with deisler for two seasons at hertha and himself suffered from depression when he was at sv hamburg in 1999 .
" i wanted to pack football in , " confessed simunic .
" i was depressed and physically at my lowest level .

" this jewel is not for sale even at 20 million euros , " said cologne president wolfgang overath . podolski , capped five times by germany , is contracted at cologne until 2007 and the club insist there are no get-out clauses .
he scored seven goals in the final eight bundesliga matches last season and has netted eight times in nine league outings this term to head the german second division scoring charts . fahrenhorst faces extended lay-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank fahrenhorst will be missing from the champions ' defense for longer than expected .

with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .

bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .
a defeat would not be so drastic in terms of placings with the two opponents swapping places .
either would see arminia in a not too disgraceful a position . unlike hamburg sv who currently find themselves playing the role of pale imitations of the european champions they once were .
despite raising their game to beat a shoddy borussia dortmund side 2-0 at the weekend , hamburg are still in a bad way in the third relegation spot with nine points from as many games . hamburg prepare drop-zone exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez could celebrate again if hamburg beat freiburg on wednesday night .
a victory over sc freiburg however could see the hamburgers climb the lower reaches of the league and maybe get some breathing space around the 12th or 13th spot , depending on how others get on . sc freiburg 's win over stuttgart may turn out to be nothing more than a blip on vfb 's roads to a possible championship rather than the win that turns their own season around .
it may have lifted them from 16th to 13th but defeat against hamburg on wednesday could see freiburg drop further . wins for both their opponents and rostock would see freiburg drop to 15th , overlooking the precipice into the abyss of the relegation zone once again .
but , such is the closeness of the league ; a win would take them into mid-table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern sink wolves to close title gap the first of the bundesliga 's " english week " mid-week games threw up some interesting results on tuesday night and made things at the top very tight indeed .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .

despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .
" i think that the next two years will be decisive to show whether we can succeed or not .

outsourcing made in germany using the threat of moving jobs abroad as a bargaining chip to get labor concessions is becoming popular amongst german companies .
but there 's more to outsourcing than the heated political debate it 's created .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .

despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits .

" claudio is very important for us and we have missed him , " admitted bayern coach felix magath .
" he can hold the ball up and we play a lot better with him in the team . " bayern playmaker michael ballack was forced to watch from the stands along with his fellow german international sebastian deisler , who is recovering from his relapse into depression .
their absence handed a chance to teenager bastian schweinsteiger , 19 , and he grabbed it with both hands . young blood drives bayern on bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's bastian schweinsteiger was in outsatnding form against wolfsburg .
in the ninth minute schweinsteiger - who was one of the few germans to impress at euro 2004 - produced a powerful drive from 25 yards and it took a fine save from simon jentzsch to push the effort onto the crossbar .
it was a warning that wolfsburg failed to heed , and a rampaging run from the effervescent schweinsteiger created the opening goal on 24 minutes . he ghosted past two defenders before a clever reverse pass played in pizarro to slot home .
" schweinsteiger produced a brilliant pass and i just had to slot it in , " said match hero pizarro . it was the peruvian international 's first goal of the season , and his second - when he nudged home an owen hargreaves cross on the chime of half-time - helped ease the pain of his recent injuries .

" it is only the first step but a very important one , " explained dortmund manager bert van marwijk .
" i have a feeling that things are now going to improve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's jan koller won an important game for bvb .
hertha meanwhile were left feeling dejected after hitting the woodwork three times in the first 30 minutes against dortmund .

kaiserslautern are bottom of the table after conceding 20 goals in 10 matches but the victory lifted hanover into the dizzy heights of fourth . the loss added more pressure of lautern boss kurt jara .
kaiserslautern chairman rene jaggi said after the match jara would remain in place at least until sunday , a statement considered to be a kiss of death in soccer circles . hanover have now won five matches on the trot but perfectionist coach ewald lienen felt his side had fortune in an finely balanced match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.10.2004 keeping production in germany , but for less pay großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany leads in exports , but the labor market is suffering as a result with germany ’ s high labor costs , many companies are relocating their production to cheaper places .
but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a worker at tool factory zerbst assembles machinery but the high demand for german goods and services worldwide has also led to higher unemployment in germany .
many people have lost their jobs because companies choose to relocate their manufacturing abroad , where it ’ s cheaper .
three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .
1 , 2004 .
in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .
" i think that the next two years will be decisive to show whether we can succeed or not .

but one swabian firm has found a solution to keep manufacturing close to home . it was a painful decision for metabo ’ s 2,600 employees .
but less money for the same work was still better than no money for no work .
metabo ’ s management needed to cut costs , as many german companies do .
last fall , the power tool manufacturer made the options to its workers clear : either gradual cutbacks in production in germany or strengthening the nürtingen facility through lower wages and massive investments .
" we were also told that if we didn ’ t agree , then relocation to china would begin , " said peter teubel , head of the works council .
the threat at gunpoint was effective and the workers agreed to renounce part of their wages .
it was a difficult decision , but at least it ensured their jobs for the time being , teubel said .
several measures , including a move from incentive to time wages , as well as the end of special work breaks , meant 20 percent less labor costs for metabo .
in return , the management said it would not cut jobs in germany until at least 2008 .
it also documented its commitment to nürtingen with a € 14 million -lrb- $ 17.8 million -rrb- investment volume .
the competition has long moved east germany , the euro zone 's largest economy , has just been named the world 's leading export champion in 2004 - for the second year running .

three swabian tinkerers founded metabo in 1924 , producing hand-powered drills .
today , the product range includes 200 power tools of numerous types .
the company manufactures some 10,000 electric drills , angle grinders or saws - daily .
they produce almost solely in germany , while the competition has long since migrated to the far east for manufacturing .
the " mercedes " of the power tool sector " our lodestar is quality , " said metabo 's outgoing ceo martin bertinchamp , who is leaving the company on nov .

in order to maintain its reputation as the " mercedes " in this sector , metabo regularly trains 80 apprentices and offers all employees additional instruction .
they also invest significantly in development and the corresponding quality control , he said .
and it ’ s profitable , said bertinchamp , without disclosing exact revenues .
last year , sales were down slightly from € 395 million to € 380 million .
exports to over 100 countries make up for 80 percent of this amount .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's construction sector is in a deep crisis but the ceo is worried about the central european market .
the downturn in the construction sector has led to less demand for professional power tools , he said .
in addition , many do-it-yourselfers have turned from handymen into computer lovers .
these developments leave the rapidly growing asian markets as potential customers .
but they are also home to many competitors .
so , in order to continue to be in the black , metabo simply had to lower its labor costs , said bertinchamp .
" it ’ s going to get worse " bertinchamp said regardless of these measures , many changes are needed to ensure germany ’ s position as an industrial stronghold .
politicians needed to radically clean up social and tax systems , as well as environmental and industrial safety regulations , he said .
" we need more flexibility in working hours and the protection laws against dismissal need to be relaxed , " said bertinchamp .
" we need to have the opportunity to keep certain activities here , but to pay less wages for this , as is the case in other countries , too . "
the ceo doubts , though , that these changes will be implemented in time .
his skepticism is directed mainly towards politicians .
" it ’ s going to get worse before everyone in germany realizes that we need real reforms and that these must be implemented quickly , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.10.2004 barroso withdraws commission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso now needs to start all over incoming eu commission chief jose barroso on wednesday withdrew his current executive team and announced he will reshuffle it to avoid a veto threatening to plunge the eu into crisis . news reports on wednesday morning said that barroso was asking parliamentarians to postpone the vote in order to try and come to a solution .
other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks .

other reports said that barroso was going to withdraw the proposed list of commissioners when he addresses parliamentarians before noon . in what would amount to an unprecedented institutional crisis , a majority of european parliament members -lrb- meps -rrb- seem set to veto barroso 's new team because of his refusal to replace rocco buttiglione , a former italian minister , as justice commissioner . nearly all the 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals are to vote against the barroso team in wednesday 's noon vote , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups , meps said . barroso , facing a knife-edge vote in the european parliament which looked increasingly likely to go against him , made the announcement in parliament after consulting with key party leaders . while parliamentarians applauded the decision , they immediately began a heated discussion to come to terms with what is an unprecedented situation for the european union . barroso told party leaders that he planned to go on a tour of european capitals to come up with a modified commission , which he would present to parliamentarians within a few weeks . " that 's what he said to the presidents of the groups , " marielle de sarnez told afp , referring to the heads of the three main political groupings in the eu assembly . the fast-moving developments came after a series of meetings late tuesday failed to overcome the deadlock . the veto threat was in response to barroso 's insistence on keeping rocco buttiglione as his pick for the sensitive eu justice brief , despite a storm sparked by the italian 's comments on gays and women . as of late tuesday , nearly all 200 socialists in the 732-seat legislature and at least 50 liberals were said to be preparing to vote against the barroso team , along with smaller left-wing and euroskeptic groups . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daniel cohn-bendit " there 's no majority in parliament supporting barroso today , " said daniel cohn-bendit -lrb- photo -rrb- , the leader of the greens group .
he added that the rejection was not politically motivated but rather a sign that parliamentarians wanted to see competent commissioners come to brussels . " there are six masons in the commission who have been asked to build planes , " cohn-bendit told german public television . last-minute talks in sometimes heated exchanges with meps during a round of meetings tuesday , barroso had earlier pleaded that with eu leaders preparing to sign the bloc 's historic constitution in rome friday , now was not the time for institutional civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rocco buttiglione buttiglione -lrb- photo -rrb- , a conservative catholic who would nominally take charge of eu civil liberties , has infuriated many meps by arguing that homosexuality is a " sin " and that women should stay at home to make babies . the commission 's portuguese president-designate reiterated an offer to meps to reassign some of buttiglione 's more sensitive duties , such as anti-discrimination policy , to a four-member team of commissioners . but the offer fell on deaf ears among socialists and others , who argued that nothing short of buttiglione 's departure to a less high-profile job , or his outright resignation , would suffice . calls for barroso 's resignation " it seems to me that the commission will be defeated -lrb- wednesday -rrb- unless something happens in the meantime , " liberal leader graham watson said .
" i find it incredible that mr. buttiglione has not taken the consequences of this and offered his resignation and his withdrawal . " meanwhile italian newspaper reports said that buttiglione had refused a request from prime minister silvio berlusconi to withdraw his candidacy , to head off the crisis . " berlusconi to buttiglione : give up , " the daily la stampa headlined , saying that buttiglione had apparently dug in his heels , preferring to await the parliamentary vote . the corriere della sera reported that berlusconi telephoned buttiglione , and while he did not specifically call on the former italian minister to withdraw his candidacy he said he should make a " noble gesture " to alleviate the crisis . but saying that it was too late to reach a last-minute compromise , socialist leader martin schulz had rejected any postponement out of hand .
schulz added that barroso had failed to make any concessions to parliamentarians in the last few weeks and therefore had to take " partial blame " for the situation . hans-gert pöttering , the leader of the conservative group in parliament , had cautioned his colleagues to reconsider rejecting the commission .
he added that such a move would make it even harder to convince europeans to support the new eu constitution , due to be signed by eu leaders in rome on friday . the us is watching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romano prodi outgoing commission chief romano prodi has said he will stay on beyond nov .

but german finance minister eichel disputes the forecast . germany is heading for budget deficits of 3.4 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in 2005 and 2.9 percent in 2006 , according to a european commission 's forecast published tuesday .
thus europe 's biggest economy would once more breach the eu stability and growth pact that underpins the euro and requires countries using the currency to keep their deficits below 3 percent of gdp . but germany 's finance minister hans eichel rejected the forecast . " we want to abide by the pact and present a budget in conformity with the constitution , " said eichel 's spokesman , jörg müller , on tuesday , according to the associated press .
müller pointed out that german government expects growth of 1.7 percent next year , while the eu executive predicts 1.5 percent growth , a difference that amounts to hundreds of millions of euros in tax revenues . besides the restrictions laid down by the stability pact , germany 's constitution requires governments to balance their budgets . the european commission 's forecast resembles those of germany 's leading economic institutes , the majority of which have said the country 's budget deficit would drop from to 3.5 percent of gdp in 2005 from 3.9 percent in 2004 . searching for a way out eichel has been under pressure lately to find a way to fill up state coffers and has given no indication of what he will do . plans circulated by his ministry said he was considering making a deal with the formerly state-owned postal and telecommunications companies deutsche post and deutsche telekom to stock up the treasury .
but after examining the idea , which involved the government assuming long-term pension commitments for billions of euros in quick cash , eichel rejected it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : notorious stability pact offenders : gerhard schröder and jacques chirac german chancellor gerhard schroeder , right , talks with the french president jacques chirac , left , after chirac 'a arrival for the fourth german french minister council in the berlin chancellery tuesday , oct .

despite deficits , euro-zone countries should be given " more space " for investments in education and research . last year , the pact suffered a major blow when france and germany managed to avoid disciplinary action for breaching the deficit limit much to the ire of smaller countries , some of which have bent over backwards to follow the rules . austria 's finance minister karl-heinz grasser said in the thursday issue of business weekly wirtschaftswoche that the european commission must again start action against germany for violating the pact or risk losing even more credibility . he also spoke out against the commission 's proposals to loosen the pact giving countries suffering from weak economic phases more time to bring down their deficits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.10.2004 fluidity of close campaign adds pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen take on vfb stuttgart in the game of the day the bundesliga continues with the second round of mid-week games completing week ten .
with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .
a defeat would not be so drastic in terms of placings with the two opponents swapping places .
either would see arminia in a not too disgraceful a position . unlike hamburg sv who currently find themselves playing the role of pale imitations of the european champions they once were .
despite raising their game to beat a shoddy borussia dortmund side 2-0 at the weekend , hamburg are still in a bad way in the third relegation spot with nine points from as many games . hamburg prepare drop-zone exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez could celebrate again if hamburg beat freiburg on wednesday night .
a victory over sc freiburg however could see the hamburgers climb the lower reaches of the league and maybe get some breathing space around the 12th or 13th spot , depending on how others get on . sc freiburg 's win over stuttgart may turn out to be nothing more than a blip on vfb 's roads to a possible championship rather than the win that turns their own season around .
it may have lifted them from 16th to 13th but defeat against hamburg on wednesday could see freiburg drop further . wins for both their opponents and rostock would see freiburg drop to 15th , overlooking the precipice into the abyss of the relegation zone once again .
but , such is the closeness of the league ; a win would take them into mid-table . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern sink wolves to close title gap the first of the bundesliga 's " english week " mid-week games threw up some interesting results on tuesday night and made things at the top very tight indeed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.10.2004 fluidity of close campaign adds pressure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen take on vfb stuttgart in the game of the day the bundesliga continues with the second round of mid-week games completing week ten .
with four matches already decided , wednesday night 's results could be the rise or fall for many . vfb stuttgart will have watched the bayern munich - wolfsburg game with interest .
wolfsburg took advantage of vfb 's defeat against freiburg at the weekend by retaking top slot on sunday with a 3-0 win over bochum . however , bayern curtailed the wolves on tuesday night with two claudio pizarro goals sealing a 2-0 win .
that result leaves stuttgart one point behind wolfsburg with a game in hand . that game is against champions werder bremen .
a win for stuttgart in the big game of the top tier will take vfb to the top of the league once more .
however , werder will be looking to close a gap of their own . lying in fifth and six points off the top before wednesday 's game , bremen will be cautious not to lose any more ground to the breakaway pack at the top of the league . champions need to close the gap bayern moved into the third slot with their win over wolfsburg , just a point off the summit , while hanover 's fifth straight win keeps them in fourth .
bremen will have to leap-frog a number of form teams if they want to get to the top by christmas , the position they were in at the winter break last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fsv mainz 05 just behind them , on the same number of points , sit fsv mainz .
the promoted team were flying high with confidence and with good results found themselves in third before the 2-1 defeat to schalke 04 at the weekend saw them drop to sixth .
a win in week ten could see mainz stay in touch with the leaders , possibly moving up to fourth if bremen lose in stuttgart . mainz play host to hansa rostock on wednesday .
it 's already looking like an uphill battle for the team from far north .
second from bottom with just eight points from nine games , rostock travel to mainz after losing 2-0 to bayern munich on saturday .
a win , however , will take them out of the drop zone and , other results permitting , as high as 12th . schalke look to climb at nuremberg 's expense the team currently inhabiting that slot is nuremberg .
a home match against schalke 04 is the challenge that awaits juri schlünz 's team if they want to fend off the advances of those below rostock who want to supplant them . a resurgent schalke 04 is probably not the best test of a wobbling side 's confidence straight after a 4-1 drubbing by the champions werder bremen at the weekend .
however , that heavy defeat was not compounded by results around them and nuremberg only slipped one place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton is recapturing his form for schalke at last .
schalke 04 recorded their third win off the bat at the weekend by beating mainz .
victories over bochum and bayern in consecutive weeks have taken the royal blues out of the doldrums of the relegation zone and fired their title challenge . now up to sixth seventh on the same number of points as mainz and bremen , schalke are in striking distance of the top four .
with brazilian striker ailton scoring - and apparently happy - at last , the royal blues will be confident of climbing the league after wednesday night 's match . leverkusen in danger of mediocrity another team who will also be looking to step up a couple of rungs is bayer leverkusen .
the exciting form of the early exchanges has been replaced by frustrating inconsistency .
one minute leverkusen are tearing apart quality opposition , the next they 're stumbling as if their boot laces are tied together . the weekend 's disappointing 0-0 draw with now bottom club kaiserslautern was a gilt-edged opportunity to return to the top five .
instead , bayer face arminia bielefeld as the ninth placed team in the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bielefeld were sixth a month ago but reality seems to have bitten a little and the promoted side have since dropped back to eighth .
they can find out whether it was just a case of altitude sickness or a calling to permanent mid-table mediocrity on wednesday night . higher echelons call to bielefeld can they maintain a bid for a european place or is it just an anomaly in what should , on paper , be a season of struggle for the newcomers ?
a win over leverkusen will see bielefeld climb as high as fifth , if bremen lose , and will have the team watching each other for nose bleeds .
a defeat would not be so drastic in terms of placings with the two opponents swapping places .
either would see arminia in a not too disgraceful a position . unlike hamburg sv who currently find themselves playing the role of pale imitations of the european champions they once were .
despite raising their game to beat a shoddy borussia dortmund side 2-0 at the weekend , hamburg are still in a bad way in the third relegation spot with nine points from as many games . hamburg prepare drop-zone exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sergej barbarez could celebrate again if hamburg beat freiburg on wednesday night .
a victory over sc freiburg however could see the hamburgers climb the lower reaches of the league and maybe get some breathing space around the 12th or 13th spot , depending on how others get on . sc freiburg 's win over stuttgart may turn out to be nothing more than a blip on vfb 's roads to a possible championship rather than the win that turns their own season around .

" nine points from ten bundesliga matches and getting knocked out of the cup is not good enough , " explained gladbach president rolf konigs . coaching duties in the meantime will fall to mönchengladbach 's amateur team coach horst küppel , who will lead the seniors out for an acid test of his man motivation skills at home against bayern munich this weekend . fach is the third managerial casualty of the current season following hamburg 's sacking of klaus toppmöller ten days ago and jupp heynckes ' forced departure from schalke 04 in mid-september .
ironically former gladbach star heynckes is now being touted for the vacant job . depression rife claims berlin defender hertha berlin defender josip simunic claims almost half of the players in the bundesliga struggle to cope with the pressure that leads to the depressive state his former team-mate sebastian deisler is in . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler 's case is not an isolated one , claims simunic .
bayern munich midfielder deisler , 24 , was readmitted to the max-planck-institute for psychiatry on tuesday and croatian international simunic believes the pressure affects a lot more players . " many professional footballers can not cope with the pressure , " simunic told daily bild .
" i would say every second player in the bundesliga has problems but are too afraid to admit them .
football is about having a clear head and deisler does not have that at the moment . " simunic , 24 , played with deisler for two seasons at hertha and himself suffered from depression when he was at sv hamburg in 1999 .

germany 's 19-year-old international striker lukas podolski has had a staggering € 20 million -lrb- $ 25.5 million -rrb- price-tag placed on his head by his german club cologne . podolski recently claimed he would leave cologne if they did not win promotion to the bundesliga this season but the club are not willing to let ' prince podolski ' leave the rheinenergie stadium , not even for a king 's ransom .
" this jewel is not for sale even at 20 million euros , " said cologne president wolfgang overath . podolski , capped five times by germany , is contracted at cologne until 2007 and the club insist there are no get-out clauses .
he scored seven goals in the final eight bundesliga matches last season and has netted eight times in nine league outings this term to head the german second division scoring charts . fahrenhorst faces extended lay-off bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frank fahrenhorst will be missing from the champions ' defense for longer than expected .
werder bremen defender frank fahrenhorst is suffering from a severe ankle injury which will keep him out of action for an undisclosed period , the german champions reported tuesday . the 27-year-old german international 's injury was first spotted around 10 days ago in training but tests have revealed it is more serious than initial indications suggested .

fidel castro announced the ban , which takes effect in two weeks , in response to a tightened us embargo .
the us said the move demonstrated cuba 's " economic desperation " ; later the cuban central bank said the move had struck a " forceful blow " at the us .
meanwhile , queues have begun forming as ordinary cubans try to change money .
the new measure , announced on monday , will see dollars banned in commercial transactions in cuba .
instead , " convertible pesos " , pegged one-to-one against the dollar and available only in cuba , will be used .
the dollar will not become illegal tender , but cubans and tourists will have to pay a 10 % charge to convert dollars when the measure takes effect on 8 november .
our correspondent in havana , stephen gibbs , says this measure will enable it to receive and control far more of the hundreds of millions of dollars that tourists and cubans living abroad bring or send here every year .
' typical castro ' assistant us treasury secretary juan carlos zarate called the cuban move " an act of economic desperation " .
" in typical castro fashion , his solution to this problem is to implement a measure that will directly benefit and bring profit to his regime , while hurting the cuban people , " mr zarate said , according to afp news agency .
adam ereli , us state department spokesman , said " it was a confiscatory measure that demonstrates that president -lsb- george w -rsb- bush 's policy is working " .
in may , the us announced it was tightening its embargo on cuba , with measures including capping the remittances sent to the island by cubans in the us .
their words drew a sharp response from francisco soberon , president of the central bank of cuba -lrb- bcc -rrb- .
" we feel very happy , very sure of what we have done , we have hit them where it hurts , we have withdrawn its currency in our national territory , " news agency efe quoted him as saying on cuban tv .
" we have delivered a forceful blow -lsb- to the us -rsb- and we have at this time absolute monetary sovereignty , " he said .
cubans complain meanwhile , some cuban people complained they were getting caught in the crossfire of an ideological battle .
" fidel wants to get back the greenbacks and squeeze the people , " said a cafeteria worker , alfredo , who spoke to the news agency reuters .
but some analysts said it made sense for cuba to reduce its dependence on the dollar , which was legalised in cuba in 1993 following its economic crash in the 1990s .
many cubans have become dependant on dollars for many goods , including some basic necessities .
the convertible peso -lrb- popularly known as the " chavito " -rrb- was originally introduced to plug the gap between supply and demand for dollars on the island .
the government is encouraging tourists to bring and remittances to be sent in other currencies such as euros .
cubans began to queue on tuesday to change dollars into pesos , and longer queues are expected on wednesday when the convertible peso becomes available .
other cubans said they would open dollar accounts to hold their money .

fidel castro announced the ban , which takes effect in two weeks , in response to a tightened us embargo .
the us said the move demonstrated cuba 's " economic desperation " ; later the cuban central bank said the move had struck a " forceful blow " at the us .
meanwhile , queues have begun forming as ordinary cubans try to change money .
the new measure , announced on monday , will see dollars banned in commercial transactions in cuba .
instead , " convertible pesos " , pegged one-to-one against the dollar and available only in cuba , will be used .
the dollar will not become illegal tender , but cubans and tourists will have to pay a 10 % charge to convert dollars when the measure takes effect on 8 november .
our correspondent in havana , stephen gibbs , says this measure will enable it to receive and control far more of the hundreds of millions of dollars that tourists and cubans living abroad bring or send here every year .
' typical castro ' assistant us treasury secretary juan carlos zarate called the cuban move " an act of economic desperation " .
" in typical castro fashion , his solution to this problem is to implement a measure that will directly benefit and bring profit to his regime , while hurting the cuban people , " mr zarate said , according to afp news agency .
adam ereli , us state department spokesman , said " it was a confiscatory measure that demonstrates that president -lsb- george w -rsb- bush 's policy is working " .
in may , the us announced it was tightening its embargo on cuba , with measures including capping the remittances sent to the island by cubans in the us .
their words drew a sharp response from francisco soberon , president of the central bank of cuba -lrb- bcc -rrb- .
" we feel very happy , very sure of what we have done , we have hit them where it hurts , we have withdrawn its currency in our national territory , " news agency efe quoted him as saying on cuban tv .
" we have delivered a forceful blow -lsb- to the us -rsb- and we have at this time absolute monetary sovereignty , " he said .
cubans complain meanwhile , some cuban people complained they were getting caught in the crossfire of an ideological battle .
" fidel wants to get back the greenbacks and squeeze the people , " said a cafeteria worker , alfredo , who spoke to the news agency reuters .
but some analysts said it made sense for cuba to reduce its dependence on the dollar , which was legalised in cuba in 1993 following its economic crash in the 1990s .
many cubans have become dependant on dollars for many goods , including some basic necessities .
the convertible peso -lrb- popularly known as the " chavito " -rrb- was originally introduced to plug the gap between supply and demand for dollars on the island .
the government is encouraging tourists to bring and remittances to be sent in other currencies such as euros .
cubans began to queue on tuesday to change dollars into pesos , and longer queues are expected on wednesday when the convertible peso becomes available .
other cubans said they would open dollar accounts to hold their money .

in a strongly worded report , released on wednesday , the organisation accuses the us of tolerating prisoner abuse .
images of us servicemen abusing iraqis in baghdad 's abu ghraib prison would haunt the world for years to come , the report claims .
the report is published six days before the us presidential election .
launching the report , " human dignity denied : torture and accountability in the war on terror , " amnesty international officials called on the us government to condemn the use of torture and ban it through legislation .
us military reviews of prisoner abuse scandals cleared senior civilian and military officials of complicity or involvement .
several us servicemen are currently facing courts martial for their alleged roles in the abuse at abu ghraib prison .
' accountability crucial ' the amnesty international report calls for an independent review of prison of alleged abuses of prisoners at abu ghraib as well as in afghanistan and camp x-ray , the prison camp erected on the us military base at guantanamo bay , cuba .
when alleged abuse involved us agents , its response was denial and disregard for the amnesty international 's concerns amnesty report into the us military prison regime abu ghraib : dark stain on iraq 's past and the us was urged to ensure fair access to detainees , abolish secret detentions , ratify international treaties and pay reparations to victims of abuse .
" there remains a need for a full commission of inquiry that takes a genuinely comprehensive and independent look at the usa 's ' war on terror ' detention and interrogation policies and procedures , and examines the activities of all government agencies and all levels of government , " the report said .
" full accountability is crucial " .
the us was also accused of falling short of maintaining in its own prisons the high standards of human rights that it demands of other nations .
" when it suited the us government 's aims in its build-up to the invasion of iraq , the administration cited amnesty international 's reports on torture in that country .
" when the alleged abuse involved us agents , its response was denial and disregard for the organisation 's concerns , " the report said .
political motives ?
images of hooded and chained prisoners caused an outcry the bbc 's david bamford says the report has very few moderate words for us president george w bush .
but our correspondent notes that there may be little impact on the upcoming us vote , as much of the report 's contents have been in the public domain for months .
amnesty international spokeswoman theresa richardson said the timing of the report was not an attempt to influence the us campaign , but said the organisation was disappointed the issue had not been more prominently debated .
" we feel this is the last chance to get it on the agenda of the candidates , " she said .

the national institute for clinical excellence says that the interval between appointments should be tailored to each patient 's needs .
some patients with more problems with their teeth would see their dentist more frequently , whilst others might not need to see their dentist as often .
nice recommends the interval for adults should be between three and 24 months .
for under-18s the interval should be between three and 12 months .
welcome change the guideline should get dentists and their patients talking to each other more about oral health .
peter wilkins dentists have welcomed the move as ' common sense ' .
there has been mounting concerns about a shortage of dentists .
we have always believed the frequency of dental check-ups should be based on the individual patient .
a spokeswoman for the british dental association in some regions of the uk , hundreds of people have had to queue in the streets to sign up with a new nhs dentist .
a report for the department of health in july said there was a shortage of 1,850 dentists in england alone in 2003 .
extending the interval between routine check-ups for those with good oral health would free up dentists ' time to treat those who have problems with their teeth .
peter wilkins , of the faculty of general dental practitioners , worked on the new guidelines .
he said : " this guideline should help ensure consistency in the way patients ' check-ups are handled throughout the country .
" the guideline should get dentists and their patients talking to each other more about oral health and agreeing together how often the patient should come in for a check-up .
" whilst this guideline may mean that some people see their dentist less often for check-ups , it is important to stress that patients can , and should , come back and see their dentist sooner if they experience any problems with their teeth between check-ups . "
dentists ' reaction ralph davies , of the british dental association , welcomed the new guidelines .
he said : " the bda has always held that the frequency of dental check-ups should be based on the individual patient , not a ' one size fits all ' system .
" how often you need an examination should be based on what is best for you as a patient and the clinical judgement of your dentist .
" nice has also called for more research to be carried out on this subject and the bda strongly supports this . "
professor raman bedi , the chief dental officer for england , said oral health had improved dramatically during the last 30 years .
" routine visits to the dentist every six months are no longer necessary for everyone , due to the use of fluoride toothpaste and better oral health education . "
the guidance will only cover nhs dental services in england and wales .

attacks in north belfast doubled between april and september this year , the city 's district policing partnership has been told .
over the 183-day period there were 129 so-called hate crimes recorded throughout the city .
belfast dpp member naomi long described the statistics as " disturbing " and said more could be done .

" i do think the police need to consider the issue of surveillance , for example , to try and apprehend the people that are involved because one of the disappointing things is how few people are convicted . "
the statistics were given to the belfast dpp on monday after the northern ireland affairs committee met in the city to probe hate crime legislation .
' rapidly growing ' representatives of gay and ethnic minority groups told mps that greater support was needed from the police to deal with attacks .
mps heard the police could benefit from training , while anna lo of the chinese welfare association said officers can be dismissive of attacks .
the number of racist attacks has doubled in the past year and the gay community has also been targeted .
meanwhile , a firework has been thrown into a house in portrush , county antrim , in what police believe was a racially motivated attack .

this change came into effect in june .
the committee said the government needed to include attacks on the disabled in the draft criminal justice -lrb- ni -rrb- order , to be introduced later this year .
the planned legislation would require judges to take into account any racial , religious or sexual orientation factors when sentencing .

the firm said underlying sales fell 1.3 % on the year as bad weather and weak consumer confidence hit demand for ice cream in its key european market .
pre-tax profits were down 2 % at 1.3bn euros -lrb- £ 890m ; $ 1.6bn -rrb- .
unilever , maker of lipton tea and magnum ice cream , said it was " dissatisfied " with its performance .
stop the rot " actions are being taken to improve the market competitiveness of our products , " it said in a statement .
measures aimed at reversing the slide in sales include increased expenditure in advertising , and price cuts on some products .
the company said it would be reviewing its targets for 2005 - 2010 , and reiterated its earlier forecast that profits for the full year would grow in the " low single digits . "

the derby and sandiacre canal society has been given a lottery grant of nearly £ 30,000 to carry out the clean up work at swarkestone .

although the area will not be open to boats , the group hopes it will be a place of relaxation for the public .

the man , who can not be identified , moved into a house in mid wales on the same street as the girl 's family after he was released from prison .
her relatives are calling for the rules governing the release of convicted paedophiles to be tightened .
it comes after a serial paedophile from cardiff was jailed for life on monday for abusing an 11-year-old boy .

commenting on the case of the 10-year-old girl , roger williams , liberal democrat mp for brecon and radnorshire , said it was " entirely inappropriate " that the sex attacker should have been released from prison into the area where he committed the offence .
" i 've written to powys county council asking that urgent consideration be given to him in finding alternative accommodation , " he said .
" but this sort of planning needs to be taken before the person is released from prison and not after , " he added .
