" the -lrb- social democratic-green party -rrb- coalition should finally follow the example of other eu countries and act " against the growing phenomenon , cdu representative michael kretschmer told the dpa news agency .
the government 's lack of action and disinterest is no longer acceptable given increasing gas prices , he said .
the mineral-oil industry estimates the loss of tax revenues at a billion euros , kretschmer said .
while other countries have taken on the problem directly - for example , northern italy has a special eu exception until 2006 allowing for lower taxes to combat cheap gas sold in switzerland and slovenia - berlin has only tried to get the eu to institute an increase in the lowest tax bracket , he complained . more briefs 01.11.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler may open russia plant 01.11.2004 -pipe- gm 's opel said to have a future in germany 29.10.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn is slow to pay bills , firms say 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler allegedly probed over secret bank accounts 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler stands by smart 28.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler steers back into profit 28.10.2004 -pipe- altana suffers setback in launch of asthma drugs 28.10.2004 -pipe- hypovereinsbank buys portfolio from ing bhf 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .

he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .

monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .

he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .
the run-off is expected to take place on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2004 as germany 's role changes , so does military großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr : coming to a crisis region near you the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .
though the new german military might not need them , local residents are nervous . a military spokesman confirmed sunday that germany 's bundeswehr will shut down more than 105 military bases as part of an overall plan to trim down the country 's military forces . the announcement , which will be made official by german defense minister peter struck in berlin on tuesday , ends weeks of speculation on the fate of the bases . military officials said last week that they planned closures in each one of germany 's 16 states . the shut-downs come as the bundeswehr embarks on a reform that will reduce the number of troops from 280,000 to 250,000 by 2010 . us-like reform the changes are supposed to reflect the transformation the bundeswehr has undergone from a national guard to an army serving in peace missions around the world .
there are more than 2,000 german troops currently serving in the nato peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
an additional 5,000 troops are stationed in the balkans .
struck , echoing a modern military philosophy shared in washington , has repeatedly said he wants his military smaller , more specialized and able to deploy quickly . germany 's larger role on the world stage , evident by its ambitions of winning a permanent seat on the un security council , has meant more is expected of the country than the " checkbook diplomacy " former chancellor helmut kohl exercised in the persian gulf war in 1991 . current military structures make the sort of long-term missions currently required of german troops by nato and the european union in central asia and the balkans difficult .
in addition , mobilizing troops takes too long , say critics , a major problem when rapid troop deployment in crisis regions is called for . cuts make locals nervous in addition to the 35,000 soldiers cut from the army , the bundeswehr plans to eliminate 10,000 civilian jobs . talk of cuts has been a political hot potato in recent months , especially with the announcment by washington last summer that it will withdraw a large portion of its 70,000 troop contingent stationed in germany . residents of the cities in which the bases were located had protested possible closures .
as in the case of us and british military camps in southern germany , the bundeswehr barracks and camps help support local economies . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck criticized over timing of army cuts german defense minister peter struck is pushing through the most radical reform of the german army to date despite the impending massive us troop withdrawal from germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe current affairs -pipe- 01.11.2004 foreign governments take sides in us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i have china 's support , i hear russia is backing you ? "
foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .
foreigners appear to be no different , perhaps explaining why an unprecedented number of governments have decided to take sides in the contest for the white house . brushing aside concerns of meddling in american domestic affairs , china on monday joined the swelling ranks of nations offering their opinion on the presidential race . beijing broke its practice of not commenting on us presidential candidates and chastised bush for his foreign policies .
in a rare commentary , former vice-premier and former longtime foreign minister qian qichen criticized bush 's war on iraq .
he accused an " arrogant " united states of trying to " rule the world " and blamed the us-led invasion for sparking an increase in terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qian qichen " the philosophy of the ' bush doctrine ' is in essence force , " qian said in the government-run english-language china daily .
" it advocates the united states should rule over the whole world with overwhelming force , military force in particular . " while backing bush 's anti-terrorism efforts , china opposed the war in iraq and sees the us administration 's policies as an example of superpower hegemony , which beijing frequently rails against .
" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .
russian president vladimir putin recently tacitly threw his support behind the texan by implying terrorists would prefer that bush be booted from office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard australia 's prime minister john howard has also strongly backed the bush administration 's uncompromising war on terror , however , his comments urging bush 's re-election has elicited criticism both at home and in america . australia 's opposition called on howard on monday to publicly retract comments he made hoping bush would win the us election .
howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .
but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest .

foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .
foreigners appear to be no different , perhaps explaining why an unprecedented number of governments have decided to take sides in the contest for the white house . brushing aside concerns of meddling in american domestic affairs , china on monday joined the swelling ranks of nations offering their opinion on the presidential race . beijing broke its practice of not commenting on us presidential candidates and chastised bush for his foreign policies .
in a rare commentary , former vice-premier and former longtime foreign minister qian qichen criticized bush 's war on iraq .
he accused an " arrogant " united states of trying to " rule the world " and blamed the us-led invasion for sparking an increase in terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qian qichen " the philosophy of the ' bush doctrine ' is in essence force , " qian said in the government-run english-language china daily .
" it advocates the united states should rule over the whole world with overwhelming force , military force in particular . " while backing bush 's anti-terrorism efforts , china opposed the war in iraq and sees the us administration 's policies as an example of superpower hegemony , which beijing frequently rails against .
" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .
russian president vladimir putin recently tacitly threw his support behind the texan by implying terrorists would prefer that bush be booted from office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard australia 's prime minister john howard has also strongly backed the bush administration 's uncompromising war on terror , however , his comments urging bush 's re-election has elicited criticism both at home and in america . australia 's opposition called on howard on monday to publicly retract comments he made hoping bush would win the us election .
howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .

he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .
anyone who chooses to take part will also be able to enter a lottery for a canon digital camera and other prizes . the international panel of experts meets in bonn , germany , at the end of november to decide which candidates get the jury prize , and all bobs winners will be announced on dec .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .
anyone who chooses to take part will also be able to enter a lottery for a canon digital camera and other prizes . the international panel of experts meets in bonn , germany , at the end of november to decide which candidates get the jury prize , and all bobs winners will be announced on dec .
6 . sponsored by typepad and maritim hotels deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international weblog awards are being supported by typepad , sixapart ’ s blog services .
typepad is a blog provider that gives users a rich set of features to immediately share and publish the information they want .

though the new german military might not need them , local residents are nervous . a military spokesman confirmed sunday that germany 's bundeswehr will shut down more than 105 military bases as part of an overall plan to trim down the country 's military forces . the announcement , which will be made official by german defense minister peter struck in berlin on tuesday , ends weeks of speculation on the fate of the bases . military officials said last week that they planned closures in each one of germany 's 16 states . the shut-downs come as the bundeswehr embarks on a reform that will reduce the number of troops from 280,000 to 250,000 by 2010 . us-like reform the changes are supposed to reflect the transformation the bundeswehr has undergone from a national guard to an army serving in peace missions around the world .
there are more than 2,000 german troops currently serving in the nato peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .

in addition , mobilizing troops takes too long , say critics , a major problem when rapid troop deployment in crisis regions is called for . cuts make locals nervous in addition to the 35,000 soldiers cut from the army , the bundeswehr plans to eliminate 10,000 civilian jobs . talk of cuts has been a political hot potato in recent months , especially with the announcment by washington last summer that it will withdraw a large portion of its 70,000 troop contingent stationed in germany . residents of the cities in which the bases were located had protested possible closures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.11.2004 stand-off in ukrainian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko says he 's confident of success early results from sunday 's presidential election in ukraine point to a run-off vote next month between the two main candidates for president . as the count approached completion monday , the current president 's chosen successor , prime minister viktor yanukovich , clung to a one percent lead over pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko , but neither man took the 50 percent needed to win outright in the first round .
the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovych yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , 54 , meanwhile , put the focus on material benefits , promising citizens that he would improve their standard of living , a message which resonates in a country where average monthly salaries average around $ 60 -lrb- € 47 -rrb- .
he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .
the run-off is expected to take place on nov .

foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .
foreigners appear to be no different , perhaps explaining why an unprecedented number of governments have decided to take sides in the contest for the white house . brushing aside concerns of meddling in american domestic affairs , china on monday joined the swelling ranks of nations offering their opinion on the presidential race . beijing broke its practice of not commenting on us presidential candidates and chastised bush for his foreign policies .
in a rare commentary , former vice-premier and former longtime foreign minister qian qichen criticized bush 's war on iraq .
he accused an " arrogant " united states of trying to " rule the world " and blamed the us-led invasion for sparking an increase in terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qian qichen " the philosophy of the ' bush doctrine ' is in essence force , " qian said in the government-run english-language china daily .

" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .

howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .

the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .

he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .

yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .

yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .

the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovych yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , 54 , meanwhile , put the focus on material benefits , promising citizens that he would improve their standard of living , a message which resonates in a country where average monthly salaries average around $ 60 -lrb- € 47 -rrb- .
he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .
the run-off is expected to take place on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.11.2004 stand-off in ukrainian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko says he 's confident of success early results from sunday 's presidential election in ukraine point to a run-off vote next month between the two main candidates for president . as the count approached completion monday , the current president 's chosen successor , prime minister viktor yanukovich , clung to a one percent lead over pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko , but neither man took the 50 percent needed to win outright in the first round .
the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovych yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , 54 , meanwhile , put the focus on material benefits , promising citizens that he would improve their standard of living , a message which resonates in a country where average monthly salaries average around $ 60 -lrb- € 47 -rrb- .
he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .
the run-off is expected to take place on nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.11.2004 best of the blogs awards enter the final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vote for the best weblog at www.thebobs.de deutsche welle ’ s 2004 best of the blogs awards moves into the final round of its international weblog competition . all the candidates for deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international weblog are ready to advance to the next stage , the final round .
starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .
anyone who chooses to take part will also be able to enter a lottery for a canon digital camera and other prizes . the international panel of experts meets in bonn , germany , at the end of november to decide which candidates get the jury prize , and all bobs winners will be announced on dec .
6 . sponsored by typepad and maritim hotels deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international weblog awards are being supported by typepad , sixapart ’ s blog services .
typepad is a blog provider that gives users a rich set of features to immediately share and publish the information they want .

though the new german military might not need them , local residents are nervous . a military spokesman confirmed sunday that germany 's bundeswehr will shut down more than 105 military bases as part of an overall plan to trim down the country 's military forces . the announcement , which will be made official by german defense minister peter struck in berlin on tuesday , ends weeks of speculation on the fate of the bases . military officials said last week that they planned closures in each one of germany 's 16 states . the shut-downs come as the bundeswehr embarks on a reform that will reduce the number of troops from 280,000 to 250,000 by 2010 . us-like reform the changes are supposed to reflect the transformation the bundeswehr has undergone from a national guard to an army serving in peace missions around the world .
there are more than 2,000 german troops currently serving in the nato peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
an additional 5,000 troops are stationed in the balkans .
struck , echoing a modern military philosophy shared in washington , has repeatedly said he wants his military smaller , more specialized and able to deploy quickly . germany 's larger role on the world stage , evident by its ambitions of winning a permanent seat on the un security council , has meant more is expected of the country than the " checkbook diplomacy " former chancellor helmut kohl exercised in the persian gulf war in 1991 . current military structures make the sort of long-term missions currently required of german troops by nato and the european union in central asia and the balkans difficult .
in addition , mobilizing troops takes too long , say critics , a major problem when rapid troop deployment in crisis regions is called for . cuts make locals nervous in addition to the 35,000 soldiers cut from the army , the bundeswehr plans to eliminate 10,000 civilian jobs . talk of cuts has been a political hot potato in recent months , especially with the announcment by washington last summer that it will withdraw a large portion of its 70,000 troop contingent stationed in germany . residents of the cities in which the bases were located had protested possible closures .

the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovych yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , 54 , meanwhile , put the focus on material benefits , promising citizens that he would improve their standard of living , a message which resonates in a country where average monthly salaries average around $ 60 -lrb- € 47 -rrb- .
he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .

the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovych yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , 54 , meanwhile , put the focus on material benefits , promising citizens that he would improve their standard of living , a message which resonates in a country where average monthly salaries average around $ 60 -lrb- € 47 -rrb- .
he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .
the run-off is expected to take place on nov .

foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .

" while backing bush 's anti-terrorism efforts , china opposed the war in iraq and sees the us administration 's policies as an example of superpower hegemony , which beijing frequently rails against .
" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .
russian president vladimir putin recently tacitly threw his support behind the texan by implying terrorists would prefer that bush be booted from office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard australia 's prime minister john howard has also strongly backed the bush administration 's uncompromising war on terror , however , his comments urging bush 's re-election has elicited criticism both at home and in america . australia 's opposition called on howard on monday to publicly retract comments he made hoping bush would win the us election .
howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2004 as germany 's role changes , so does military großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr : coming to a crisis region near you the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .
though the new german military might not need them , local residents are nervous . a military spokesman confirmed sunday that germany 's bundeswehr will shut down more than 105 military bases as part of an overall plan to trim down the country 's military forces . the announcement , which will be made official by german defense minister peter struck in berlin on tuesday , ends weeks of speculation on the fate of the bases . military officials said last week that they planned closures in each one of germany 's 16 states . the shut-downs come as the bundeswehr embarks on a reform that will reduce the number of troops from 280,000 to 250,000 by 2010 . us-like reform the changes are supposed to reflect the transformation the bundeswehr has undergone from a national guard to an army serving in peace missions around the world .
there are more than 2,000 german troops currently serving in the nato peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .
anyone who chooses to take part will also be able to enter a lottery for a canon digital camera and other prizes . the international panel of experts meets in bonn , germany , at the end of november to decide which candidates get the jury prize , and all bobs winners will be announced on dec .

though the new german military might not need them , local residents are nervous . a military spokesman confirmed sunday that germany 's bundeswehr will shut down more than 105 military bases as part of an overall plan to trim down the country 's military forces . the announcement , which will be made official by german defense minister peter struck in berlin on tuesday , ends weeks of speculation on the fate of the bases . military officials said last week that they planned closures in each one of germany 's 16 states . the shut-downs come as the bundeswehr embarks on a reform that will reduce the number of troops from 280,000 to 250,000 by 2010 . us-like reform the changes are supposed to reflect the transformation the bundeswehr has undergone from a national guard to an army serving in peace missions around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe current affairs -pipe- 01.11.2004 foreign governments take sides in us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i have china 's support , i hear russia is backing you ? "
foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .
foreigners appear to be no different , perhaps explaining why an unprecedented number of governments have decided to take sides in the contest for the white house . brushing aside concerns of meddling in american domestic affairs , china on monday joined the swelling ranks of nations offering their opinion on the presidential race . beijing broke its practice of not commenting on us presidential candidates and chastised bush for his foreign policies .
in a rare commentary , former vice-premier and former longtime foreign minister qian qichen criticized bush 's war on iraq .
he accused an " arrogant " united states of trying to " rule the world " and blamed the us-led invasion for sparking an increase in terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qian qichen " the philosophy of the ' bush doctrine ' is in essence force , " qian said in the government-run english-language china daily .
" it advocates the united states should rule over the whole world with overwhelming force , military force in particular . " while backing bush 's anti-terrorism efforts , china opposed the war in iraq and sees the us administration 's policies as an example of superpower hegemony , which beijing frequently rails against .
" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .
russian president vladimir putin recently tacitly threw his support behind the texan by implying terrorists would prefer that bush be booted from office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard australia 's prime minister john howard has also strongly backed the bush administration 's uncompromising war on terror , however , his comments urging bush 's re-election has elicited criticism both at home and in america . australia 's opposition called on howard on monday to publicly retract comments he made hoping bush would win the us election .
howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .
but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe current affairs -pipe- 01.11.2004 foreign governments take sides in us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i have china 's support , i hear russia is backing you ? "
foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .
foreigners appear to be no different , perhaps explaining why an unprecedented number of governments have decided to take sides in the contest for the white house . brushing aside concerns of meddling in american domestic affairs , china on monday joined the swelling ranks of nations offering their opinion on the presidential race . beijing broke its practice of not commenting on us presidential candidates and chastised bush for his foreign policies .
in a rare commentary , former vice-premier and former longtime foreign minister qian qichen criticized bush 's war on iraq .
he accused an " arrogant " united states of trying to " rule the world " and blamed the us-led invasion for sparking an increase in terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qian qichen " the philosophy of the ' bush doctrine ' is in essence force , " qian said in the government-run english-language china daily .
" it advocates the united states should rule over the whole world with overwhelming force , military force in particular . " while backing bush 's anti-terrorism efforts , china opposed the war in iraq and sees the us administration 's policies as an example of superpower hegemony , which beijing frequently rails against .
" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .
russian president vladimir putin recently tacitly threw his support behind the texan by implying terrorists would prefer that bush be booted from office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard australia 's prime minister john howard has also strongly backed the bush administration 's uncompromising war on terror , however , his comments urging bush 's re-election has elicited criticism both at home and in america . australia 's opposition called on howard on monday to publicly retract comments he made hoping bush would win the us election .
howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .
but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest .

though the new german military might not need them , local residents are nervous . a military spokesman confirmed sunday that germany 's bundeswehr will shut down more than 105 military bases as part of an overall plan to trim down the country 's military forces . the announcement , which will be made official by german defense minister peter struck in berlin on tuesday , ends weeks of speculation on the fate of the bases . military officials said last week that they planned closures in each one of germany 's 16 states . the shut-downs come as the bundeswehr embarks on a reform that will reduce the number of troops from 280,000 to 250,000 by 2010 . us-like reform the changes are supposed to reflect the transformation the bundeswehr has undergone from a national guard to an army serving in peace missions around the world .
there are more than 2,000 german troops currently serving in the nato peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
an additional 5,000 troops are stationed in the balkans .
struck , echoing a modern military philosophy shared in washington , has repeatedly said he wants his military smaller , more specialized and able to deploy quickly . germany 's larger role on the world stage , evident by its ambitions of winning a permanent seat on the un security council , has meant more is expected of the country than the " checkbook diplomacy " former chancellor helmut kohl exercised in the persian gulf war in 1991 . current military structures make the sort of long-term missions currently required of german troops by nato and the european union in central asia and the balkans difficult .
in addition , mobilizing troops takes too long , say critics , a major problem when rapid troop deployment in crisis regions is called for . cuts make locals nervous in addition to the 35,000 soldiers cut from the army , the bundeswehr plans to eliminate 10,000 civilian jobs . talk of cuts has been a political hot potato in recent months , especially with the announcment by washington last summer that it will withdraw a large portion of its 70,000 troop contingent stationed in germany . residents of the cities in which the bases were located had protested possible closures .

in addition , mobilizing troops takes too long , say critics , a major problem when rapid troop deployment in crisis regions is called for . cuts make locals nervous in addition to the 35,000 soldiers cut from the army , the bundeswehr plans to eliminate 10,000 civilian jobs . talk of cuts has been a political hot potato in recent months , especially with the announcment by washington last summer that it will withdraw a large portion of its 70,000 troop contingent stationed in germany . residents of the cities in which the bases were located had protested possible closures .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .
anyone who chooses to take part will also be able to enter a lottery for a canon digital camera and other prizes . the international panel of experts meets in bonn , germany , at the end of november to decide which candidates get the jury prize , and all bobs winners will be announced on dec .
6 . sponsored by typepad and maritim hotels deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international weblog awards are being supported by typepad , sixapart ’ s blog services .
typepad is a blog provider that gives users a rich set of features to immediately share and publish the information they want .

he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .

even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .

foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .
foreigners appear to be no different , perhaps explaining why an unprecedented number of governments have decided to take sides in the contest for the white house . brushing aside concerns of meddling in american domestic affairs , china on monday joined the swelling ranks of nations offering their opinion on the presidential race . beijing broke its practice of not commenting on us presidential candidates and chastised bush for his foreign policies .
in a rare commentary , former vice-premier and former longtime foreign minister qian qichen criticized bush 's war on iraq .
he accused an " arrogant " united states of trying to " rule the world " and blamed the us-led invasion for sparking an increase in terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qian qichen " the philosophy of the ' bush doctrine ' is in essence force , " qian said in the government-run english-language china daily .
" it advocates the united states should rule over the whole world with overwhelming force , military force in particular . " while backing bush 's anti-terrorism efforts , china opposed the war in iraq and sees the us administration 's policies as an example of superpower hegemony , which beijing frequently rails against .
" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .
russian president vladimir putin recently tacitly threw his support behind the texan by implying terrorists would prefer that bush be booted from office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard australia 's prime minister john howard has also strongly backed the bush administration 's uncompromising war on terror , however , his comments urging bush 's re-election has elicited criticism both at home and in america . australia 's opposition called on howard on monday to publicly retract comments he made hoping bush would win the us election .
howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 01.11.2004 best of the blogs awards enter the final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vote for the best weblog at www.thebobs.de deutsche welle ’ s 2004 best of the blogs awards moves into the final round of its international weblog competition . all the candidates for deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international weblog are ready to advance to the next stage , the final round .
starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .
anyone who chooses to take part will also be able to enter a lottery for a canon digital camera and other prizes . the international panel of experts meets in bonn , germany , at the end of november to decide which candidates get the jury prize , and all bobs winners will be announced on dec .
6 . sponsored by typepad and maritim hotels deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international weblog awards are being supported by typepad , sixapart ’ s blog services .
typepad is a blog provider that gives users a rich set of features to immediately share and publish the information they want .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush an overwhelming case for germany ? former us treasurer campaigns for kerry kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe current affairs -pipe- 01.11.2004 foreign governments take sides in us vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i have china 's support , i hear russia is backing you ? "
foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .
foreigners appear to be no different , perhaps explaining why an unprecedented number of governments have decided to take sides in the contest for the white house . brushing aside concerns of meddling in american domestic affairs , china on monday joined the swelling ranks of nations offering their opinion on the presidential race . beijing broke its practice of not commenting on us presidential candidates and chastised bush for his foreign policies .
in a rare commentary , former vice-premier and former longtime foreign minister qian qichen criticized bush 's war on iraq .
he accused an " arrogant " united states of trying to " rule the world " and blamed the us-led invasion for sparking an increase in terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qian qichen " the philosophy of the ' bush doctrine ' is in essence force , " qian said in the government-run english-language china daily .
" it advocates the united states should rule over the whole world with overwhelming force , military force in particular . " while backing bush 's anti-terrorism efforts , china opposed the war in iraq and sees the us administration 's policies as an example of superpower hegemony , which beijing frequently rails against .
" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .
russian president vladimir putin recently tacitly threw his support behind the texan by implying terrorists would prefer that bush be booted from office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard australia 's prime minister john howard has also strongly backed the bush administration 's uncompromising war on terror , however , his comments urging bush 's re-election has elicited criticism both at home and in america . australia 's opposition called on howard on monday to publicly retract comments he made hoping bush would win the us election .
howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .
but with so many people across the eu considering the stakes this year especially high , the european press has put particular focus on the contest .

the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .

he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .

he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .

monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .

he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .
anyone who chooses to take part will also be able to enter a lottery for a canon digital camera and other prizes . the international panel of experts meets in bonn , germany , at the end of november to decide which candidates get the jury prize , and all bobs winners will be announced on dec .
6 . sponsored by typepad and maritim hotels deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international weblog awards are being supported by typepad , sixapart ’ s blog services .
typepad is a blog provider that gives users a rich set of features to immediately share and publish the information they want .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .
anyone who chooses to take part will also be able to enter a lottery for a canon digital camera and other prizes . the international panel of experts meets in bonn , germany , at the end of november to decide which candidates get the jury prize , and all bobs winners will be announced on dec .
6 . sponsored by typepad and maritim hotels deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international weblog awards are being supported by typepad , sixapart ’ s blog services .
typepad is a blog provider that gives users a rich set of features to immediately share and publish the information they want .

"
foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .
foreigners appear to be no different , perhaps explaining why an unprecedented number of governments have decided to take sides in the contest for the white house . brushing aside concerns of meddling in american domestic affairs , china on monday joined the swelling ranks of nations offering their opinion on the presidential race . beijing broke its practice of not commenting on us presidential candidates and chastised bush for his foreign policies .
in a rare commentary , former vice-premier and former longtime foreign minister qian qichen criticized bush 's war on iraq .
he accused an " arrogant " united states of trying to " rule the world " and blamed the us-led invasion for sparking an increase in terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qian qichen " the philosophy of the ' bush doctrine ' is in essence force , " qian said in the government-run english-language china daily .
" it advocates the united states should rule over the whole world with overwhelming force , military force in particular . " while backing bush 's anti-terrorism efforts , china opposed the war in iraq and sees the us administration 's policies as an example of superpower hegemony , which beijing frequently rails against .
" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .
russian president vladimir putin recently tacitly threw his support behind the texan by implying terrorists would prefer that bush be booted from office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard australia 's prime minister john howard has also strongly backed the bush administration 's uncompromising war on terror , however , his comments urging bush 's re-election has elicited criticism both at home and in america . australia 's opposition called on howard on monday to publicly retract comments he made hoping bush would win the us election .
howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .

he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2004 as germany 's role changes , so does military großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundeswehr : coming to a crisis region near you the german defense minister is expected this week to announce the closure of 105 bundeswehr bases .
though the new german military might not need them , local residents are nervous . a military spokesman confirmed sunday that germany 's bundeswehr will shut down more than 105 military bases as part of an overall plan to trim down the country 's military forces . the announcement , which will be made official by german defense minister peter struck in berlin on tuesday , ends weeks of speculation on the fate of the bases . military officials said last week that they planned closures in each one of germany 's 16 states . the shut-downs come as the bundeswehr embarks on a reform that will reduce the number of troops from 280,000 to 250,000 by 2010 . us-like reform the changes are supposed to reflect the transformation the bundeswehr has undergone from a national guard to an army serving in peace missions around the world .
there are more than 2,000 german troops currently serving in the nato peacekeeping mission in afghanistan .
an additional 5,000 troops are stationed in the balkans .
struck , echoing a modern military philosophy shared in washington , has repeatedly said he wants his military smaller , more specialized and able to deploy quickly . germany 's larger role on the world stage , evident by its ambitions of winning a permanent seat on the un security council , has meant more is expected of the country than the " checkbook diplomacy " former chancellor helmut kohl exercised in the persian gulf war in 1991 . current military structures make the sort of long-term missions currently required of german troops by nato and the european union in central asia and the balkans difficult .
in addition , mobilizing troops takes too long , say critics , a major problem when rapid troop deployment in crisis regions is called for . cuts make locals nervous in addition to the 35,000 soldiers cut from the army , the bundeswehr plans to eliminate 10,000 civilian jobs . talk of cuts has been a political hot potato in recent months , especially with the announcment by washington last summer that it will withdraw a large portion of its 70,000 troop contingent stationed in germany . residents of the cities in which the bases were located had protested possible closures .
as in the case of us and british military camps in southern germany , the bundeswehr barracks and camps help support local economies . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struck criticized over timing of army cuts german defense minister peter struck is pushing through the most radical reform of the german army to date despite the impending massive us troop withdrawal from germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.11.2004 stand-off in ukrainian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko says he 's confident of success early results from sunday 's presidential election in ukraine point to a run-off vote next month between the two main candidates for president . as the count approached completion monday , the current president 's chosen successor , prime minister viktor yanukovich , clung to a one percent lead over pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko , but neither man took the 50 percent needed to win outright in the first round .
the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovych yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , 54 , meanwhile , put the focus on material benefits , promising citizens that he would improve their standard of living , a message which resonates in a country where average monthly salaries average around $ 60 -lrb- € 47 -rrb- .
he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .
the run-off is expected to take place on nov .

the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .

he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .
at a recent rally , he referred to them as " bastards preventing us from living normally . "
on a visit to western ukraine , a stronghold of the opposition , yanukovich was hit with a rotten egg and after an opposition rally in kiev , minor skirmishes broke out .
authorities said they would use force and declare a state of emergency if there were a threat to public order in the days leading up to and on election day .
fairness in doubt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president leonid kuchma the media was also criticized as being biased toward yanukovich .
since the majority of the main television channels are pro-government , and outgoing president kuchma -lrb- photo -rrb- threw his support behind yanukovich , the opposition standard bearer had difficulty getting air time .
yushchenko called on his supporters " not to stay silent " if they saw irregularities during the election and accused the authorities of trying to buy votes .
" this election is the dirtiest , most immoral and dishonest of all post-soviet campaigns in ukraine , " independent analyst volodymyr polokhalo told reuters recently .
" sunday 's outcome is a clear setback for yanukovich , who clearly expected another result , " he said monday .
the run-off is expected to take place on nov .

the government 's lack of action and disinterest is no longer acceptable given increasing gas prices , he said .
the mineral-oil industry estimates the loss of tax revenues at a billion euros , kretschmer said .
while other countries have taken on the problem directly - for example , northern italy has a special eu exception until 2006 allowing for lower taxes to combat cheap gas sold in switzerland and slovenia - berlin has only tried to get the eu to institute an increase in the lowest tax bracket , he complained . more briefs 01.11.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler may open russia plant 01.11.2004 -pipe- gm 's opel said to have a future in germany 29.10.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn is slow to pay bills , firms say 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler allegedly probed over secret bank accounts 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler stands by smart 28.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler steers back into profit 28.10.2004 -pipe- altana suffers setback in launch of asthma drugs 28.10.2004 -pipe- hypovereinsbank buys portfolio from ing bhf radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in addition , mobilizing troops takes too long , say critics , a major problem when rapid troop deployment in crisis regions is called for . cuts make locals nervous in addition to the 35,000 soldiers cut from the army , the bundeswehr plans to eliminate 10,000 civilian jobs . talk of cuts has been a political hot potato in recent months , especially with the announcment by washington last summer that it will withdraw a large portion of its 70,000 troop contingent stationed in germany . residents of the cities in which the bases were located had protested possible closures .

"
foreign governments traditionally remain neutral during us election campaigns , but this year several leaders and governments around the world are either directly or implicitly supporting george bush or john kerry . love him or loathe him , us president george bush evokes strong emotions in most americans .
foreigners appear to be no different , perhaps explaining why an unprecedented number of governments have decided to take sides in the contest for the white house . brushing aside concerns of meddling in american domestic affairs , china on monday joined the swelling ranks of nations offering their opinion on the presidential race . beijing broke its practice of not commenting on us presidential candidates and chastised bush for his foreign policies .
in a rare commentary , former vice-premier and former longtime foreign minister qian qichen criticized bush 's war on iraq .
he accused an " arrogant " united states of trying to " rule the world " and blamed the us-led invasion for sparking an increase in terrorist attacks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : qian qichen " the philosophy of the ' bush doctrine ' is in essence force , " qian said in the government-run english-language china daily .
" it advocates the united states should rule over the whole world with overwhelming force , military force in particular . " while backing bush 's anti-terrorism efforts , china opposed the war in iraq and sees the us administration 's policies as an example of superpower hegemony , which beijing frequently rails against .
" the current us predicament in iraq serves as another example that when a country 's superiority psychology inflates beyond its real capability , a lot of trouble can be caused , " qian said . backing bush bush may be overwhelmingly unpopular overseas , but he does have the support of a significant number or world leaders .
italy 's silvio berlusconi and japan 's junichiro koizumi have warm ties with bush and both backed his decision to invade iraq .
russian president vladimir putin recently tacitly threw his support behind the texan by implying terrorists would prefer that bush be booted from office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : australian prime minister john howard australia 's prime minister john howard has also strongly backed the bush administration 's uncompromising war on terror , however , his comments urging bush 's re-election has elicited criticism both at home and in america . australia 's opposition called on howard on monday to publicly retract comments he made hoping bush would win the us election .
howard 's comment was earlier criticized by a top adviser to democratic challenger john kerry as " inappropriate " and interference in the united states ' domestic affairs . kerry famously came under fire by the bush campaign this summer for saying foreign leaders had told him they hoped he would unseat the president .
kerry refused to name names , however , it is widely accepted several european leaders would like to see bush shown the door . france 's president jacques chirac certainly has no love lost for bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder long had extremely icy ties with washington .
bush even when so far as to snub the german by not offering his congratulations after schröder was reelected in 2002 . but a kerry victory could make life complicated for both chirac and schröder since he has said if elected he would push for greater international involvement in iraq , increasing pressure on paris and berlin to contribute troops to help stabilize the troubled country . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european media offers advice on us vote us presidential elections are always a big story for the world 's media .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .

starting monday more than 100 blogs , in 11 categories will be put to the test , by both a jury of blog experts and users around the world , who can vote online to give their favorite sites a bob - best of the blogs . with over 1,000 weblog suggestions , the evaluation process was “ two weeks of hard work and pure stress , ” according to jury member and german blog expert jörg kantel .
he and the other nine jury members had to choose , with the help of the dw-world.de ’ s weblog team , which of the weblogs would make it into the final round . “ it really wasn ’ t an easy job , we had a lot of excellent blogs to choose from , ” fellow jury member konstantin klein said .
“ there were heavy hitting bloggers as well as a lot of newcomers ; it really wasn ’ t easy for us to agree on just 10 candidates per category . ” very different blogospheres “ mainstream journalism around the world is taking more and more of an interest in weblogs , ” said holger hank , editorial director for dw-world.de , deutsche welle ’ s internet site .
“ this is the first time a competition has looked at the international blog scene . ” it was particularly interesting to see that despite all the similarities of blogs around the world , it ’ s still possible to pick out regional trends , hank added .
in the united states , the weblog scene has been professionalized to the point where bloggers make money with their entries , while blogging for cash in germany is still unheard of . “ the german blogosphere is very focused on itself at the moment , ” hank said .
“ there is a lack of well-written german blogs dealing with the day ’ s hot-button issues like globalization , social reforms or terrorism . ” different cultures have different concerns there ’ s a clear trend toward bloggers talking about other blogs in the spanish speaking world , according to communications scientist jose luis orihuela . “ in the spanish blog scene we ’ ve seen a trend toward developing a community , ” he said .
“ this is driven by the growing number of portals , rankings and tools available to bloggers . ” chinese bloggers , on the other hand , have taken quite a different tack .
they tend to concentrate on personal matters . “ it ’ s much more of a typical diary , just online , ” said star blogger li li , who is known to the blogosphere as the chinese sex blogger mu zimei . the lack of political issues in chinese blogs is the result of the limited freedom of expression , hank said .
even journalists seldom mention political topics in their blogs as a way of not upsetting the government .
but many chinese bloggers are proving that the internet is an excellent way to get around government regulations . vote and win the jury nominated 10 blogs in 11 categories , and they are all ready to be put under the loop .
while one bob per language will be awarded to the best journalism blog in each of the competition ’ s seven languages -lrb- arabic , chinese , english , german , portuguese , russian and spanish -rrb- the nominees from all languages will be thrown together to fight it out for one jury prize each in the best weblog , best topic , best design and best innovation categories . but bloggers won ’ t just be trying to impress the jury .
all internet users will have until dec .
5 to vote for their favorite blog in each of the 11 categories , with one user award , along with international bragging rights , being given out the public ’ s favorite . dw-world.de has made sure there ’ s plenty of reason to participate .
anyone who chooses to take part will also be able to enter a lottery for a canon digital camera and other prizes . the international panel of experts meets in bonn , germany , at the end of november to decide which candidates get the jury prize , and all bobs winners will be announced on dec .
6 . sponsored by typepad and maritim hotels deutsche welle ’ s 2004 international weblog awards are being supported by typepad , sixapart ’ s blog services .
typepad is a blog provider that gives users a rich set of features to immediately share and publish the information they want .

at vw 's factory in braunschweig , northern germany , close to 3,000 workers downed tools for four hours overnight , with demonstrations staged at different gates of the factory , the ig metall labor union said .
similar walkouts were staged at vw 's other sites in kassel , central germany , and the northern plants of salzgitter , emden and wolfsburg .
the so-called friedenspflicht deadline , banning industrial action during wage negotiations , ended last thursday and already on friday 4,000 workers walked off the job temporarily .
as management and unions met for a sixth round of wage talks on monday , both sides showed signs of digging in their heels .
europe 's biggest car maker is seeking a two-year wage freeze for the 103,000 staff on german assembly lines and a 30 percent reduction in labor costs by 2011 .
ig metall , for its part , is demanding job guarantees for 10 years and a 4-percent increase in wages . more briefs 01.11.2004 -pipe- cdu lodges " tank tourism " complaint 01.11.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler may open russia plant 01.11.2004 -pipe- gm 's opel said to have a future in germany 29.10.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn is slow to pay bills , firms say 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler allegedly probed over secret bank accounts 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler stands by smart 28.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler steers back into profit 28.10.2004 -pipe- altana suffers setback in launch of asthma drugs radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the past weeks have seen much media speculation as to which plant - the one in rüsselsheim , germany , or in trollhättan , western sweden - would be shut down as a result of planned restructuring .
on sunday , swedish daily dagens nyheter quoted a gm insider as saying the german firm would be selected to produce gm 's next generation of middle-class cars , thus sparing it from a shut-down .
germany 's opel plant was selected over sweden 's saab factory because it is more centrally located , the report said .
but a speaker for opel said the report was purely speculative .
gm recently said it wanted to cut 12 , 000 jobs in europe most of which would be from germany .
the report also claimed the saab factory would not be closed down , but instead a new luxury car would be made there . dw-world.de is the end nigh for opel ?
as restructuring talks continue , opel 's works council and us parent company general motors are considering a possible merger of gm 's european subsidiaries .

" the -lrb- social democratic-green party -rrb- coalition should finally follow the example of other eu countries and act " against the growing phenomenon , cdu representative michael kretschmer told the dpa news agency .
the government 's lack of action and disinterest is no longer acceptable given increasing gas prices , he said .
the mineral-oil industry estimates the loss of tax revenues at a billion euros , kretschmer said .
while other countries have taken on the problem directly - for example , northern italy has a special eu exception until 2006 allowing for lower taxes to combat cheap gas sold in switzerland and slovenia - berlin has only tried to get the eu to institute an increase in the lowest tax bracket , he complained . more briefs 01.11.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler may open russia plant 01.11.2004 -pipe- gm 's opel said to have a future in germany 29.10.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn is slow to pay bills , firms say 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler allegedly probed over secret bank accounts 29.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler stands by smart 28.10.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler steers back into profit 28.10.2004 -pipe- altana suffers setback in launch of asthma drugs 28.10.2004 -pipe- hypovereinsbank buys portfolio from ing bhf radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.11.2004 stand-off in ukrainian election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko says he 's confident of success early results from sunday 's presidential election in ukraine point to a run-off vote next month between the two main candidates for president . as the count approached completion monday , the current president 's chosen successor , prime minister viktor yanukovich , clung to a one percent lead over pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko , but neither man took the 50 percent needed to win outright in the first round .
the outcome of the expected run-off could decide whether the former soviet state turns east or west , with the candidates offering ukrainians the choice of either intensifying links with moscow or moving gradually towards the west .
after the european union issued several calls for ukraine to ensure a fair and free contest , the osce sent one of its largest election observation missions ever .
monitors say sunday 's election failed to meet international standards , reporting irregularities such as voter intimidation and people left off lists and therefore unable to vote . ukrainian authorities had placed security forces on high alert , with the building of the elections commission sealed off in case of rioting . dirty tricks ukrainians were able to choose among 24 candidates , but the real battle for the presidency is between prime minister viktor yanukovich , backed by president leonid kuchma , and liberal challenger viktor yushchenko .
the campaign was marred by accusations of dirty tricks by both sides , with yushchenko falling ill several weeks ago in what he claims was an attempt to poison him .
a center-right member of the our ukraine party , he was ahead in the polls early on , but the mysterious illness forced him to go to austria for treatment and take a month off the campaign trail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yanukovych yanukovich -lrb- photo -rrb- , 54 , meanwhile , put the focus on material benefits , promising citizens that he would improve their standard of living , a message which resonates in a country where average monthly salaries average around $ 60 -lrb- € 47 -rrb- .
he increased pensions last month and has promised public sector employees , teachers and health care workers they will get more money as well .
he has said he will improve the country 's infrastructure , which has been in decline since the collapse of the soviet union .
yanukovich has found a powerful ally in russian president vladimir putin , who came to the capital , kiev , for the 60th anniversary of the country 's liberation from nazi occupation .
putin took part in a live phone-in show on three channels of ukrainian tv , an unprecedented event , where he praised the prime minister , although stopped short of an official endorsement .
the message , however , was clear .
liberal opposition leader yushchenko described the visit as " untimely , " one of the more diplomatic accusations flying from both sides .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko yushchenko , a former prime minister and central bank chief , has promised to move ukraine closer to the west if he is elected and pledged political and economic reform .
he has said ukrainians could enjoy living standards of nearby poland and the czech republic .
nasty tone the poisoning accusation is only one of many which the two camps exchanged in a campaign that grew increasingly vitriolic as election day approached .
yanukovich accused yushchenko and his supporters of preparing to resort to violence if they lost .

a tumour can grow only if its blood supply also expands to provide it with essential nutrients .
the protein , discovered by bristol university researchers , appears to block the growth of blood vessels past a certain size .
the researchers hope their work , published in cancer research , will lead to new cancer treatments .
the key protein is one of a group known as vascular endothelial growth factors -lrb- vegf -rrb- .
most forms of vegf stimulate blood vessel growth , including the new vessels formed as a tumour begins to develop .
however , the bristol team have identified a form called vegf 165b , which appears to have the opposite effect by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels required for tumours to grow above one millimetre in size .
the researchers have also found that this form of vegf is generally found in many normal parts of the body , including the prostate , but not in prostate cancer .
starvation they hope it may eventually be possible to use vegf 165b to prevent tumour growth by effectively starving it of nutrients .
the bristol team believe that the fact that the protein is produced naturally by the body could make it more effective than other anti-cancer agents .
many new cancer therapies are based on starving the tumour of nutrients by attacking the tumour blood supply rather than the cancer cells .
blocking vegf using antibodies has recently been shown to be effective in large-scale trials in colorectal cancer in the us .
new blood vessel growth is also necessary for many normal body functions .
these include the development of the embryo and , in adults , wound healing , the development of the placenta in pregnancy and of muscles during physical training programmes .
however , it is thought that adults can live healthily without blood vessel growth for extended periods of time .
this blood vessel growth is controlled by many factors , but vegf is the most powerful factor .
researcher dr dave bates said : " now that we have found out that this protein works in living tissues , we need to find the best way of using it in cancer , with tumour models .
" we also need to try it in models of other diseases where blood vessel growth is necessary , such as diabetes , age-related macular degeneration and arthritis . "

blocking vegf using antibodies has recently been shown to be effective in large-scale trials in colorectal cancer in the us .
new blood vessel growth is also necessary for many normal body functions .
these include the development of the embryo and , in adults , wound healing , the development of the placenta in pregnancy and of muscles during physical training programmes .
however , it is thought that adults can live healthily without blood vessel growth for extended periods of time .
this blood vessel growth is controlled by many factors , but vegf is the most powerful factor .
researcher dr dave bates said : " now that we have found out that this protein works in living tissues , we need to find the best way of using it in cancer , with tumour models .
" we also need to try it in models of other diseases where blood vessel growth is necessary , such as diabetes , age-related macular degeneration and arthritis . "

a tumour can grow only if its blood supply also expands to provide it with essential nutrients .
the protein , discovered by bristol university researchers , appears to block the growth of blood vessels past a certain size .
the researchers hope their work , published in cancer research , will lead to new cancer treatments .
the key protein is one of a group known as vascular endothelial growth factors -lrb- vegf -rrb- .
most forms of vegf stimulate blood vessel growth , including the new vessels formed as a tumour begins to develop .
however , the bristol team have identified a form called vegf 165b , which appears to have the opposite effect by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels required for tumours to grow above one millimetre in size .
the researchers have also found that this form of vegf is generally found in many normal parts of the body , including the prostate , but not in prostate cancer .

hartlepool 's historic quay features the uk 's oldest warship still afloat , hms trincomalee , built in 1817 .
hartlepool borough council , which owns the historic quay site , wants to develop the area to better emphasise its nautical past .
the proposals are being discussed by the council 's cabinet at a meeting on monday .
among the projects being considered is a plan to create a visitor centre around the moored tall ship .
the authority wants to work closer with the hms trincomalee trust , which owns and maintains the vessel .
the ship has pride of place in the historic quay dock .
' unique attractions ' other proposals for the whole historic quay area include a radical relocation of the nearby paddle steamer wingfield castle .
stuart green , the council 's head of planning and economic development , said : " the trincomalee , the historic quay and its associated attractions are the jewels in hartlepool 's tourism crown .
" however , tourism is a highly competitive area , and to stay ahead of the competition we must always keep improving what we have to offer .
" these new ideas follow detailed discussions between ourselves and the trincomalee trust about how we can enhance our unique attractions and maximise their appeal to visitors from both home and abroad .
" the proposals would also complement the proposed multi-million pound redevelopment of the nearby victoria harbour and the ongoing development of the hartlepool marina area . "
bryn hughes , general manager of the hms trincomalee trust , added : " this is an exciting set of proposals that should reinforce hartlepool 's place firmly on the tourism map by combining the acknowledged strengths of both the trincomalee and the historic quay as award-winning attractions . "
it took more than a decade and £ 10m to restore the nelson-era frigate to its 19th century splendour in hartlepool .

among the projects being considered is a plan to create a visitor centre around the moored tall ship .
the authority wants to work closer with the hms trincomalee trust , which owns and maintains the vessel .
the ship has pride of place in the historic quay dock .
' unique attractions ' other proposals for the whole historic quay area include a radical relocation of the nearby paddle steamer wingfield castle .
stuart green , the council 's head of planning and economic development , said : " the trincomalee , the historic quay and its associated attractions are the jewels in hartlepool 's tourism crown .
the wingfield castle may be removed from the water " however , tourism is a highly competitive area , and to stay ahead of the competition we must always keep improving what we have to offer .
" these new ideas follow detailed discussions between ourselves and the trincomalee trust about how we can enhance our unique attractions and maximise their appeal to visitors from both home and abroad .
" the proposals would also complement the proposed multi-million pound redevelopment of the nearby victoria harbour and the ongoing development of the hartlepool marina area . "
bryn hughes , general manager of the hms trincomalee trust , added : " this is an exciting set of proposals that should reinforce hartlepool 's place firmly on the tourism map by combining the acknowledged strengths of both the trincomalee and the historic quay as award-winning attractions . "
it took more than a decade and £ 10m to restore the nelson-era frigate to its 19th century splendour in hartlepool .
when work was completed in 2001 the world ship trust gave the hartlepool project its international maritime heritage award in recognition of its efforts .

at a conference in newport , industry representatives urged economic development minister andrew davies to continue to invest in promoting wales .
earlier this year , it was announced that the body would be integrated into the assembly government by 2006 .
delegates at the wales tourism alliance conference on monday were seeking assurances of continued support .
wta chair julian burrell said members were helping to devise a " road map " to reorganisation .
the tourist board was one of three quangos - quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations - which mr morgan said would definitely be taken under the umbrella of the welsh assembly in a so-called " bonfire of the quangos " .
others included the welsh development agency and the post-16 education body , elwa .
the work of three quangos will come under assembly control the changes were expected to dominate discussions at the third annual wta conference .
unions have expressed fears that jobs will be lost as a result of the changes , something mr morgan did not rule out .
mr burrell said : " conference 2004 forms a pivotal point in the discussions between the industry and the national assembly about the future direction of government support for tourism in wales following the decision by wag to take wtb in-house .
" every aspect of assembly-funded assistance , from international marketing campaigns to business grants , will be under new management .
" this conference is our members ' platform and they will assist the wta executive to produce a working partnership and help draw up the road map to reorganisation with the welsh assembly government . "
economic development minister andrew davies attended the conference on monday to bring the industry up-to-date with progress in absorbing the wtb .
mr burrell added : " tourism is easily wales ' biggest industry with a presence in all parts of wales .
" millions of pounds are spent each year by visitors on holidays , breaks and conferences and each one of them goes on to spend a lot of money in the nearby economic community . "
