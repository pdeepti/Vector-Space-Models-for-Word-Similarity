the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .

the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .

“ this is not an islamic country , it ’ s a christian country , and we should not be forced to accommodate islam . ” the headscarf also remains a sore spot because many consider it a symbol of fundamentalism and female discrimination in a western society . “ there are very few women who wear the head scarf voluntarily , and their number is so small they are not worth talking about , ” said seyran ates , a women ’ s rights activist and lawyer in berlin . " what we 're talking about is fundamentalism " the 40-year-old , who wrote a book about leaving her traditional turkish home in berlin , says she is astounded at the legitimacy with which some german politicians give the headscarf .
“ we need to never forget that what we ’ re talking about here is fundamentalism , ” she said . instead of deciding what place a piece of cloth that represents religious freedom to some , fundamentalism to others has in a state-run school , germany ’ s constitutional court referred the question to the state parliaments and the public domain - where many believe it belongs . “ we ’ re -lrb- as a society -rrb- not ready for such a decision , ” says riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .
referring to germany ’ s integration problems , spielhaus said “ we need an atmosphere of openness where we can accept that other religions might also change our values . “ how a headscarf ban produces terrorists the direction the debate is going worries both muslims and germans .

“ mrs. ludin ’ s head scarf , which she willingly puts on , is good for the western society .
banning head scarves would be a victory for fundamentalists . ” oztürk makes a similar argument , adding that her head scarf could even help dismantle prejudices before they arise in her young students . “ i think it ’ s very sad that this society continues to look at the head scarf as something of a threat , ” said oztürk .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .
if he loses this battle , the power of the tabloid press could soon see him swept out of office - that is , if he has n't already lost any hope of winning another election . klaus dahmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .

there is not one major german city where the spires of a mosque ca n't be seen reaching out among the housetops .
headscarves on the street have become as familiar as the sausage stand on the corner .
as their numbers grow , so does their desire to assert their presence .
for the most part , germany 's politicians have treated islam 's growing influence with gloved hands .
but the sept .
11 terrorist attacks and their roots in a small mosque in hamburg threw the community into sharper focus .
muslims responded by becoming more vocal and demonstrative in asserting their religious rights , sparking already simmering debates on the place the headscarf holds in german society and whether muslim parents have the right to bend school rules .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .
if he loses this battle , the power of the tabloid press could soon see him swept out of office - that is , if he has n't already lost any hope of winning another election . klaus dahmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .

" i personally feel that i have been cheated by the government of the republic of cyprus , " he told meps in strasbourg .
verheugen said that the decision in 1999 not to make a solution to the cyprus conflict a prerequisite for cypriot accession to the eu , was " on the understanding that the government of cyprus would do everything in its power to resolve the problem . "

the turkish and greek cypriot sides will go to the polls this saturday to vote on whether to accept the un blueprint for the island 's reunification before it joins the eu on may 1 .
verheugen made a last appeal to the cypriots to accept the plan as polls suggest that while a ' yes ' is expected in the turkish cypriot part , the greek cypriots are expected to reject the plan by a large margin .

the study predicted a migration potential of between 1 and 2.8 million people .
" the migration will be too minimal for it to noticeably influence salaries and jobs in an open market economy like germany 's , " the report reads .
it also pointed out that in the face of relatively low direct investment in the accession countries in the past years , there was no reason to expect that companies would move huge amounts of capital to the new eu member states .
" one can expect that eu enlargement will largely have positive effects for the new 25-member eu , " the diw study concluded . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- more german women opt to become their own bosses 21.04.2004 -pipe- german minister mulls easing shopping hours 21.04.2004 -pipe- eu threatens suit over germany 's can deposit law 20.04.2004 -pipe- spd , greens want more expensive air travel 20.04.2004 -pipe- more pessimism about german economic recovery 20.04.2004 -pipe- puma chases record profits 20.04.2004 -pipe- swiss names new ceo 19.04.2004 -pipe- germany 's iw institute cuts growth forecast radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

“ we need to never forget that what we ’ re talking about here is fundamentalism , ” she said . instead of deciding what place a piece of cloth that represents religious freedom to some , fundamentalism to others has in a state-run school , germany ’ s constitutional court referred the question to the state parliaments and the public domain - where many believe it belongs . “ we ’ re -lrb- as a society -rrb- not ready for such a decision , ” says riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .
referring to germany ’ s integration problems , spielhaus said “ we need an atmosphere of openness where we can accept that other religions might also change our values . “ how a headscarf ban produces terrorists the direction the debate is going worries both muslims and germans .

11 hijackers . others dismiss such ideas as scare tactics . “ there ’ s not a fundamentalist under every head scarf , and thinking that would be fatal , ” said spielhaus .
“ mrs. ludin ’ s head scarf , which she willingly puts on , is good for the western society .
banning head scarves would be a victory for fundamentalists . ” oztürk makes a similar argument , adding that her head scarf could even help dismantle prejudices before they arise in her young students . “ i think it ’ s very sad that this society continues to look at the head scarf as something of a threat , ” said oztürk .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .

teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english 9801 dw-tv europe live in focus we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

" i personally feel that i have been cheated by the government of the republic of cyprus , " he told meps in strasbourg .
verheugen said that the decision in 1999 not to make a solution to the cyprus conflict a prerequisite for cypriot accession to the eu , was " on the understanding that the government of cyprus would do everything in its power to resolve the problem . "
whilst the greek cypriot part will join the eu whatever the result , the turkish cypriot part will remain out in the cold if one of the sides rejects the plan .
" tassos papadopoulos surprised everybody by pursuing a rejection of the un plan , " verheugen said .
the turkish and greek cypriot sides will go to the polls this saturday to vote on whether to accept the un blueprint for the island 's reunification before it joins the eu on may 1 .
verheugen made a last appeal to the cypriots to accept the plan as polls suggest that while a ' yes ' is expected in the turkish cypriot part , the greek cypriots are expected to reject the plan by a large margin .
" never before have we been as close to a solution as now , " he said .
" we are just inches away from our objective .
but i have to say i have little hope left for our being able to push forward those remaining few inches . "

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .
if he loses this battle , the power of the tabloid press could soon see him swept out of office - that is , if he has n't already lost any hope of winning another election . klaus dahmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

for many , the government 's choice of the cologne economist came as a surprise . government officials officially nominated the 47-year-old university of cologne professor after a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel had proposed weber for the post tuesday night .
government sources have said that weber has already accepted the nomination . procedure requires the german president to name the central bank chief , who the bundesbank board of directors may not reject .
but the bank leaders may demand a hearing to determine whether weber is qualified for the job .
their evaluation of the economist would then be relayed confidentially to the government . " professor weber is well-known to the bundesbank , " a spokesman for the directors said on wednesday .
he is a member of the bundesbank research center 's advisory board and had been involved significantly in various conferences , the spokesman said , according to reuters .

the names of foreign ministry state secretaries alfred tacke and caio koch-weser and bundesbank deputy chief jürgen stark had all been bandied about by the media as possible candidates . the bundesbank refused to comment on rumors wednesday that jürgen stark , who is considered close to the opposition christian democratic union party , might resign from his position if he did n't become bank president . broad approval weber , who is neither a member of a political party nor aligned with one , has already received backing from across party lines and from throughout the economic community .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .
if he loses this battle , the power of the tabloid press could soon see him swept out of office - that is , if he has n't already lost any hope of winning another election . klaus dahmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

back to first page back 2/2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach “ the debate is absurd , ” says the domestic affairs expert for the conservative christian democrats in the german parliament -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ this is not an islamic country , it ’ s a christian country , and we should not be forced to accommodate islam . ” the headscarf also remains a sore spot because many consider it a symbol of fundamentalism and female discrimination in a western society . “ there are very few women who wear the head scarf voluntarily , and their number is so small they are not worth talking about , ” said seyran ates , a women ’ s rights activist and lawyer in berlin . " what we 're talking about is fundamentalism " the 40-year-old , who wrote a book about leaving her traditional turkish home in berlin , says she is astounded at the legitimacy with which some german politicians give the headscarf .
“ we need to never forget that what we ’ re talking about here is fundamentalism , ” she said . instead of deciding what place a piece of cloth that represents religious freedom to some , fundamentalism to others has in a state-run school , germany ’ s constitutional court referred the question to the state parliaments and the public domain - where many believe it belongs . “ we ’ re -lrb- as a society -rrb- not ready for such a decision , ” says riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .
referring to germany ’ s integration problems , spielhaus said “ we need an atmosphere of openness where we can accept that other religions might also change our values . “ how a headscarf ban produces terrorists the direction the debate is going worries both muslims and germans .

11 hijackers . others dismiss such ideas as scare tactics . “ there ’ s not a fundamentalist under every head scarf , and thinking that would be fatal , ” said spielhaus .
“ mrs. ludin ’ s head scarf , which she willingly puts on , is good for the western society .
banning head scarves would be a victory for fundamentalists . ” oztürk makes a similar argument , adding that her head scarf could even help dismantle prejudices before they arise in her young students . “ i think it ’ s very sad that this society continues to look at the head scarf as something of a threat , ” said oztürk .
“ i find it shocking that so many things are projected onto the headscarf without anyone ever asking the women who wear them . ” andreas tzortzis back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : will beards be banned soon too ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .

“ this is not an islamic country , it ’ s a christian country , and we should not be forced to accommodate islam . ” the headscarf also remains a sore spot because many consider it a symbol of fundamentalism and female discrimination in a western society . “ there are very few women who wear the head scarf voluntarily , and their number is so small they are not worth talking about , ” said seyran ates , a women ’ s rights activist and lawyer in berlin . " what we 're talking about is fundamentalism " the 40-year-old , who wrote a book about leaving her traditional turkish home in berlin , says she is astounded at the legitimacy with which some german politicians give the headscarf .
“ we need to never forget that what we ’ re talking about here is fundamentalism , ” she said . instead of deciding what place a piece of cloth that represents religious freedom to some , fundamentalism to others has in a state-run school , germany ’ s constitutional court referred the question to the state parliaments and the public domain - where many believe it belongs . “ we ’ re -lrb- as a society -rrb- not ready for such a decision , ” says riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .
referring to germany ’ s integration problems , spielhaus said “ we need an atmosphere of openness where we can accept that other religions might also change our values . “ how a headscarf ban produces terrorists the direction the debate is going worries both muslims and germans .

11 hijackers . others dismiss such ideas as scare tactics . “ there ’ s not a fundamentalist under every head scarf , and thinking that would be fatal , ” said spielhaus .
“ mrs. ludin ’ s head scarf , which she willingly puts on , is good for the western society .
banning head scarves would be a victory for fundamentalists . ” oztürk makes a similar argument , adding that her head scarf could even help dismantle prejudices before they arise in her young students . “ i think it ’ s very sad that this society continues to look at the head scarf as something of a threat , ” said oztürk .

" i personally feel that i have been cheated by the government of the republic of cyprus , " he told meps in strasbourg .
verheugen said that the decision in 1999 not to make a solution to the cyprus conflict a prerequisite for cypriot accession to the eu , was " on the understanding that the government of cyprus would do everything in its power to resolve the problem . "
whilst the greek cypriot part will join the eu whatever the result , the turkish cypriot part will remain out in the cold if one of the sides rejects the plan .
" tassos papadopoulos surprised everybody by pursuing a rejection of the un plan , " verheugen said .
the turkish and greek cypriot sides will go to the polls this saturday to vote on whether to accept the un blueprint for the island 's reunification before it joins the eu on may 1 .
verheugen made a last appeal to the cypriots to accept the plan as polls suggest that while a ' yes ' is expected in the turkish cypriot part , the greek cypriots are expected to reject the plan by a large margin .
" never before have we been as close to a solution as now , " he said .
" we are just inches away from our objective .
but i have to say i have little hope left for our being able to push forward those remaining few inches . "

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .
if he loses this battle , the power of the tabloid press could soon see him swept out of office - that is , if he has n't already lost any hope of winning another election . klaus dahmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .
if he loses this battle , the power of the tabloid press could soon see him swept out of office - that is , if he has n't already lost any hope of winning another election . klaus dahmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .

he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .
if he loses this battle , the power of the tabloid press could soon see him swept out of office - that is , if he has n't already lost any hope of winning another election . klaus dahmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .

he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.04.2004 juggling research and diplomacy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists clean a mosaic floor in turkey .
as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.04.2004 croatia inches closer to eu membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already a favorite destination for europeans : the croatian seaside .
the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel had proposed weber for the post tuesday night .
government sources have said that weber has already accepted the nomination . procedure requires the german president to name the central bank chief , who the bundesbank board of directors may not reject .

the names of foreign ministry state secretaries alfred tacke and caio koch-weser and bundesbank deputy chief jürgen stark had all been bandied about by the media as possible candidates . the bundesbank refused to comment on rumors wednesday that jürgen stark , who is considered close to the opposition christian democratic union party , might resign from his position if he did n't become bank president . broad approval weber , who is neither a member of a political party nor aligned with one , has already received backing from across party lines and from throughout the economic community .
opposition politician friedrich merz , the cdu 's spokesman for economics issues , welcomed weber 's selection .
the heads of two of germany 's top economic institutes , hanns-werner sinn of the ifo and klaus zimmermann of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , both praised the choice , as did michael heise , chief economist at insurance giant allianz , according to media reports . " he is a proven monetary policy-maker and will surely do the job well , " sinn said . weber received a doctorate in political science from the university of siegen in 1987 .
he started his academic career as a research associate in monetary and currency issues in 1982 in the western german city .
he later established himself as an expert on monetary theory and currency policies . he also made a name for himself by organizing international conferences and working as an advisor and consultant .
he has compiled studies on monetary policy and currency stability for european union institutions , including the european commission and the european parliament .
since 2001 he has been a part of the european central bank 's research department . if his selection is approved , weber , who is married and has two children , will be the youngest bundesbank president ever . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesbank president resigns the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .

for many , the government 's choice of the cologne economist came as a surprise . government officials officially nominated the 47-year-old university of cologne professor after a cabinet meeting on wednesday morning .
german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel had proposed weber for the post tuesday night .
government sources have said that weber has already accepted the nomination . procedure requires the german president to name the central bank chief , who the bundesbank board of directors may not reject .
but the bank leaders may demand a hearing to determine whether weber is qualified for the job .
their evaluation of the economist would then be relayed confidentially to the government . " professor weber is well-known to the bundesbank , " a spokesman for the directors said on wednesday .
he is a member of the bundesbank research center 's advisory board and had been involved significantly in various conferences , the spokesman said , according to reuters .
a " wise man " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weber -lrb- second from right -rrb- is one of germany 's five economic " wise men " indeed , weber , who is said to be eichel 's preferred candidate , may have been a surprise , but he 's far from unknown in economic circles .
for two years now he has been one of germany 's five so-called " wise men , " -lrb- photo -rrb- an independent academic body which advises the government and parliament on economic policy issues . initially , weber was n't on the long list of possible successors for ernst welteke , who resigned his post friday after revelations that he had allowed dresdner bank to pick up a hotel tab for him and his family to stay at berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel .
the names of foreign ministry state secretaries alfred tacke and caio koch-weser and bundesbank deputy chief jürgen stark had all been bandied about by the media as possible candidates . the bundesbank refused to comment on rumors wednesday that jürgen stark , who is considered close to the opposition christian democratic union party , might resign from his position if he did n't become bank president . broad approval weber , who is neither a member of a political party nor aligned with one , has already received backing from across party lines and from throughout the economic community .
opposition politician friedrich merz , the cdu 's spokesman for economics issues , welcomed weber 's selection .
the heads of two of germany 's top economic institutes , hanns-werner sinn of the ifo and klaus zimmermann of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , both praised the choice , as did michael heise , chief economist at insurance giant allianz , according to media reports . " he is a proven monetary policy-maker and will surely do the job well , " sinn said . weber received a doctorate in political science from the university of siegen in 1987 .
he started his academic career as a research associate in monetary and currency issues in 1982 in the western german city .
he later established himself as an expert on monetary theory and currency policies . he also made a name for himself by organizing international conferences and working as an advisor and consultant .
he has compiled studies on monetary policy and currency stability for european union institutions , including the european commission and the european parliament .
since 2001 he has been a part of the european central bank 's research department . if his selection is approved , weber , who is married and has two children , will be the youngest bundesbank president ever . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesbank president resigns the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw .

" i personally feel that i have been cheated by the government of the republic of cyprus , " he told meps in strasbourg .
verheugen said that the decision in 1999 not to make a solution to the cyprus conflict a prerequisite for cypriot accession to the eu , was " on the understanding that the government of cyprus would do everything in its power to resolve the problem . "
whilst the greek cypriot part will join the eu whatever the result , the turkish cypriot part will remain out in the cold if one of the sides rejects the plan .
" tassos papadopoulos surprised everybody by pursuing a rejection of the un plan , " verheugen said .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english 9799 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly .

patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .

britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

verheugen made a last appeal to the cypriots to accept the plan as polls suggest that while a ' yes ' is expected in the turkish cypriot part , the greek cypriots are expected to reject the plan by a large margin .
" never before have we been as close to a solution as now , " he said .

verheugen made a last appeal to the cypriots to accept the plan as polls suggest that while a ' yes ' is expected in the turkish cypriot part , the greek cypriots are expected to reject the plan by a large margin .
" never before have we been as close to a solution as now , " he said .
" we are just inches away from our objective .
but i have to say i have little hope left for our being able to push forward those remaining few inches . "

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .

in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .

teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .

as their numbers grow , so does their desire to assert their presence .
for the most part , germany 's politicians have treated islam 's growing influence with gloved hands .
but the sept .
11 terrorist attacks and their roots in a small mosque in hamburg threw the community into sharper focus .
muslims responded by becoming more vocal and demonstrative in asserting their religious rights , sparking already simmering debates on the place the headscarf holds in german society and whether muslim parents have the right to bend school rules .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .

in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .

back to first page back 2/2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang bosbach “ the debate is absurd , ” says the domestic affairs expert for the conservative christian democrats in the german parliament -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ this is not an islamic country , it ’ s a christian country , and we should not be forced to accommodate islam . ” the headscarf also remains a sore spot because many consider it a symbol of fundamentalism and female discrimination in a western society . “ there are very few women who wear the head scarf voluntarily , and their number is so small they are not worth talking about , ” said seyran ates , a women ’ s rights activist and lawyer in berlin . " what we 're talking about is fundamentalism " the 40-year-old , who wrote a book about leaving her traditional turkish home in berlin , says she is astounded at the legitimacy with which some german politicians give the headscarf .
“ we need to never forget that what we ’ re talking about here is fundamentalism , ” she said . instead of deciding what place a piece of cloth that represents religious freedom to some , fundamentalism to others has in a state-run school , germany ’ s constitutional court referred the question to the state parliaments and the public domain - where many believe it belongs . “ we ’ re -lrb- as a society -rrb- not ready for such a decision , ” says riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .

“ this is not an islamic country , it ’ s a christian country , and we should not be forced to accommodate islam . ” the headscarf also remains a sore spot because many consider it a symbol of fundamentalism and female discrimination in a western society . “ there are very few women who wear the head scarf voluntarily , and their number is so small they are not worth talking about , ” said seyran ates , a women ’ s rights activist and lawyer in berlin . " what we 're talking about is fundamentalism " the 40-year-old , who wrote a book about leaving her traditional turkish home in berlin , says she is astounded at the legitimacy with which some german politicians give the headscarf .
“ we need to never forget that what we ’ re talking about here is fundamentalism , ” she said . instead of deciding what place a piece of cloth that represents religious freedom to some , fundamentalism to others has in a state-run school , germany ’ s constitutional court referred the question to the state parliaments and the public domain - where many believe it belongs . “ we ’ re -lrb- as a society -rrb- not ready for such a decision , ” says riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .
referring to germany ’ s integration problems , spielhaus said “ we need an atmosphere of openness where we can accept that other religions might also change our values . “ how a headscarf ban produces terrorists the direction the debate is going worries both muslims and germans .

“ mrs. ludin ’ s head scarf , which she willingly puts on , is good for the western society .
banning head scarves would be a victory for fundamentalists . ” oztürk makes a similar argument , adding that her head scarf could even help dismantle prejudices before they arise in her young students . “ i think it ’ s very sad that this society continues to look at the head scarf as something of a threat , ” said oztürk .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

as the german archaeological institute turns 175 on wednesday , the spotlight will be on its archaeological work as well as on its cultural diplomacy in the arab world and the mid east . from prussian times to present-day democratic germany , the german archaeological institute -lrb- dai -rrb- has weathered a variety of political and ideological systems in its pursuit of scientific research .
founded on april 21 , 1829 in rome with the aim of researching and publicizing the archaeological discoveries of the antique greek era , the institute has seen an expansion of its focuses and activities over time .
today the dai represents a mammoth global archaeological network with eight departments , three commissions , a 100 scientists , 250 employees and worldwide excavations that have its archaeologists crisscrossing most continents .
the dai , whose headquarters were moved to berlin in 1833 , is located in the leafy upscale dahlem suburb of the german capital in a handful of sprawling neoclassical villas .
giving a tour of the wood-paneled interiors , astrid dostert , a classical archaeologist at the dai , underlined the institute ’ s increasing involvement in the arab world and the mid east .
" though we ’ ve been active in the region for quite some time now , the politico-cultural aspect of it has indeed taken on more significance in the past few years , " she admitted .
intensifying dialogue with the muslim world part of it has to do with the fact that the dai is financed by germany ’ s foreign ministry , which in recent years , particularly after the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the u.s. , has redoubled efforts to initiate dialogue with the muslim world through its network of institutions abroad .
the dai ’ s archaeological excavations in arab countries and the mid east which are committed to preserving the regions ' cultural heritage and identity lend themselves naturally to dialogue and exchange said margarete van ess , the scientific director of the dai ’ s near east section .
responding to an email interview from lebanon , van ess said , " archaeology contributes enormously to understanding between different cultures and this is particularly the case in arab countries , which are so rich in archaeological and historical treasures . "
archaeology more effective than diplomacy ?
van ess pointed out that archaeology often went far beyond diplomacy in winning hearts and minds .
" archaeologists usually pursue long-term projects , so they come regularly , stay for long and known the region well , " she said .
" it 's thus easier for them to win the trust of the local populace as well as the administration and politicians they come into contact with at the excavation sites .
they can even act as interlocutors between the various social classes in the country . "
digging around the muslim world in recent years , the dai has conducted excavations across the muslim world in cooperation with local archaeologists and researchers .
these include the excavation of the moghul park bagh-e-babur in kabul , archaeological investigations into the ancient town of marib in northeastern yemen , and excavations in tayma in saudi arabia , to name just a few .
the unesco , the cultural arm of the u.n. , also used dai 's expertise in its mission to assess the archaeological damage in postwar iraq .
in addition , the dai signed a ten-year project with the authorities of the antique department in iran last year , thus becoming one of the first institutions to be let into post-revolution iran for archaeological research .
dwindling funds limiting dai 's work bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the institute 's headquarters in berlin but despite its achievements , the dai ’ s 175th anniversary won ’ t just be an occasion for celebration .
budgetary cutbacks have cast a shadow over the institute .
" we have to put with up the cuts that the foreign ministry too has been facing in its budget , " said dostert .
" jobs have been slashed and we ’ re considering which foreign projects are viable in the long run .
funds for most of the excavations abroad have already been reduced , " she added .
dai ’ s budget for the current year is eur 21.3 million , almost the same as last year , but it still amounts to a reduction by almost 15 percent when compared to previous years according to dostert .
archaeologists concerned about iraq the unfolding political situation in iraq also has dai archaeologists worried .
the institute ’ s branch office in baghdad has been vacated in the face of growing violence .
van ess said that dozens of large , historically significant towns are being systematically destroyed in the search for valuable artifacts that can be sold on the illegal art market .
" if quick action isn ’ t taken to stop it , in a few months all that was known as ' old mesopotamia ' will be completely destroyed , " van ess warned . sonia phalnikar , © qantara.de 2004 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links qantara.de the internet portal promoting dialogue with the islamic world -lrb- english -rrb- german archaelogical institute information about the organization in english 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

german chancellor gerhard schröder and finance minister hans eichel had proposed weber for the post tuesday night .
government sources have said that weber has already accepted the nomination . procedure requires the german president to name the central bank chief , who the bundesbank board of directors may not reject .

for two years now he has been one of germany 's five so-called " wise men , " -lrb- photo -rrb- an independent academic body which advises the government and parliament on economic policy issues . initially , weber was n't on the long list of possible successors for ernst welteke , who resigned his post friday after revelations that he had allowed dresdner bank to pick up a hotel tab for him and his family to stay at berlin 's luxurious adlon hotel .
the names of foreign ministry state secretaries alfred tacke and caio koch-weser and bundesbank deputy chief jürgen stark had all been bandied about by the media as possible candidates . the bundesbank refused to comment on rumors wednesday that jürgen stark , who is considered close to the opposition christian democratic union party , might resign from his position if he did n't become bank president . broad approval weber , who is neither a member of a political party nor aligned with one , has already received backing from across party lines and from throughout the economic community .
opposition politician friedrich merz , the cdu 's spokesman for economics issues , welcomed weber 's selection .
the heads of two of germany 's top economic institutes , hanns-werner sinn of the ifo and klaus zimmermann of the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- , both praised the choice , as did michael heise , chief economist at insurance giant allianz , according to media reports . " he is a proven monetary policy-maker and will surely do the job well , " sinn said . weber received a doctorate in political science from the university of siegen in 1987 .
he started his academic career as a research associate in monetary and currency issues in 1982 in the western german city .
he later established himself as an expert on monetary theory and currency policies . he also made a name for himself by organizing international conferences and working as an advisor and consultant .
he has compiled studies on monetary policy and currency stability for european union institutions , including the european commission and the european parliament .
since 2001 he has been a part of the european central bank 's research department . if his selection is approved , weber , who is married and has two children , will be the youngest bundesbank president ever . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesbank president resigns the head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , resigned friday after further revelations he accepted freebies from bmw .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?
a sort of provocation under the motto : tony , it 's your own fault is you want to suddenly start playing the game called " grassroots democracy . " even if the european constitution ca n't be broken by a no vote from britain , for blair it 's still a matter of do or die .
if he loses this battle , the power of the tabloid press could soon see him swept out of office - that is , if he has n't already lost any hope of winning another election . klaus dahmann -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair confirms brits to vote on eu constitution in a major reversal of policy , british prime minister tony blair said tuesday he will call a british referendum on the eu constitution following months of pressure from the euroskeptic opposition conservatives .

or is it only courage born out of despair ? blair is currently battling a stiff wind from a population that feels it was deceived and betrayed by his justification for going to war in iraq .
the prime minister just about managed to wriggle out of the kelly affair .
but no one really believes that he told the truth about iraq 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . now , a somewhat weakened tony blair has announced that he intends to let a euroskeptic british majority have the final say on the rather delicate issue that is the eu constitution - this , from the same man who has repeatedly been the scourge of the british tabloid press for being far too keen to cosy up to brussels . irish example a cursory glance in the direction of neighboring ireland - where the population is much more eu-friendly than in britain - should be enough to warn blair about the dangers ahead .
in ireland , the first referendum on the nice treaty in 2001 failed miserably .
only when the referendum was repeated a year later did the irish vote yes .
but to get that result , the government had to exert itself in order to convey the sense and purpose of the treaty to the people .
that 's no small task , considering that a document that 's been negotiated by diplomats and written by lawyers hardly lends itself to a simple explanation .
in the end , the majority of irish voters put their trust in what their politicians told them .
they did n't sit down and study the nice treaty to come to an independent conclusion of whether it was good or bad . but it 's exactly at this juncture where blair could have serious difficulties .
through the iraq war , he 's largely lost the public 's trust .
add to this the power of the british tabloid press , which seems to take glee in demonizing the eu through its imaginative horror stories .
one also should n't forget that the very word " constitution " is something that will take getting used to in britain , as the country has managed quite nicely up until now without one .
it 's no wonder that the opinion polls taken so far bode ill : they indicate that more than half of britons would vote against the eu constitution in the referendum . doing battle with euroskeptics still , none of this seems to faze blair .
he sees the situation as a challenge : let the battle with the euroskeptics begin !
but who at the moment trusts blair to emerge from the battlefield victorious ? in brussels and strasbourg , the alarm bells are already ringing .
if the british reject the eu constitution , it does n't mean that the whole project lands in the bin .
the document 's authors , anticipating such difficulties , have incorporated legal loopholes , with which the constitution can be saved . but a no vote from britain would mean a significant delay and further negotiations , and then a second referendum , and possibly even a third and a fourth , until the constitution is secured . or , there 's the worst case scenario : the constitution would come into effect for all the eu states , except britain . some german representatives in the european parliament are already pressing ahead with creative suggestions : why not simply write a clause into the constitution 's text that says any state that rejects it will automatically be kicked out of the eu ?

about 9,300 women currently serve in the military , which has a total of about 271,000 troops .
the old regulation has put a strain on couples , especially while on duty abroad , as soldiers are not allowed to leave military bases .
according to the proposed new rules , officers will have to make sure that couples are given adequate space and privacy .
it 's still unclear whether the change will only apply to married couples or others in long-term relationships as well , a defense ministry spokesman told dw-world .
gay and lesbian couples could also benefit from the new rules as they can officially register their partnerships with the state in germany . more briefs 21.04.2004 -pipe- mother tries to auction daughter on ebay 21.04.2004 -pipe- possible new start for nazi documentation center 21.04.2004 -pipe- rau visits holocaust memorial in budapest 21.04.2004 -pipe- two germans die in fighter jet collision 20.04.2004 -pipe- germans spend less than one hour a day reading 20.04.2004 -pipe- german film prize nominations announced 20.04.2004 -pipe- nazi war crimes trial opens in italy 20.04.2004 -pipe- fischer rallies the troops in afghanistan 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

“ this is not an islamic country , it ’ s a christian country , and we should not be forced to accommodate islam . ” the headscarf also remains a sore spot because many consider it a symbol of fundamentalism and female discrimination in a western society . “ there are very few women who wear the head scarf voluntarily , and their number is so small they are not worth talking about , ” said seyran ates , a women ’ s rights activist and lawyer in berlin . " what we 're talking about is fundamentalism " the 40-year-old , who wrote a book about leaving her traditional turkish home in berlin , says she is astounded at the legitimacy with which some german politicians give the headscarf .
“ we need to never forget that what we ’ re talking about here is fundamentalism , ” she said . instead of deciding what place a piece of cloth that represents religious freedom to some , fundamentalism to others has in a state-run school , germany ’ s constitutional court referred the question to the state parliaments and the public domain - where many believe it belongs . “ we ’ re -lrb- as a society -rrb- not ready for such a decision , ” says riem spielhaus , an islamic studies lecturer at berlin ’ s humboldt university .
referring to germany ’ s integration problems , spielhaus said “ we need an atmosphere of openness where we can accept that other religions might also change our values . “ how a headscarf ban produces terrorists the direction the debate is going worries both muslims and germans .

11 hijackers . others dismiss such ideas as scare tactics . “ there ’ s not a fundamentalist under every head scarf , and thinking that would be fatal , ” said spielhaus .
“ mrs. ludin ’ s head scarf , which she willingly puts on , is good for the western society .
banning head scarves would be a victory for fundamentalists . ” oztürk makes a similar argument , adding that her head scarf could even help dismantle prejudices before they arise in her young students . “ i think it ’ s very sad that this society continues to look at the head scarf as something of a threat , ” said oztürk .

11 terrorist attacks in the united states and the madrid bombings on march 11 have revealed a muslim community not without its fundamentalist element .

the european commission has pledged to back croatia 's application to join the union .
although a start date for accession talks wo n't be confirmed until june , the former yugoslav republic is already en-route to home base . in an address to the european parliament in strasbourg , european external relations commissioner chris patten and enlargement commissioner günter verheugen announced the commission 's support for zagreb 's application , adding they would suggest to the council of ministers that they start membership talks " quickly . "
patten described it as an " historic day for croatia , " which is the second balkan country after slovenia to have come so far in a bid to become a part of the growing european union .
he said croatia had made a lot of progress but stressed that there was still work to be done .
directly addressing croatian foreign minister miomir zuzul , who was present at the debate in strasbourg , patten said zagreb needed to reform its judicial system , do more to protect its minorities and make it possible for serb refugees to return to their homes . verheugen praised croatia 's growing economy , which is a key factor for potential accession to the eu .
" croatia is better placed today than most of the countries that will be joining on may 1st , " verheugen said in reference to the impending expansion of the union from 15 to 25 members .
" the economy is strong , very strong , and in close cooperation with the economy of the eu , " he added .
the expansion commissioner said he believed eu support for croatia 's increasing efforts to meet membership entry requirements would send an " important and powerful signal " to the entire region .
he cited the former yugoslav republic as an example to it neighbors that effort pays off . clean bill of health croatia first applied to join the eu roundtable in february 2003 , but the application stuck on the issue of how much zagreb was doing to cooperate with the international war crimes tribunal in the hague .
banging the drum of concern were principally the netherlands and britain , who wanted to see zagreb do more to track down war crimes suspects before endorsing its application .
britain , in particular , wanted croatia to hand over general ante gotovina , who has been wanted in the hague since 2001 for alleged war crimes against serbs in 1995 .
although the fugitive gotovina has still not been captured , croatian prime minister ivo sanader has overseen the handover of eight suspects to the tribunal since his election in november .
they include two indicted generals and six former bosnian croat officials .
and this seems to have been enough to pacify britain , which has now dropped its blocking tactic .
" the british government hopes to see croatia as a member of the eu before the decade is out , " denis macshane , britain 's minister for europe told the guardian newspaper .
he added that " gotovina no longer remains an obstacle to saying croatia can start accession talks . "
speaking in strasbourg yesterday , chris patten said un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte had given croatia a clean bill of health for its cooperation with the tribunal .
" she concluded that croatia is fully complying with the tribunal , and sees no likelihood of that situation changing .
as far as the gotovina case is concerned , she indicated that the croatian government is doing all it can to help locate and turn him over to the hague , " patten told reuters .
new chapter in balkan history it 's a breakthrough for the croatian prime minister , who is hoping to lead his country into the eu in 2007 along with romania and bulgaria .
" we 're opening today a new page in our history , and i 'm sure the whole nation is sharing in the happiness of taking this first concrete step towards eu membership , " sander said in the croatian capital .
in accession he sees a chance not only for his people , but also for the entire region .
" croatia has the chance to become a success story , to pave the way for our neighbors in southeast europe to follow , " sanader said .
" a unified europe would n't stand a chance if new dividing lines were introduced , and some countries were excluded from unification .

there is not one major german city where the spires of a mosque ca n't be seen reaching out among the housetops .
headscarves on the street have become as familiar as the sausage stand on the corner .
as their numbers grow , so does their desire to assert their presence .
for the most part , germany 's politicians have treated islam 's growing influence with gloved hands .
but the sept .
11 terrorist attacks and their roots in a small mosque in hamburg threw the community into sharper focus .
muslims responded by becoming more vocal and demonstrative in asserting their religious rights , sparking already simmering debates on the place the headscarf holds in german society and whether muslim parents have the right to bend school rules .

of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class . having spent the last 15 years of her life wearing the muslim hijab , emine oztürk , who is studying to become a teacher , can ’ t imagine taking it off in public , even for just one minute .
but that ’ s exactly what oztürk might have to do if she ever wants to get a job in a berlin public school . “ it ’ s part of my identity , ” said the 25-year-old german of turkish descent .
“ how can i lay my identity at the door of the classroom ? ” it is a question on the minds of many here following a decision last fall by germany ’ s highest court allowing teacher fereshta ludin to wear her head scarf in class as long as there were no state laws against it .
though the court upheld ludin 's right to wear the hijab , it also opened the door for states to pass laws banning teachers from donning it in the classroom .
since the decision , the southern german state of baden-württemberg , where ludin first brought her case , has passed just such a law . the state government in berlin has proposed a law banning all religious symbols , including the jewish kippa and christian crucifix , from jobs in the public sector .
a majority of germany ’ s 16 states are expected to pass similar laws . banned in france , encouraged in england in the debate taking place across germany , politicians and muslim leaders have begun to ask some very serious questions about the place their religion and identity holds in a europe rooted in christianity and judaism , but with a growing and powerful muslim population . “ you have a new generation of muslims … reasonably educated , fluent in the cultures and languages they live in … demanding a sort of legitimization .
they want it without having to become assimilated , ” said shireen hunter , the head of the islam program at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , d.c. , and editor of “ islam , europe ’ s second religion . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands worldwide protested against the french headscarf ban .
in march , the french parliament approved legislation that banned head scarves and other religious symbols from state schools beginning in september .
in great britain and sweden , a more open attitude prevails .
teachers and even female muslim police officers are allowed to wear their head scarves . germany ’ s relationship to its 3.2 million muslims is decidedly more fragile . touchy issues of integration such as muslim dress and the ritual slaughter of sheep in accordance with islamic law have been brought before courts in recent years . earlier this summer , the constitutional court ruled that a department store could not fire a muslim woman because she wanted to wear her head scarf during work . a cloth menace ? the legal conflicts are symptoms of the neglect of both the german government and the turkish community in addressing the issue of integration , say historians .
by the time integration became a topic , the sons and grandsons of the turkish guest workers that arrived in the 1960s had already carved out little ankaras and istanbuls in germany ’ s major cities .
the hijab has long been part of the german streetscape . “ we live in a free , modern society , where everyone has their own self-awareness , ” says ali kizilkaya , head of the powerful and controversial islam council , germany ’ s largest muslim group .
“ are we so weak that a square foot of cloth can make us feel threatened ? ” opponents argue that it is not the head scarf , but the fact that bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state schools in bavaria have to remove crucifixes if just one student objects .
ludin wants to wear it in the public school classroom in a country with a strong secular tradition . eight years ago , the constitutional court ruled that crucifixes would have to be removed from classrooms in bavaria if just one student objected . the fact that muslims want what many see as more freedom to express their religion than german christians makes parliamentarian wolfgang bosbach angry . next page : accommodate islam ?

the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .

the soyuz spacecraft docked with the iss on wednesday , after a two-day flight from kazakhstan .
the crew are american michael fincke , russian gennady padalka and andre kuipers of the netherlands .
it is the third manned mission to the iss since us shuttle flights were halted in the wake of the columbia disaster on 1 february 2003 .
since then , russian rockets have provided the only means for crews to travel to the space station .
financial wrangling the soyuz tma-4 , working on autopilot , docked just ahead of schedule at 0501 gmt .
" we have contact , " the duty operator at the mission control centre at korolyov , outside moscow , said .
the audience at the centre then burst into applause .
fred gregory , deputy administrator of the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- said : " i would like to thank the russian space agency for again providing an excellent launch , an excellent ride and an excellent docking as we continue this great friendship and journey together .
we appreciate everything that has been done . "
the americans have turned down a request from the russians to extend the length of tours to the iss .
the russians would like astronauts and cosmonauts to spend a year aboard the orbital platform rather than the six months they currently serve .
moscow says this would save considerable sums of money and free up seats on soyuz capsules for fare-paying tourists - an important source of revenue .
the head of the company that builds russia 's soyuz and progress spacecraft said longer flights had to come .
" our position is rigid : the next crew must make a long flight .
i would urge the american colleagues not to drag their feet on solving this issue , " said yuri semyonov , director of the energiya company .
" we are ready for long flights .
our equipment is ready for that .
our partners must listen to their russian colleagues . "
next march while the us recognises the need to extend spaceflights to learn how astronauts could survive long journeys , such as to mars , it believes it would be premature to extend iss tours right now .
" we would like to delay any further discussions on this until -lsb- the space shuttles -rsb- return to flight , which would be scheduled for next march , when we can assure that all the operating systems , life support systems , are operating , " gregory said .
" we are also discussing the biological activities that need to be accomplished for us to do the longer mission . "
the new crew , called expedition 9 , will have a week of handover activities with the current expedition 8 crew .
the latter , made up of us astronaut michael foale and russian cosmonaut alexander kaleri , will then return to earth with mr kuipers .

the soyuz spacecraft docked with the iss on wednesday , after a two-day flight from kazakhstan .
the crew are american michael fincke , russian gennady padalka and andre kuipers of the netherlands .
it is the third manned mission to the iss since us shuttle flights were halted in the wake of the columbia disaster on 1 february 2003 .
since then , russian rockets have provided the only means for crews to travel to the space station .
financial wrangling the soyuz tma-4 , working on autopilot , docked just ahead of schedule at 0501 gmt .
" we have contact , " the duty operator at the mission control centre at korolyov , outside moscow , said .
the audience at the centre then burst into applause .
fred gregory , deputy administrator of the us space agency -lrb- nasa -rrb- said : " i would like to thank the russian space agency for again providing an excellent launch , an excellent ride and an excellent docking as we continue this great friendship and journey together .
we appreciate everything that has been done . "
the americans have turned down a request from the russians to extend the length of tours to the iss .
the russians would like astronauts and cosmonauts to spend a year aboard the orbital platform rather than the six months they currently serve .
moscow says this would save considerable sums of money and free up seats on soyuz capsules for fare-paying tourists - an important source of revenue .
the head of the company that builds russia 's soyuz and progress spacecraft said longer flights had to come .
" our position is rigid : the next crew must make a long flight .
i would urge the american colleagues not to drag their feet on solving this issue , " said yuri semyonov , director of the energiya company .
" we are ready for long flights .
our equipment is ready for that .
our partners must listen to their russian colleagues . "
next march while the us recognises the need to extend spaceflights to learn how astronauts could survive long journeys , such as to mars , it believes it would be premature to extend iss tours right now .
" we would like to delay any further discussions on this until -lsb- the space shuttles -rsb- return to flight , which would be scheduled for next march , when we can assure that all the operating systems , life support systems , are operating , " gregory said .
" we are also discussing the biological activities that need to be accomplished for us to do the longer mission . "
the new crew , called expedition 9 , will have a week of handover activities with the current expedition 8 crew .
the latter , made up of us astronaut michael foale and russian cosmonaut alexander kaleri , will then return to earth with mr kuipers .

the british chambers of commerce -lrb- bcc -rrb- study also found that nearly half of the 2,800 firms questioned did not report each and every crime .
the most common offences firms faced were burglary and damage to vehicles .
a separate report by the federation of small businesses also found many small firms have been victims of crime .
of 18,600 small firms questioned by the fsb , six out of 10 said that they had been targeted by criminals during the past year , and one in four said their premises had been attacked or their vehicles damaged .
costly disruption bcc president isabella moore said she is urging the government to record separate statistics detailing crimes against businesses .
" there is a widespread perception amongst our members that crime against business is not taken seriously by the government , " she said .
" police performance in relation to crime against business is not measured and so the police are often unwilling to divert resources towards tackling the problem . "
home secretary david blunkett said the government recognised the cost and disruption that crime causes to business - as well as the knock-on effects for communities and consumers .
" this is why the government has provided nearly £ 1m to the action against business crime group which will help set up 100 local business crime partnerships , " mr blunkett said .
low confidence " we have already helped 12,500 small shops in deprived areas to install crime prevention measures and business crime advisers in the regional offices are working with the home office business crime team to co-ordinate work at a local level , " he added .
the fsb said a third of those it polled believed that reporting a crime would be useless and a quarter lacked confidence in the police catching the criminals .
shadow industry secretary stephen o 'brien said : " many small businesses clearly have no confidence in the criminal justice system and are not reporting many crimes . "

professor ian wilmut , of the roslin institute in edinburgh , wants to use cloned human embryos to study motor neurone disease -lrb- mnd -rrb- .
his application to the human fertilisation and embryology authority is expected to provoke criticism that testing human embryos is immoral .
therapeutic cloning for research has been legal in the uk since 2001 .
it would be immoral not to take this opportunity to study diseases .
professor ian wilmut q & a : therapeutic cloning it is designed purely for research .
professor wilmut has stressed that his team has no intention of producing cloned babies , and said the embryos would be destroyed after experimentation .
he told the bbc : " because at this early stage the embryo does not have that key human characteristic of being aware to me it would be immoral not to take this opportunity to study diseases . "
until recently , professor wilmut had said he would not work with human embryos .
mnd is caused by the death of cells - called motor neurones - that control movement in the brain and spinal cord .
muscle weakness it affects about 5,000 people in the uk .
half of people with mnd die within 14 months of diagnosis .
professor wilmut has applied for a licence weakness in the muscles that supply the face and throat also cause problems with speech and difficulty chewing and swallowing .
the aim is to study what goes wrong in the nerve cells of patients suffering from mnd .
professor wilmut 's team plan to take dna from the skin or blood of a person with mnd and implant it into a human egg from which the genetic material has been removed .
the egg would then be stimulated to develop into an embryo .
the scientists would remove cells from the embryo while it was still in the earliest stages of development , and study them to gain a better understanding of the disease .
the embryo would be destroyed while still just a few days old .
if successful , professor wilmut said the technique could have profound implications for a range of other debilitating neurological and genetic disorders .
his team is the first to apply for a therapeutic cloning licence in the uk .
however , it is less than three months since scientists in south korea announced that they had created 30 cloned human embryos for research purposes .
difficult to study a human being is being deliberately created and then destroyed .
patrick cusworth dr robin lovell-badge , head of developmental genetics at the national institute for medical research , said mnd , along with many other diseases , was difficult to study in patients .
" by the time you get to them they are already sick , and it is unethical to do much then . "
he said professor wilmut would be testing embryos that were just a ball of a few hundred cells at a stage long before any development of a nervous system .
however , patrick cusworth , a spokesman for the charity life uk , voiced opposition to the research .
he said : " it comes as no surprise that professor wilmut has decided to extend cloning from animals to human beings .
" the fact that he does so under the banner of so-called therapeutic cloning makes no difference whatsoever to the fact that a human being is being deliberately created and then destroyed . "
mr cusworth said alternative techniques - such as taking samples from umbilical cord blood - were available to allow scientists a supply of cells for experimentation without having to go down this line .
fertility expert lord winston argued that all cells had the potential for human life .
" i do n't think that changes the argument that actually it is a moral duty to try to enhance , protect and promote healthy human life - which is exactly what this project is trying to do . "
george levvy , chief executive of the mnd association , said the research had the potential to " revolutionise the future treatment of mnd " .
he said : " the association recognises that the issues of embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning raise significant moral , ethical and religious concerns .

professor ian wilmut , of the roslin institute in edinburgh , wants to use cloned human embryos to study motor neurone disease -lrb- mnd -rrb- .
his application to the human fertilisation and embryology authority is expected to provoke criticism that testing human embryos is immoral .
therapeutic cloning for research has been legal in the uk since 2001 .
it would be immoral not to take this opportunity to study diseases .
professor ian wilmut q & a : therapeutic cloning it is designed purely for research .
professor wilmut has stressed that his team has no intention of producing cloned babies , and said the embryos would be destroyed after experimentation .
he told the bbc : " because at this early stage the embryo does not have that key human characteristic of being aware to me it would be immoral not to take this opportunity to study diseases . "
until recently , professor wilmut had said he would not work with human embryos .
mnd is caused by the death of cells - called motor neurones - that control movement in the brain and spinal cord .
muscle weakness it affects about 5,000 people in the uk .
half of people with mnd die within 14 months of diagnosis .
professor wilmut has applied for a licence weakness in the muscles that supply the face and throat also cause problems with speech and difficulty chewing and swallowing .
the aim is to study what goes wrong in the nerve cells of patients suffering from mnd .
professor wilmut 's team plan to take dna from the skin or blood of a person with mnd and implant it into a human egg from which the genetic material has been removed .
the egg would then be stimulated to develop into an embryo .
the scientists would remove cells from the embryo while it was still in the earliest stages of development , and study them to gain a better understanding of the disease .
the embryo would be destroyed while still just a few days old .
if successful , professor wilmut said the technique could have profound implications for a range of other debilitating neurological and genetic disorders .
his team is the first to apply for a therapeutic cloning licence in the uk .
however , it is less than three months since scientists in south korea announced that they had created 30 cloned human embryos for research purposes .
difficult to study a human being is being deliberately created and then destroyed .
patrick cusworth dr robin lovell-badge , head of developmental genetics at the national institute for medical research , said mnd , along with many other diseases , was difficult to study in patients .
" by the time you get to them they are already sick , and it is unethical to do much then . "
he said professor wilmut would be testing embryos that were just a ball of a few hundred cells at a stage long before any development of a nervous system .
however , patrick cusworth , a spokesman for the charity life uk , voiced opposition to the research .
he said : " it comes as no surprise that professor wilmut has decided to extend cloning from animals to human beings .
" the fact that he does so under the banner of so-called therapeutic cloning makes no difference whatsoever to the fact that a human being is being deliberately created and then destroyed . "
mr cusworth said alternative techniques - such as taking samples from umbilical cord blood - were available to allow scientists a supply of cells for experimentation without having to go down this line .
fertility expert lord winston argued that all cells had the potential for human life .
" i do n't think that changes the argument that actually it is a moral duty to try to enhance , protect and promote healthy human life - which is exactly what this project is trying to do . "
george levvy , chief executive of the mnd association , said the research had the potential to " revolutionise the future treatment of mnd " .
he said : " the association recognises that the issues of embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning raise significant moral , ethical and religious concerns .
" however , in principle we will support this research project , as long as we are satisfied that it is legal , has a sound scientific rationale and has the potential to bring us closer to treatments and / or a cure for mnd . "

egg reported a first quarter pre-tax loss of £ 4.9m , down from a £ 15.7m deficit in the same period last year .

egg , which has been put up for sale by its majority owner prudential , said sale talks were ongoing .
the prudential is seeking to sell its 79 % stake in egg , and said in january that several companies had expressed an interest .
potential bidders are rumoured to include royal bank of scotland , mbna , barclays and lloyds tsb .

six fire crews and an aerial platform were called to rhosnesni high school in wrexham , just before 0600 bst .
north wales fire service said the fire , which broke out in the hall , was being treated as a serious incident .
lessons will not be affected as no pupils are being taught at the site , which is undergoing building work .
worried neighbours alerted firefighters when the blaze broke out early on wednesday .
police and fire investigators have decided the construction workers can enter the school grounds and continue their work on one of wrexham 's new ' super ' schools .
north wales fire service said the blaze was well alight when they arrived but they managed to confine it all to the hall .
rhosnesni is one of three schools in wrexham which are being merged into two " super schools " .
pupils from rhosnesni , formerly known as st david 's , are being taught at the grove high school , which will shut once the reorganisation is complete .
the former st david 's , the grove and bryn offa school are closing and pupils will be taught at the rebuilt rhosnesni and ysgol clywedog -lrb- the old bryn offa -rrb- sites .
building work is being carried out at rhosnesni to adapt the site and it was due to open fully in july .
the project has already seen costs rise from £ 12m to £ 22m .
it is not yet clear whether the incident will delay the building work , but wrexham council 's education spokesman terry garner says they will try to get work completed by the summer .
" with the combined efforts of builders and the authority we hope it will stay on target , " he said .
" we owe a lot to the speedy response of the fire service , " he added .

capio healthcare and nuffield hospitals will carry out 25,000 extra operations over the next year .
they will concentrate on areas where the nhs is having trouble getting waiting lists down , such as hip and knee replacements .
the groups won the contracts after promising to carry out the operations for the same price as the nhs .
extra capacity private firm capio healthcare runs 21 private hospitals in england .
nuffield hospitals , a not for profit organisation , runs 43 hospitals in england and one in scotland .
both groups are expected to use spare capacity in these hospitals to carry out the operations . "
we are concerned about the consequences this will have on the nhs " spokeswoman , unison the government 's policy of using private and independent firms to treat nhs patients has come under fire in recent months .
critics were particularly concerned that ministers were paying over the odds for operations that could be provided more cheaply by the nhs .
figures published last october suggested that operations carried out by the private sector were as much as 40 % more expensive than those done on the nhs .
department of health officials say the fact that firms are now charging the same as the nhs shows its policy of using private firms has paid off .
the government has signed contracts with a number of private firms in recent months to carry out extra operations .
however , most of these have been from overseas as british firms proved more expensive .
officials say this latest deal shows that british healthcare groups are becoming more competitive .
' great news ' health secretary john reid hailed the deal .
" this is great news for thousands of nhs patients , who will have their operations more quickly as a result of this agreement , " he said .
" i am determined that no nhs patient should wait in pain where we can negotiate cost-effective agreements to use capacity already available in the independent sector in this country .
" this deal represents good value for the nhs because the cost for each operation and associated care is on a par with equivalent nhs prices . "
david mobbs , chief executive of nuffield hospitals , welcomed the deal .
" we are delighted that nuffield hospitals has been recognised by the department of health as providing high quality , value for money services and care to support the nhs . "
tim elsigood , senior vice president and head of the capio healthcare uk business area , said : " this is good news for nhs patients .
" we welcome this opportunity to help the nhs meet its waiting list targets as well as providing further choice for nhs patients . "
but the trade union unison , which represents many nhs workers , said it had some concerns .
" we welcome the fact that thousands of patients will benefit from having these operations , " said a spokeswoman .
" however , we are concerned about the consequences this will have on the nhs .
" we would like to see capacity in the nhs built up so that we do n't rely on the private sector because when that happens we see cherry picking of patients and higher patients . "

the volume of the call and what is being discussed play a part in making people see red , the team at the university of york found .
but in many cases it is simply the fact that we are only hearing half a conversation that drives people mad .
" conversations only work if there is a general agreement .
there is a need to understand what is said and to talk back , " explained professor andrew monk , director of the centre for usable home technology at the university .
" what other people are saying triggers language use and subconsciously you want to answer back , " he continued .

our research predicts that mobile phones with speaker phones might actually be less annoying professor andrew monk , university of york " i was surprised at just how annoying some people find mobile conversations , " he told bbc news online .
in the study , 64 members of the public were exposed to the same staged conversation , either while waiting for a bus or travelling on a train .
half of the conversations were on mobile phones and half were face-to-face conversations .
the conversation , about a proposed holiday and planning a surprise party for a friend , was conducted both at usually speaking level and exaggeratedly loud .
participants were asked to rate the annoyance value of the conversation they heard on scale of one to five , as well as how much they noticed it .
those conducted on a mobile phone in both categories were significantly more annoying and noticeable to the group than face to face ones .
louder phones the study also found that small variables such as seating arrangements could influence how annoying people find conversations .
the train passengers tended to be slightly more irritated .
" it could be because they were seated opposite to the caller rather than shoulder to shoulder , " said prof monk .
again this comes down to the natural way we sit when having a face-to-face conversation .
the findings could contain some interesting lessons for mobile phone manufacturers .
" our research predicts that mobile phones with speaker phones might actually be less annoying , " he said .
other features , such as making it easier to adjust the ringtone and volume , could help make for more considerate mobile phone usage he thinks .

the volume of the call and what is being discussed play a part in making people see red , the team at the university of york found .
but in many cases it is simply the fact that we are only hearing half a conversation that drives people mad .
" conversations only work if there is a general agreement .
there is a need to understand what is said and to talk back , " explained professor andrew monk , director of the centre for usable home technology at the university .
" what other people are saying triggers language use and subconsciously you want to answer back , " he continued .
very annoying prof monk was inspired to do the research after his own experiences with other people 's mobile conversations . "
our research predicts that mobile phones with speaker phones might actually be less annoying " professor andrew monk , university of york " i was surprised at just how annoying some people find mobile conversations , " he told bbc news online .
in the study , 64 members of the public were exposed to the same staged conversation , either while waiting for a bus or travelling on a train .
half of the conversations were on mobile phones and half were face-to-face conversations .
the conversation , about a proposed holiday and planning a surprise party for a friend , was conducted both at usually speaking level and exaggeratedly loud .
participants were asked to rate the annoyance value of the conversation they heard on scale of one to five , as well as how much they noticed it .
those conducted on a mobile phone in both categories were significantly more annoying and noticeable to the group than face to face ones .
louder phones the study also found that small variables such as seating arrangements could influence how annoying people find conversations .
the train passengers tended to be slightly more irritated .
" it could be because they were seated opposite to the caller rather than shoulder to shoulder , " said prof monk .
again this comes down to the natural way we sit when having a face-to-face conversation .
the findings could contain some interesting lessons for mobile phone manufacturers .
" our research predicts that mobile phones with speaker phones might actually be less annoying , " he said .
other features , such as making it easier to adjust the ringtone and volume , could help make for more considerate mobile phone usage he thinks .
personally speaking prof monk confesses he does not find mobile calls that annoying .
" i think it is rather nice that people are talking to each other , " he said .

people should avoid clicking on unknown attachments so says marcus ranum , a senior technologist at respected security firm trusecure and the man credited with creating the first commercial firewall .
mr ranum says there is a growing divide between the way that organisations and end users tackle computer security .
many corporations are taking effective steps to protect themselves against viruses , spam and attacks by criminal or malicious hackers using all the tools and services the hi-tech security industry can provide .
wrong route " although we are making huge inroads in security for corporations , " he says , " the end users do not get it . "
in particular says mr ranum , home users do not seem to worry about security at all .
" as long as it does not hurt them they do not care , " he says .
" doing the wrong thing is the path of least resistance . "
ranum : do not trust end users home users with broadband net connections who have their machine turned into a spam relay by a virus will only care if their browsing speed drops significantly or if they are cut off by their provider .
similarly , he says , renewing a stolen credit card is so easy that few people worry about it when it happens .
" human users can fairly safely survive by not doing anything , " he says , " so they are not going to change . "
" we are psychologically unsuited to be secure in the way that the computer industry says we should be . "
he says that any approach relying on an educated , interested and diligent population of end users that does not click on attachments , respond to spam and which regularly changes its hard-to-guess passwords , is not going to work .
net service firms and corporations should not assume that their users will help limit problems .
" do not trust your users to do anything right , " he says .
self-defence in mr ranum 's opinion , technology is going to have to change to work with us rather than force us to do the things we tend not to do .
firms need to know what is happening to their machines " technology is going to have to go towards systems that just work like the cell phone just works , " he says , " you do not have to patch your telephone . "
" we need to make systems that users do not have to be educated to use . "
instead of concentrating on features , software makers should start thinking about security when they build products rather than add it later , he says .
along with the creation of such systems go some common sense principles that firms using the net should apply to make it as hard as possible for users to do the wrong thing .
companies could begin by using e-mail programs that do not open and execute attachments as soon as they arrive .
they should also keep anti-virus software up to date and keep it running to stop the malicious programs as they are spotted .
computer systems that keep a business running that do not need to be connected to the net should not be , says mr ranum .
finally , he said firms need to start monitoring network traffic to get a better idea of what is normal traffic and spot when virus outbreaks start or if a firm 's computers have been hijacked by spammers .
" i think the paradigm is going to continue to be : if you are concerned about being defended you have to defend yourself , " he says .

the head of the church of england used his christmas sermon to warn that a secure world would only be possible if the rich shared their wealth , justice and liberty with poorer nations .
he accused some countries of concentrating on terrorism and failing to reach their own development goals .
he also stressed the importance of halving world poverty by 2015 - a goal which he said had not moved on for four years .
dr rowan williams urged christians to engage the world of politics after being enthroned as the 104th archbishop of canterbury in february 2003 .
" when christians grieve or protest about war , about debt and poverty , about prejudice , about the humiliations of unemployment ... it is because of the fear we rightly feel , " he said .

dr williams has made his views against the war in iraq clear .
he has praised the men and women serving in the gulf for their courage and dedication .
but said the aftermath of the iraq war has resulted in a loss of trust in the nation 's political system .
the archbishop has also courted controversy with his objection to anti-gay views in the church and his support for the ordination of women priests .
earlier this year , the archbishop called on anglican leaders to put their differences over the issue of gay clergy aside for the sake of the church .
new pope the archbishop is a high-profile figure and appeared on the world stage recently following the appointment of a new pope .
dr williams greeted the new pope in german he gave pope benedict xvi a pectoral cross as a present when he led anglican representatives in the vatican in a meeting with the pontiff .

the lot of an archbishop of canterbury has never been an easy one .
some , like thomas a becket , have been murdered .
others , most notably thomas cranmer , have met their end courtesy of the executioner .
archbishops have been used as political pawns by monarchs , ridiculed as meddlesome priests by politicians and scoffed at as wishy-washy liberals by the media .
but the 104th archbishop in the post faces contemporary crises .
a formidable theologian with an outstanding track record , dr williams , who published his first book at the age of 29 , was only 36 when he was appointed professor of divinity at oxford - the university 's youngest professor .
the blessing of the royal wedding at st george 's chapel was televised he is the first welshman - indeed he is a fluent welsh speaker - to serve as archbishop of canterbury for at least a millennium .
broad church dr williams ' major problem rests with his unique position .
as archbishop of canterbury he is leader of the 77 million-strong worldwide anglican communion but , unlike the pope , he has no power to force any of his 38 archbishops to submit to his will .
the broad nature of the church , which includes anglo-catholics , evangelicals and liberals , means that it is almost impossible for it to achieve unity on many controversial matters , including the ordination of women , human sexuality and relations with rome .
but he has proved he can engage with public debate - praising philip pullman 's his dark materials works , despite them being interpreted by some as anti-christian .
he then took part in a high-profile debate with the author .
in the church itself , whatever the divisions , he has also impressed with his intellect , common sense and charisma .

sir stuart hampson was speaking after the release of research commissioned by john lewis on the effect of charging on his firm 's business .
the report said there was a " direct link " between the charge and a drop in sales at its oxford street store .
edinburgh council wants to charge £ 2 a day to enter the city centre from 2006 .
the research was carried out by professor michael bell , of transport operations , and his team at imperial college in london .
it is our view that the current proposals are little more than a blunt instrument which will result in damaging edinburgh 's reputation as a major retail centre sir stuart hampson john lewis they analysed sales data from john lewis 's six london stores for a year , beginning in january 2003 .
other influences such as the central line closure , the war in iraq and tourism levels are said to have been factored out of the findings .
they showed that takings in john lewis 's oxford street store were down by 5.52 % .
the £ 5 a day congestion charge was introduced in london in february 2003 .
two-cordon plan a public inquiry opens in edinburgh on 27 april into the proposals for the scottish capital and is due to report in october .
the council wants to introduce two charging " cordons " - one in the city centre operating from 0700-1830 and an outer one inside the city bypass 0700-1000 .
there would be no charge for crossing the cordons at the weekend .
sir stuart said : " in edinburgh , we have said from the outset that we do not oppose congestion charging in principle but we firmly believe that if implemented in its current form , it will impose disproportionate consequential damage to the local economy .
the london charge is said to have caused a drop in sales " on that principle , we believe the edinburgh scheme should be a single cordon , peak hour scheme only .
" it is our view that the current proposals are little more than a blunt instrument which will result in damaging edinburgh 's reputation as a major retail centre . "
other retailers and opposition councillors have criticised the proposals from the labour-led administration .
but the group and council officials say congestion charging is needed to pay for transport options which tie together rail and road and the public and private sectors .
traffic in edinburgh is forecast to rise by a quarter by 2016 , increasing noise , pollution and road accidents , according to the council .
city centre promotion a spokesperson for transport initiatives edinburgh -lrb- tie -rrb- said the council proposed to allocate £ 15m over five years from the congestion charging proceeds , to fund the promotion of the city centre as an attractive and accessible destination .
all objections and representations submitted during the formal consultation period would be taken into account during the public inquiry .
tie is funding research by dtz pieda into the effects of congestion charging on retail businesses and the city centre economy .
the results are due out in september .
meanwhile , the charging plan face legal problems , according to west lothian council .
the authority says it has received advice that the proposal to share out money raised by the charges with other local authorities could be illegal .
