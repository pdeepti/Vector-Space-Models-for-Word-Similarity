to make their point , they spread out 11,000 dead fish on a 100 meter-long table in front of the brandenburg gate .
the fish were caught during a single two-hour commercial fishing expedition in the north sea last week , but sorted out and thrown away as " trash " by the fishermen because they were considered unsuitable for sale .
the discarded fish were later picked up by the greenpeace boat " esperanza " and brought to berlin for the protest .
according to thomas henningsen , a marine biologist for greenpeace , more than 700,000 fish are needlessly killed in such a manner every year and the practice should come to an end .
greenpeace is calling on officials to proclaim 40 percent of the north and baltic seas as protected areas in order to give the fish populations a chance to recover . more briefs 17.08.2004 -pipe- defense minister was n't just dizzy 16.08.2004 -pipe- ballack leads klinsmann 's national team 16.08.2004 -pipe- german defense minister back to work 16.08.2004 -pipe- green minister calls for minimum wage 16.08.2004 -pipe- german film wins silver leopard 13.08.2004 -pipe- eastern germans rally for more protests 13.08.2004 -pipe- german divorce rates reach new high 13.08.2004 -pipe- cologne acts to protect cathedral status 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the bank earned € 129 million -lrb- $ 159.1 million -rrb- and will remain on an upward course , according to the head of the bank 's board of directors , herbert walter , who said profits will triple in the foreseeable future .
gains at dresdner bank , however , could not help munich-based allianz , europe 's largest financial services company of which the dresdner bank is a division , return to profitability .
with net income down from € 662 million a year ago to € 614 million , second quarter earnings fell 7.2 percent .
the dresdner bank , which was purchased by allianz in 2001 , achieved its turnaround after allianz chief executive officer michael diekmann cut 4,700 jobs and shed bad loans .
analysts expect top allianz executives will now turn their attention to implementing similar measures company-wide in an effort to achieve similar ends . more briefs 16.08.2004 -pipe- study : german firms moving out of country 16.08.2004 -pipe- german industrial output increases 16.08.2004 -pipe- expert : social reforms will save € 10 billion 16.08.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn lowers operating losses 13.08.2004 -pipe- germany to issue libya export guarantees 13.08.2004 -pipe- newspaper : vultures funds want tui 13.08.2004 -pipe- passenger numbers up at frankfurt 12.08.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler managers accept pay cuts 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .
each relief organization makes its own assessment and from that , there ought to be one -lrb- assessment -rrb- that they all can use .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .
each relief organization makes its own assessment and from that , there ought to be one -lrb- assessment -rrb- that they all can use .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2004 thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said more than 90,000 people demonstrated monday tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms . police said 15,000 protestors marched to the headquarters of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in central berlin in a noisy but peaceful protest against the biggest overhaul of germany 's generous welfare system in decades .
in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .
for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country .

the bank earned € 129 million -lrb- $ 159.1 million -rrb- and will remain on an upward course , according to the head of the bank 's board of directors , herbert walter , who said profits will triple in the foreseeable future .
gains at dresdner bank , however , could not help munich-based allianz , europe 's largest financial services company of which the dresdner bank is a division , return to profitability .
with net income down from € 662 million a year ago to € 614 million , second quarter earnings fell 7.2 percent .
the dresdner bank , which was purchased by allianz in 2001 , achieved its turnaround after allianz chief executive officer michael diekmann cut 4,700 jobs and shed bad loans .
analysts expect top allianz executives will now turn their attention to implementing similar measures company-wide in an effort to achieve similar ends . more briefs 16.08.2004 -pipe- study : german firms moving out of country 16.08.2004 -pipe- german industrial output increases 16.08.2004 -pipe- expert : social reforms will save € 10 billion 16.08.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn lowers operating losses 13.08.2004 -pipe- germany to issue libya export guarantees 13.08.2004 -pipe- newspaper : vultures funds want tui 13.08.2004 -pipe- passenger numbers up at frankfurt 12.08.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler managers accept pay cuts 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" it was a construction site , but it was really fun to work in that environment , " wiesmann told dw-world .
" it was very productive . " now the computer specialist is hoping to replicate that atmosphere for artists .
he has transformed a former monastery in the middle of essen into a " creative center " to give young artists a chance to focus on their work without having to worry about paying the rent . " everyone who has something to offer gets a room free of charge , " wiesemann said , adding that artists just have to present ideas that are creative , interesting and legal . besides the space , the basement of the unperfekthaus , or imperfect house , is filled with materials , such as wood and paint , that ompanies have donated to the project . while the building 's official opening is scheduled for october , 140 artists have already begun working in studios on six floors . imperfection sparks creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unperfekthaus in essen the house lacks a coherent design , but that 's part of the concept to encourage creativity , wiesemann said .

visitors coming to the house can , among other things , watch artists working in their studios , participate in yoga classes or attend lectures . " if things keep going the way they are , the project will finance itself , " he said . petra salhöfer , who directs essen 's culture office , said she welcomed the center .

investors are " concerned that the recovery 's dynamic is weakening because uncertainties about the development of the global economy and the oil price have increase , " zew president wolfgang franz said in a statement , according to bloomberg news service .
it 's a sentiment shared by the officials at germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
" the desired domestic demand revival could be hampered by further oil price increases , " bank officials wrote in their monthly report released monday .
the high price of oil already lowered exports in june .
exports were mainly responsible for the 2 percent growth germany experienced in the first half of 2004 compared to 2003 .
continuing high prices could create a major problems for germany , europe 's largest economy , experts said .
" the biggest risk for the economy is the oil price , " jonathan hoffman , chief european economist at royal bank of scotland in london told bloomberg news service .
" we 've seen the peak in growth in the second quarter .
from here , the recovery will proceed at slower rates . "
global uncertainty keeps prices up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuelan president hugo chavez even after venezuela 's president hugo chavez -lrb- photo -rrb- won a recall referendum and promised to keep the world 's fifth largest crude exporter 's oil flowing , fighting in iraq , possible terror attacks in saudi arabia and lingering shipment delay concerns about russia 's largest oil producer , yukos , are reason enough to keep german experts nervous .
" a $ 10 -lrb- € 8.13 -rrb- per barrel risk premium would raise the german oil bill to $ 27 million -lrb- € 33.21 million -rrb- a day , " credit suisse 's oil expert jeremy baker told the financial times deutschland .

horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to kohl 's cdu , is also accused of aiding and abetting the breach of trust . shady transfers of cash the defendants have been charged with moving nearly € 10.6 million -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- in funds from the hesse state branch to secret bank accounts in switzerland and then via liechtenstein back to germany to avoid financial reporting requirements in the 1980s .
the money is said to have been used to fund election campaigns between the end of 1982 and january 2000 without the knowledge of the party 's executive , wiesbaden prosecutor 's spokesman klaus schulte said in an interview . " they neither harmed the party nor privately enriched themselves , but depriving those responsible within the party of the power to dispose of the money is also considered a crime , " schulte said in the opening statement .
the offense carries a prison term of up to five years , he said . kohl got sleaze ball rolling in 1999 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl the scandal really exploded in 1999 , when kohl admitted in december of that year , 12 months after he and his party lost power , that he had accepted around € 1 million in cash from unidentified donors .
he has refused to name the donors ever since , but has vehemently denied that decisions by his government were bought during his 16 years in power . the scandal spread when wolfgang schäuble took over as cdu party chairman after kohl quit , only to resign a few weeks later over other cash donations that were n't registered in the party 's accounts as required by law . administration under investigation then , in 2001 , the wiesbaden prosecutor brought charges related to the cdu 's funds in the state of hesse against kanther , who headed the cdu hesse branch and was state finance minister between 1987 and 1991 .
the court 's economic panel ruled that the statute of limitations applied as the money had been transferred to switzerland more than five years earlier , schulte said . the frankfurt higher regional court then overturned that ruling after the prosecutor appealed , arguing that the five-year limitation should only apply from the time the money was brought back to germany . the trial is scheduled to last until december , with hesse 's christian democratic premier , roland koch , among witnesses scheduled to appear . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over kohl 's stasi files continues files compiled by the former east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- on former german chancellor helmut kohl could become public despite a recent court ruling imposing major restrictions on their publication .

on monday , it was revealed that there was a new young lady on the scene : his freshly adopted three-year old daughter , viktoria . german chancellor gerhard schröder was so touched by the plight of many orphaned children in russia that he and his wife doris decided to help .
not for the chancellor a hefty donation to the charity of his choice , instead mr. and mrs. schröder decided to give one of the under-privileged kids a new start in life by adopting her .
viktoria , a three-year old from st. petersburg , has reportedly been living in the couple 's house in hanover with the family , including frau schröder-kopf 's 13-year old daughter klara from her first marriage , for " several weeks , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported monday .

but many are shoddy businesses seeking to make a quick euro .
one national group is trying to set high standards for the industry . the idea that the body needs to be kept in good shape is n't a notion held exclusively by modern olympic athletes - it 's a concept that was shared by sport heroes in ancient times , too .
for the past several years , stressed-out people in germany have begun to better appreciate their bodies .
" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .
but what 's behind this new wave of contentedness ?
is the wellness movement really something that helps improve people 's lives or is it just a fashionable trend with little actual effect ?
first created about a decade ago , the term wellness started in the united states as a way of combining the concepts of fitness and well-being .
wellness leaps the big pond the american pioneers of the wellness movement were seeking to sink the health care costs - and not without reason .
our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .
that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .

" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .

but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bratwurst and burgers german-americans : more than bratwurst & beer " fahrenheit 9/11 " set to heat up germany one year later , germany anything but smug over iraq war us investors still like germany business -pipe- 17.08.2004 us troop pullout to hit local german economies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer us soldiers in germany mean fewer euros for the economy the impact of us plans to pull some 70,000 troops out of europe and asia is likely to be felt most acutely in germany - especially in smaller towns whose economies depend on the us presence . when members of the us military in germany want help organizing a little r & r off base , one place they often go is rtt destinations unlimited , a travel agency headquartered at the ramstein air force base in southwestern germany .
however , if the bush administration moves forward with its troop redeployment plans , about half of those soldiers stationed in germany could be leaving . " if they pull out , it would certainly hit us , " gisela paulus , rtt 's manager , told dw-world .
" but it would even be worse for the smaller bus companies who serve other smaller bases around germany .
they would see their numbers cut drastically . " monday 's announcement by us president george w. bush that large numbers of troops will be possibly withdrawn from europe over the next five to six years has serious ramifications for the economies of some german regions around american bases . the bush administration has said it is not " punishing " germany for its continued opposition to the us invasion of iraq , rather it wants to restructure its troop deployment to meet 21st century needs , such as the new threats posed by international terrorism .
the current us alignment here is better equipped to fend off a soviet tank attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in the iraq it is estimated that up to one-half of the 71,000 troops currently in germany could be sent home or redeployed to bases in southern or southeastern europe , closer to hotspots in the middle east .
thousands of military support staff and military families are expected to pack their bags as well . " that has all kinds of repercussions , especially for the economy " dennis phelps of the american-german business club told dw-world .
" there is a whole american infrastructure here - american houses , american schools - when the military pulls out , these things close .
it also means that soldiers are spending money in local shops or paying local landlords rents . " long , strong history since the us entered the country during world war ii , it has been a steady , and mostly appreciated presence in germany .
after the surrender of the nazis , gis were welcomed by many as liberators .
as the cold war began heating up , more and more us troops were stationed in germany , mostly in the south and southwest of the country . during the 1950s and 1960s , the united states had a presence in more than 500 cities and towns throughout germany , according to phelps .
since 1945 , some 17 million americans have served tours of duty in germany . the long residency has left its stamp , not to mention on those communities with weak industrial bases , for which the nearby us military has become an essential economic engine . the district of birkenfeld is one such area that could be hit hard .
up to 20 percent of gdp is dependent on the baumholder military base in the region where parts of the 1st infantry division are now stationed . " a closure could have enormous ramifications for us , " werner knauth , press spokesman for the district , told dw-world . please stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration at ramstein air base on march 20 , 2004 against the war in iraq .
despite substantial anger among the german populace at us actions in iraq -lrb- photo -rrb- , and protests at some bases , many germans see the economic considerations outweighing moral ones when it comes to a continuing presence of american troops in the neighborhood .
officials have begun doing what they can to convince the americans to stay . " we 're now in negotiations with the americans , trying to make it appealing for them to stay at their current sites , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate , where several bases including baumholder are located .
" we 're talking to the us about not just closing the base , but using it differently , perhaps as a training ground . " in fact , authorities are used to talking about conversion , since a substantial cut-back in us force strength has already taken place since the end of the cold war .
in the mid 1990s , cities such as frankfurt and berlin said good-bye to many of their us troops who were no longer needed after the berlin wall fell and the soviet threat came to an end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a few conversion success stories , such as the hahn air base which closed in 1995 .
the base and the region got a breath of new life when the popular low-cost airline ryanair discovered it and made it its hub in central germany . state officials in rhineland-palatinate can be thankful that two of the largest bases in the region , the ramstein and spangdahlem air bases , are not threatened with closure , even though there could be some troop reduction .
the two make up the largest us military communities outside the united states , and are home to 40,000 soldiers and their dependents .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .

german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2004 bush : " our posture must change " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush speaking to veterans after the announcement us president george w. bush has announced plans to shift up to 70,000 us troops stationed in western europe and asia .
some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country . " for decades , american armed forces abroad have essentially remained where the wars of the last century ended - in europe and in asia , " bush said . old enemies have disappeared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the us army stationed in germany preparing for a mission to iraq us troops were based in large numbers in germany during the cold war to deter a soviet invasion .
the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .

" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .

" the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .

but many are shoddy businesses seeking to make a quick euro .
one national group is trying to set high standards for the industry . the idea that the body needs to be kept in good shape is n't a notion held exclusively by modern olympic athletes - it 's a concept that was shared by sport heroes in ancient times , too .
for the past several years , stressed-out people in germany have begun to better appreciate their bodies .
" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .
but what 's behind this new wave of contentedness ?
is the wellness movement really something that helps improve people 's lives or is it just a fashionable trend with little actual effect ?
first created about a decade ago , the term wellness started in the united states as a way of combining the concepts of fitness and well-being .
wellness leaps the big pond the american pioneers of the wellness movement were seeking to sink the health care costs - and not without reason .
our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .

" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .

wellness leaps the big pond the american pioneers of the wellness movement were seeking to sink the health care costs - and not without reason .
our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .
that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .

keller is also an opponent of uncontrolled growth in the wellness business , which has attracted many new companies in a short amount of time .
keller complains that a lot of companies are n't giving employees adequate training for the wellness treatments they offer .

investors are " concerned that the recovery 's dynamic is weakening because uncertainties about the development of the global economy and the oil price have increase , " zew president wolfgang franz said in a statement , according to bloomberg news service .
it 's a sentiment shared by the officials at germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
" the desired domestic demand revival could be hampered by further oil price increases , " bank officials wrote in their monthly report released monday .
the high price of oil already lowered exports in june .
exports were mainly responsible for the 2 percent growth germany experienced in the first half of 2004 compared to 2003 .
continuing high prices could create a major problems for germany , europe 's largest economy , experts said .
" the biggest risk for the economy is the oil price , " jonathan hoffman , chief european economist at royal bank of scotland in london told bloomberg news service .

but there is little the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- can do to lower prices , according to the cartel 's governor , kazempour ardebili .
opec member countries , which are responsible for providing about half the world 's oil exports , are already pumping a 25-year high of 30 million barrels per day .
on monday , oil prices , which have gone up 44 percent this year , reached a new high of $ 46.91 per barrel -lrb- 159 liters -rrb- of us light crude , while a barrel of north sea brent crude also hit a record $ 44.11 in new york and london . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country . " for decades , american armed forces abroad have essentially remained where the wars of the last century ended - in europe and in asia , " bush said . old enemies have disappeared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the us army stationed in germany preparing for a mission to iraq us troops were based in large numbers in germany during the cold war to deter a soviet invasion .
the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country .

the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

11 terror cell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq claims he knew nothing about the terror plans a moroccan on trial in germany for suspected involvement in the sept .
11 attacks was a member of a radical group that believed " something had to be done against america , " a witness testified tuesday . the testimony came just days after us authorities had released transcripts of interviews with ramzi binalshibh , the alleged organizer of the sept .
11 attacks .
binalshibh had exonerated mounir el motassadeq , saying that the moroccan had no knowledge of the terror plans . but on tuesday , shahid nickels , a 23-year-old german student , said motassadeq belonged to the inner circle of a radical group promoting attacks against the us and israel . nickels said he met motassadeq and the others in 1997 at hamburg 's radical al-quds mosque , where he attended a quran study class led by mohammed atta , the alleged leader of the attacks , ap news agency reported . according to nickels , the group believed that " israel did n't have the right to statehood and suicide attacks were legitimate .
in america , they believed that the jews had a lot of power . " he said that by late 1999 , the group 's conversations were " all about jihad . " " they said that something had to be done against america , " said nickels , the first of more than 30 witnesses scheduled to appear at the trial , according to ap . motassadeq is on retrial after a german appeals court overturned a 2003 conviction in an earlier trial .
he had been serving a 15-year sentence for his involvement in the attacks , but was released from prison in april pending his retrial . nickels ' testimony during the first trial had played a crucial role in convicting motassadeq .
on tuesday , he said that he distanced himself from the group .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .
each relief organization makes its own assessment and from that , there ought to be one -lrb- assessment -rrb- that they all can use .

" it 's staggering that a single german teenager can have such a dramatic influence , " graham cluley of sophos , a company specializing in anti-virus programs , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal computer with virus alert on the screen altogether , sophos experts registered 4,677 new viruses -lrb- which reproduce using a host program -rrb- , worms -lrb- which reproduce without a host program -rrb- and so-called trojans -lrb- which secretly execute other changes to computer programs -rrb- since january . all of these attack programs have short shelf lives and disappear almost as quickly as they emerge . jaschan used security gaps in microsoft 's operating programs windows xp and windows 2000 to spread his programs .
sasser traveled directly from computer to computer and not - as usual - via e-mail attachment ; a simple internet connection was sufficient to infect unprotected computers .
after an attack , the worm immediately started 128 consecutive attacks via the internet or within a local network . good intentions ? but jaschan 's original intention had been to create a " good " worm that would hunt " bad " worms throughout the internet .
his goal was to disarm worms such as mydoom and bagle , which were making their damaging way through the web at the time .
jaschan sent netsky and sasser to infect computers and start " cleaning up " infections from previous worms . the self-proclaimed internet policeman apparently lacked the programming knowledge to prevent harm to computers .

jaschan said he had not planned this , but could n't solve the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft headquarters " sasser was meant to be a warning shot , " jaschan said , adding that he was n't a criminal programmer , but rather intended to alert the public to security holes that had to be fixed by microsoft . it 's still unclear how much damage sasser caused - so far , 30 to 40 claims have been submitted , according to jaschan 's defense attorney .
they range from € 45 -lrb- $ 55.5 -rrb- to € 3,500 . suits against jaschan are not likely to reach exorbitant proportions .

investors are " concerned that the recovery 's dynamic is weakening because uncertainties about the development of the global economy and the oil price have increase , " zew president wolfgang franz said in a statement , according to bloomberg news service .
it 's a sentiment shared by the officials at germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
" the desired domestic demand revival could be hampered by further oil price increases , " bank officials wrote in their monthly report released monday .
the high price of oil already lowered exports in june .
exports were mainly responsible for the 2 percent growth germany experienced in the first half of 2004 compared to 2003 .
continuing high prices could create a major problems for germany , europe 's largest economy , experts said .

but there is little the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- can do to lower prices , according to the cartel 's governor , kazempour ardebili .
opec member countries , which are responsible for providing about half the world 's oil exports , are already pumping a 25-year high of 30 million barrels per day .
on monday , oil prices , which have gone up 44 percent this year , reached a new high of $ 46.91 per barrel -lrb- 159 liters -rrb- of us light crude , while a barrel of north sea brent crude also hit a record $ 44.11 in new york and london . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

however , if the bush administration moves forward with its troop redeployment plans , about half of those soldiers stationed in germany could be leaving . " if they pull out , it would certainly hit us , " gisela paulus , rtt 's manager , told dw-world .
" but it would even be worse for the smaller bus companies who serve other smaller bases around germany .
they would see their numbers cut drastically . " monday 's announcement by us president george w. bush that large numbers of troops will be possibly withdrawn from europe over the next five to six years has serious ramifications for the economies of some german regions around american bases . the bush administration has said it is not " punishing " germany for its continued opposition to the us invasion of iraq , rather it wants to restructure its troop deployment to meet 21st century needs , such as the new threats posed by international terrorism .
the current us alignment here is better equipped to fend off a soviet tank attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in the iraq it is estimated that up to one-half of the 71,000 troops currently in germany could be sent home or redeployed to bases in southern or southeastern europe , closer to hotspots in the middle east .
thousands of military support staff and military families are expected to pack their bags as well . " that has all kinds of repercussions , especially for the economy " dennis phelps of the american-german business club told dw-world .
" there is a whole american infrastructure here - american houses , american schools - when the military pulls out , these things close .
it also means that soldiers are spending money in local shops or paying local landlords rents . " long , strong history since the us entered the country during world war ii , it has been a steady , and mostly appreciated presence in germany .
after the surrender of the nazis , gis were welcomed by many as liberators .
as the cold war began heating up , more and more us troops were stationed in germany , mostly in the south and southwest of the country . during the 1950s and 1960s , the united states had a presence in more than 500 cities and towns throughout germany , according to phelps .
since 1945 , some 17 million americans have served tours of duty in germany . the long residency has left its stamp , not to mention on those communities with weak industrial bases , for which the nearby us military has become an essential economic engine . the district of birkenfeld is one such area that could be hit hard .
up to 20 percent of gdp is dependent on the baumholder military base in the region where parts of the 1st infantry division are now stationed . " a closure could have enormous ramifications for us , " werner knauth , press spokesman for the district , told dw-world . please stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration at ramstein air base on march 20 , 2004 against the war in iraq .
despite substantial anger among the german populace at us actions in iraq -lrb- photo -rrb- , and protests at some bases , many germans see the economic considerations outweighing moral ones when it comes to a continuing presence of american troops in the neighborhood .
officials have begun doing what they can to convince the americans to stay . " we 're now in negotiations with the americans , trying to make it appealing for them to stay at their current sites , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate , where several bases including baumholder are located .
" we 're talking to the us about not just closing the base , but using it differently , perhaps as a training ground . " in fact , authorities are used to talking about conversion , since a substantial cut-back in us force strength has already taken place since the end of the cold war .
in the mid 1990s , cities such as frankfurt and berlin said good-bye to many of their us troops who were no longer needed after the berlin wall fell and the soviet threat came to an end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a few conversion success stories , such as the hahn air base which closed in 1995 .
the base and the region got a breath of new life when the popular low-cost airline ryanair discovered it and made it its hub in central germany . state officials in rhineland-palatinate can be thankful that two of the largest bases in the region , the ramstein and spangdahlem air bases , are not threatened with closure , even though there could be some troop reduction .
the two make up the largest us military communities outside the united states , and are home to 40,000 soldiers and their dependents .
a study by the university of trier showed that the two bases alone contributed about € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- to the local economy in 2001 and support about 27,000 jobs in the region . even though many troops there will stay , local businesses have already begun gearing up for a loss . " things will change , " volker menzel , president of the japanese garden in kaiserslautern , a popular destination for military families near ramstein , told dw-world .

" but it would even be worse for the smaller bus companies who serve other smaller bases around germany .
they would see their numbers cut drastically . " monday 's announcement by us president george w. bush that large numbers of troops will be possibly withdrawn from europe over the next five to six years has serious ramifications for the economies of some german regions around american bases . the bush administration has said it is not " punishing " germany for its continued opposition to the us invasion of iraq , rather it wants to restructure its troop deployment to meet 21st century needs , such as the new threats posed by international terrorism .
the current us alignment here is better equipped to fend off a soviet tank attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in the iraq it is estimated that up to one-half of the 71,000 troops currently in germany could be sent home or redeployed to bases in southern or southeastern europe , closer to hotspots in the middle east .
thousands of military support staff and military families are expected to pack their bags as well . " that has all kinds of repercussions , especially for the economy " dennis phelps of the american-german business club told dw-world .
" there is a whole american infrastructure here - american houses , american schools - when the military pulls out , these things close .
it also means that soldiers are spending money in local shops or paying local landlords rents . " long , strong history since the us entered the country during world war ii , it has been a steady , and mostly appreciated presence in germany .
after the surrender of the nazis , gis were welcomed by many as liberators .
as the cold war began heating up , more and more us troops were stationed in germany , mostly in the south and southwest of the country . during the 1950s and 1960s , the united states had a presence in more than 500 cities and towns throughout germany , according to phelps .
since 1945 , some 17 million americans have served tours of duty in germany . the long residency has left its stamp , not to mention on those communities with weak industrial bases , for which the nearby us military has become an essential economic engine . the district of birkenfeld is one such area that could be hit hard .
up to 20 percent of gdp is dependent on the baumholder military base in the region where parts of the 1st infantry division are now stationed . " a closure could have enormous ramifications for us , " werner knauth , press spokesman for the district , told dw-world . please stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration at ramstein air base on march 20 , 2004 against the war in iraq .
despite substantial anger among the german populace at us actions in iraq -lrb- photo -rrb- , and protests at some bases , many germans see the economic considerations outweighing moral ones when it comes to a continuing presence of american troops in the neighborhood .
officials have begun doing what they can to convince the americans to stay . " we 're now in negotiations with the americans , trying to make it appealing for them to stay at their current sites , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate , where several bases including baumholder are located .
" we 're talking to the us about not just closing the base , but using it differently , perhaps as a training ground . " in fact , authorities are used to talking about conversion , since a substantial cut-back in us force strength has already taken place since the end of the cold war .
in the mid 1990s , cities such as frankfurt and berlin said good-bye to many of their us troops who were no longer needed after the berlin wall fell and the soviet threat came to an end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a few conversion success stories , such as the hahn air base which closed in 1995 .
the base and the region got a breath of new life when the popular low-cost airline ryanair discovered it and made it its hub in central germany . state officials in rhineland-palatinate can be thankful that two of the largest bases in the region , the ramstein and spangdahlem air bases , are not threatened with closure , even though there could be some troop reduction .
the two make up the largest us military communities outside the united states , and are home to 40,000 soldiers and their dependents .
a study by the university of trier showed that the two bases alone contributed about € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- to the local economy in 2001 and support about 27,000 jobs in the region . even though many troops there will stay , local businesses have already begun gearing up for a loss . " things will change , " volker menzel , president of the japanese garden in kaiserslautern , a popular destination for military families near ramstein , told dw-world .

as the cold war began heating up , more and more us troops were stationed in germany , mostly in the south and southwest of the country . during the 1950s and 1960s , the united states had a presence in more than 500 cities and towns throughout germany , according to phelps .
since 1945 , some 17 million americans have served tours of duty in germany . the long residency has left its stamp , not to mention on those communities with weak industrial bases , for which the nearby us military has become an essential economic engine . the district of birkenfeld is one such area that could be hit hard .
up to 20 percent of gdp is dependent on the baumholder military base in the region where parts of the 1st infantry division are now stationed . " a closure could have enormous ramifications for us , " werner knauth , press spokesman for the district , told dw-world . please stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration at ramstein air base on march 20 , 2004 against the war in iraq .
despite substantial anger among the german populace at us actions in iraq -lrb- photo -rrb- , and protests at some bases , many germans see the economic considerations outweighing moral ones when it comes to a continuing presence of american troops in the neighborhood .
officials have begun doing what they can to convince the americans to stay . " we 're now in negotiations with the americans , trying to make it appealing for them to stay at their current sites , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate , where several bases including baumholder are located .
" we 're talking to the us about not just closing the base , but using it differently , perhaps as a training ground . " in fact , authorities are used to talking about conversion , since a substantial cut-back in us force strength has already taken place since the end of the cold war .
in the mid 1990s , cities such as frankfurt and berlin said good-bye to many of their us troops who were no longer needed after the berlin wall fell and the soviet threat came to an end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a few conversion success stories , such as the hahn air base which closed in 1995 .
the base and the region got a breath of new life when the popular low-cost airline ryanair discovered it and made it its hub in central germany . state officials in rhineland-palatinate can be thankful that two of the largest bases in the region , the ramstein and spangdahlem air bases , are not threatened with closure , even though there could be some troop reduction .
the two make up the largest us military communities outside the united states , and are home to 40,000 soldiers and their dependents .
a study by the university of trier showed that the two bases alone contributed about € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- to the local economy in 2001 and support about 27,000 jobs in the region . even though many troops there will stay , local businesses have already begun gearing up for a loss . " things will change , " volker menzel , president of the japanese garden in kaiserslautern , a popular destination for military families near ramstein , told dw-world .
" the army is such a significant factor here , the strength of the entire economy will diminish .

that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .

that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .

keller is also an opponent of uncontrolled growth in the wellness business , which has attracted many new companies in a short amount of time .
keller complains that a lot of companies are n't giving employees adequate training for the wellness treatments they offer .

but many are shoddy businesses seeking to make a quick euro .
one national group is trying to set high standards for the industry . the idea that the body needs to be kept in good shape is n't a notion held exclusively by modern olympic athletes - it 's a concept that was shared by sport heroes in ancient times , too .
for the past several years , stressed-out people in germany have begun to better appreciate their bodies .
" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .
but what 's behind this new wave of contentedness ?
is the wellness movement really something that helps improve people 's lives or is it just a fashionable trend with little actual effect ?
first created about a decade ago , the term wellness started in the united states as a way of combining the concepts of fitness and well-being .
wellness leaps the big pond the american pioneers of the wellness movement were seeking to sink the health care costs - and not without reason .
our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .

" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country . " for decades , american armed forces abroad have essentially remained where the wars of the last century ended - in europe and in asia , " bush said . old enemies have disappeared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the us army stationed in germany preparing for a mission to iraq us troops were based in large numbers in germany during the cold war to deter a soviet invasion .
the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

" it was a construction site , but it was really fun to work in that environment , " wiesmann told dw-world .
" it was very productive . " now the computer specialist is hoping to replicate that atmosphere for artists .
he has transformed a former monastery in the middle of essen into a " creative center " to give young artists a chance to focus on their work without having to worry about paying the rent . " everyone who has something to offer gets a room free of charge , " wiesemann said , adding that artists just have to present ideas that are creative , interesting and legal . besides the space , the basement of the unperfekthaus , or imperfect house , is filled with materials , such as wood and paint , that ompanies have donated to the project . while the building 's official opening is scheduled for october , 140 artists have already begun working in studios on six floors . imperfection sparks creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unperfekthaus in essen the house lacks a coherent design , but that 's part of the concept to encourage creativity , wiesemann said .

" the more the surroundings fade into the background , the more active people can become . " to fund the project , wiesemann charges admission .
visitors coming to the house can , among other things , watch artists working in their studios , participate in yoga classes or attend lectures . " if things keep going the way they are , the project will finance itself , " he said . petra salhöfer , who directs essen 's culture office , said she welcomed the center .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country . " for decades , american armed forces abroad have essentially remained where the wars of the last century ended - in europe and in asia , " bush said . old enemies have disappeared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the us army stationed in germany preparing for a mission to iraq us troops were based in large numbers in germany during the cold war to deter a soviet invasion .
the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2004 thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said more than 90,000 people demonstrated monday tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms . police said 15,000 protestors marched to the headquarters of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in central berlin in a noisy but peaceful protest against the biggest overhaul of germany 's generous welfare system in decades .
in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .
for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country .

" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .

our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .
that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .

keller complains that a lot of companies are n't giving employees adequate training for the wellness treatments they offer .

" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .

" monday 's announcement by us president george w. bush that large numbers of troops will be possibly withdrawn from europe over the next five to six years has serious ramifications for the economies of some german regions around american bases . the bush administration has said it is not " punishing " germany for its continued opposition to the us invasion of iraq , rather it wants to restructure its troop deployment to meet 21st century needs , such as the new threats posed by international terrorism .
the current us alignment here is better equipped to fend off a soviet tank attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in the iraq it is estimated that up to one-half of the 71,000 troops currently in germany could be sent home or redeployed to bases in southern or southeastern europe , closer to hotspots in the middle east .
thousands of military support staff and military families are expected to pack their bags as well . " that has all kinds of repercussions , especially for the economy " dennis phelps of the american-german business club told dw-world .
" there is a whole american infrastructure here - american houses , american schools - when the military pulls out , these things close .
it also means that soldiers are spending money in local shops or paying local landlords rents . " long , strong history since the us entered the country during world war ii , it has been a steady , and mostly appreciated presence in germany .
after the surrender of the nazis , gis were welcomed by many as liberators .
as the cold war began heating up , more and more us troops were stationed in germany , mostly in the south and southwest of the country . during the 1950s and 1960s , the united states had a presence in more than 500 cities and towns throughout germany , according to phelps .
since 1945 , some 17 million americans have served tours of duty in germany . the long residency has left its stamp , not to mention on those communities with weak industrial bases , for which the nearby us military has become an essential economic engine . the district of birkenfeld is one such area that could be hit hard .
up to 20 percent of gdp is dependent on the baumholder military base in the region where parts of the 1st infantry division are now stationed . " a closure could have enormous ramifications for us , " werner knauth , press spokesman for the district , told dw-world . please stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration at ramstein air base on march 20 , 2004 against the war in iraq .
despite substantial anger among the german populace at us actions in iraq -lrb- photo -rrb- , and protests at some bases , many germans see the economic considerations outweighing moral ones when it comes to a continuing presence of american troops in the neighborhood .
officials have begun doing what they can to convince the americans to stay . " we 're now in negotiations with the americans , trying to make it appealing for them to stay at their current sites , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate , where several bases including baumholder are located .
" we 're talking to the us about not just closing the base , but using it differently , perhaps as a training ground . " in fact , authorities are used to talking about conversion , since a substantial cut-back in us force strength has already taken place since the end of the cold war .
in the mid 1990s , cities such as frankfurt and berlin said good-bye to many of their us troops who were no longer needed after the berlin wall fell and the soviet threat came to an end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a few conversion success stories , such as the hahn air base which closed in 1995 .
the base and the region got a breath of new life when the popular low-cost airline ryanair discovered it and made it its hub in central germany . state officials in rhineland-palatinate can be thankful that two of the largest bases in the region , the ramstein and spangdahlem air bases , are not threatened with closure , even though there could be some troop reduction .
the two make up the largest us military communities outside the united states , and are home to 40,000 soldiers and their dependents .
a study by the university of trier showed that the two bases alone contributed about € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- to the local economy in 2001 and support about 27,000 jobs in the region . even though many troops there will stay , local businesses have already begun gearing up for a loss . " things will change , " volker menzel , president of the japanese garden in kaiserslautern , a popular destination for military families near ramstein , told dw-world .
" the army is such a significant factor here , the strength of the entire economy will diminish .

" it was a construction site , but it was really fun to work in that environment , " wiesmann told dw-world .
" it was very productive . " now the computer specialist is hoping to replicate that atmosphere for artists .
he has transformed a former monastery in the middle of essen into a " creative center " to give young artists a chance to focus on their work without having to worry about paying the rent . " everyone who has something to offer gets a room free of charge , " wiesemann said , adding that artists just have to present ideas that are creative , interesting and legal . besides the space , the basement of the unperfekthaus , or imperfect house , is filled with materials , such as wood and paint , that ompanies have donated to the project . while the building 's official opening is scheduled for october , 140 artists have already begun working in studios on six floors . imperfection sparks creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unperfekthaus in essen the house lacks a coherent design , but that 's part of the concept to encourage creativity , wiesemann said . " people can not do anything in a perfect environment and -lrb- just -rrb- become spectators , " he said .
" the more the surroundings fade into the background , the more active people can become . " to fund the project , wiesemann charges admission .
visitors coming to the house can , among other things , watch artists working in their studios , participate in yoga classes or attend lectures . " if things keep going the way they are , the project will finance itself , " he said . petra salhöfer , who directs essen 's culture office , said she welcomed the center . " it 's a great idea , " salhöfer said , adding that she hopes similar projects will be set up elsewhere as well to offer young artists a chance to get started . markus grunwald -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

investors are " concerned that the recovery 's dynamic is weakening because uncertainties about the development of the global economy and the oil price have increase , " zew president wolfgang franz said in a statement , according to bloomberg news service .
it 's a sentiment shared by the officials at germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
" the desired domestic demand revival could be hampered by further oil price increases , " bank officials wrote in their monthly report released monday .
the high price of oil already lowered exports in june .
exports were mainly responsible for the 2 percent growth germany experienced in the first half of 2004 compared to 2003 .
continuing high prices could create a major problems for germany , europe 's largest economy , experts said .
" the biggest risk for the economy is the oil price , " jonathan hoffman , chief european economist at royal bank of scotland in london told bloomberg news service .
" we 've seen the peak in growth in the second quarter .
from here , the recovery will proceed at slower rates . "
global uncertainty keeps prices up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : venezuelan president hugo chavez even after venezuela 's president hugo chavez -lrb- photo -rrb- won a recall referendum and promised to keep the world 's fifth largest crude exporter 's oil flowing , fighting in iraq , possible terror attacks in saudi arabia and lingering shipment delay concerns about russia 's largest oil producer , yukos , are reason enough to keep german experts nervous .
" a $ 10 -lrb- € 8.13 -rrb- per barrel risk premium would raise the german oil bill to $ 27 million -lrb- € 33.21 million -rrb- a day , " credit suisse 's oil expert jeremy baker told the financial times deutschland .
but there is little the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- can do to lower prices , according to the cartel 's governor , kazempour ardebili .
opec member countries , which are responsible for providing about half the world 's oil exports , are already pumping a 25-year high of 30 million barrels per day .
on monday , oil prices , which have gone up 44 percent this year , reached a new high of $ 46.91 per barrel -lrb- 159 liters -rrb- of us light crude , while a barrel of north sea brent crude also hit a record $ 44.11 in new york and london . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

sasser traveled directly from computer to computer and not - as usual - via e-mail attachment ; a simple internet connection was sufficient to infect unprotected computers .
after an attack , the worm immediately started 128 consecutive attacks via the internet or within a local network . good intentions ? but jaschan 's original intention had been to create a " good " worm that would hunt " bad " worms throughout the internet .
his goal was to disarm worms such as mydoom and bagle , which were making their damaging way through the web at the time .
jaschan sent netsky and sasser to infect computers and start " cleaning up " infections from previous worms . the self-proclaimed internet policeman apparently lacked the programming knowledge to prevent harm to computers .

they range from € 45 -lrb- $ 55.5 -rrb- to € 3,500 . suits against jaschan are not likely to reach exorbitant proportions .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .
each relief organization makes its own assessment and from that , there ought to be one -lrb- assessment -rrb- that they all can use .

however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .

however , if the bush administration moves forward with its troop redeployment plans , about half of those soldiers stationed in germany could be leaving . " if they pull out , it would certainly hit us , " gisela paulus , rtt 's manager , told dw-world .
" but it would even be worse for the smaller bus companies who serve other smaller bases around germany .
they would see their numbers cut drastically . " monday 's announcement by us president george w. bush that large numbers of troops will be possibly withdrawn from europe over the next five to six years has serious ramifications for the economies of some german regions around american bases . the bush administration has said it is not " punishing " germany for its continued opposition to the us invasion of iraq , rather it wants to restructure its troop deployment to meet 21st century needs , such as the new threats posed by international terrorism .
the current us alignment here is better equipped to fend off a soviet tank attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in the iraq it is estimated that up to one-half of the 71,000 troops currently in germany could be sent home or redeployed to bases in southern or southeastern europe , closer to hotspots in the middle east .
thousands of military support staff and military families are expected to pack their bags as well . " that has all kinds of repercussions , especially for the economy " dennis phelps of the american-german business club told dw-world .
" there is a whole american infrastructure here - american houses , american schools - when the military pulls out , these things close .
it also means that soldiers are spending money in local shops or paying local landlords rents . " long , strong history since the us entered the country during world war ii , it has been a steady , and mostly appreciated presence in germany .
after the surrender of the nazis , gis were welcomed by many as liberators .
as the cold war began heating up , more and more us troops were stationed in germany , mostly in the south and southwest of the country . during the 1950s and 1960s , the united states had a presence in more than 500 cities and towns throughout germany , according to phelps .
since 1945 , some 17 million americans have served tours of duty in germany . the long residency has left its stamp , not to mention on those communities with weak industrial bases , for which the nearby us military has become an essential economic engine . the district of birkenfeld is one such area that could be hit hard .
up to 20 percent of gdp is dependent on the baumholder military base in the region where parts of the 1st infantry division are now stationed . " a closure could have enormous ramifications for us , " werner knauth , press spokesman for the district , told dw-world . please stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration at ramstein air base on march 20 , 2004 against the war in iraq .
despite substantial anger among the german populace at us actions in iraq -lrb- photo -rrb- , and protests at some bases , many germans see the economic considerations outweighing moral ones when it comes to a continuing presence of american troops in the neighborhood .
officials have begun doing what they can to convince the americans to stay . " we 're now in negotiations with the americans , trying to make it appealing for them to stay at their current sites , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate , where several bases including baumholder are located .
" we 're talking to the us about not just closing the base , but using it differently , perhaps as a training ground . " in fact , authorities are used to talking about conversion , since a substantial cut-back in us force strength has already taken place since the end of the cold war .
in the mid 1990s , cities such as frankfurt and berlin said good-bye to many of their us troops who were no longer needed after the berlin wall fell and the soviet threat came to an end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a few conversion success stories , such as the hahn air base which closed in 1995 .
the base and the region got a breath of new life when the popular low-cost airline ryanair discovered it and made it its hub in central germany . state officials in rhineland-palatinate can be thankful that two of the largest bases in the region , the ramstein and spangdahlem air bases , are not threatened with closure , even though there could be some troop reduction .
the two make up the largest us military communities outside the united states , and are home to 40,000 soldiers and their dependents .
a study by the university of trier showed that the two bases alone contributed about € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- to the local economy in 2001 and support about 27,000 jobs in the region . even though many troops there will stay , local businesses have already begun gearing up for a loss . " things will change , " volker menzel , president of the japanese garden in kaiserslautern , a popular destination for military families near ramstein , told dw-world .
" the army is such a significant factor here , the strength of the entire economy will diminish . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. troop pullout would hit germany hard u.s. soldiers and their families pump billions of dollars into germany 's economy .

11 terror cell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq claims he knew nothing about the terror plans a moroccan on trial in germany for suspected involvement in the sept .
11 attacks was a member of a radical group that believed " something had to be done against america , " a witness testified tuesday . the testimony came just days after us authorities had released transcripts of interviews with ramzi binalshibh , the alleged organizer of the sept .
11 attacks .
binalshibh had exonerated mounir el motassadeq , saying that the moroccan had no knowledge of the terror plans . but on tuesday , shahid nickels , a 23-year-old german student , said motassadeq belonged to the inner circle of a radical group promoting attacks against the us and israel . nickels said he met motassadeq and the others in 1997 at hamburg 's radical al-quds mosque , where he attended a quran study class led by mohammed atta , the alleged leader of the attacks , ap news agency reported . according to nickels , the group believed that " israel did n't have the right to statehood and suicide attacks were legitimate .
in america , they believed that the jews had a lot of power . " he said that by late 1999 , the group 's conversations were " all about jihad . " " they said that something had to be done against america , " said nickels , the first of more than 30 witnesses scheduled to appear at the trial , according to ap . motassadeq is on retrial after a german appeals court overturned a 2003 conviction in an earlier trial .
he had been serving a 15-year sentence for his involvement in the attacks , but was released from prison in april pending his retrial . nickels ' testimony during the first trial had played a crucial role in convicting motassadeq .
on tuesday , he said that he distanced himself from the group .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country .

the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country . " for decades , american armed forces abroad have essentially remained where the wars of the last century ended - in europe and in asia , " bush said . old enemies have disappeared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the us army stationed in germany preparing for a mission to iraq us troops were based in large numbers in germany during the cold war to deter a soviet invasion .
the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .

leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .

but many are shoddy businesses seeking to make a quick euro .
one national group is trying to set high standards for the industry . the idea that the body needs to be kept in good shape is n't a notion held exclusively by modern olympic athletes - it 's a concept that was shared by sport heroes in ancient times , too .
for the past several years , stressed-out people in germany have begun to better appreciate their bodies .
" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .
but what 's behind this new wave of contentedness ?
is the wellness movement really something that helps improve people 's lives or is it just a fashionable trend with little actual effect ?
first created about a decade ago , the term wellness started in the united states as a way of combining the concepts of fitness and well-being .
wellness leaps the big pond the american pioneers of the wellness movement were seeking to sink the health care costs - and not without reason .
our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .
that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .

keller is also an opponent of uncontrolled growth in the wellness business , which has attracted many new companies in a short amount of time .
keller complains that a lot of companies are n't giving employees adequate training for the wellness treatments they offer .

" it was a construction site , but it was really fun to work in that environment , " wiesmann told dw-world .
" it was very productive . " now the computer specialist is hoping to replicate that atmosphere for artists .
he has transformed a former monastery in the middle of essen into a " creative center " to give young artists a chance to focus on their work without having to worry about paying the rent . " everyone who has something to offer gets a room free of charge , " wiesemann said , adding that artists just have to present ideas that are creative , interesting and legal . besides the space , the basement of the unperfekthaus , or imperfect house , is filled with materials , such as wood and paint , that ompanies have donated to the project . while the building 's official opening is scheduled for october , 140 artists have already begun working in studios on six floors . imperfection sparks creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unperfekthaus in essen the house lacks a coherent design , but that 's part of the concept to encourage creativity , wiesemann said . " people can not do anything in a perfect environment and -lrb- just -rrb- become spectators , " he said .
" the more the surroundings fade into the background , the more active people can become . " to fund the project , wiesemann charges admission .
visitors coming to the house can , among other things , watch artists working in their studios , participate in yoga classes or attend lectures . " if things keep going the way they are , the project will finance itself , " he said . petra salhöfer , who directs essen 's culture office , said she welcomed the center . " it 's a great idea , " salhöfer said , adding that she hopes similar projects will be set up elsewhere as well to offer young artists a chance to get started . markus grunwald -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the yearning for kraut art fresh blood has given the international popularity of german art a boost .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2004 germany 's world class computer worms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despair is how most people react once their computer has been hit a german teenager created some of the most harmful worms to hit computers around the world during the first half of 2004 , according to experts . sven jaschan , a student from a small town in the german state of lower saxony , made headlines earlier this year after admitting that he created the netsky and sasser worms that infected millions of computers around the globe . he was responsible for 70 percent of all worms that traveled through cyberspace in the first half of 2004 . " it 's staggering that a single german teenager can have such a dramatic influence , " graham cluley of sophos , a company specializing in anti-virus programs , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal computer with virus alert on the screen altogether , sophos experts registered 4,677 new viruses -lrb- which reproduce using a host program -rrb- , worms -lrb- which reproduce without a host program -rrb- and so-called trojans -lrb- which secretly execute other changes to computer programs -rrb- since january . all of these attack programs have short shelf lives and disappear almost as quickly as they emerge . jaschan used security gaps in microsoft 's operating programs windows xp and windows 2000 to spread his programs .
sasser traveled directly from computer to computer and not - as usual - via e-mail attachment ; a simple internet connection was sufficient to infect unprotected computers .
after an attack , the worm immediately started 128 consecutive attacks via the internet or within a local network . good intentions ? but jaschan 's original intention had been to create a " good " worm that would hunt " bad " worms throughout the internet .
his goal was to disarm worms such as mydoom and bagle , which were making their damaging way through the web at the time .
jaschan sent netsky and sasser to infect computers and start " cleaning up " infections from previous worms . the self-proclaimed internet policeman apparently lacked the programming knowledge to prevent harm to computers .
sasser shut down infected systems and restarted them .
jaschan said he had not planned this , but could n't solve the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft headquarters " sasser was meant to be a warning shot , " jaschan said , adding that he was n't a criminal programmer , but rather intended to alert the public to security holes that had to be fixed by microsoft . it 's still unclear how much damage sasser caused - so far , 30 to 40 claims have been submitted , according to jaschan 's defense attorney .
they range from € 45 -lrb- $ 55.5 -rrb- to € 3,500 . suits against jaschan are not likely to reach exorbitant proportions .

" it 's staggering that a single german teenager can have such a dramatic influence , " graham cluley of sophos , a company specializing in anti-virus programs , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal computer with virus alert on the screen altogether , sophos experts registered 4,677 new viruses -lrb- which reproduce using a host program -rrb- , worms -lrb- which reproduce without a host program -rrb- and so-called trojans -lrb- which secretly execute other changes to computer programs -rrb- since january . all of these attack programs have short shelf lives and disappear almost as quickly as they emerge . jaschan used security gaps in microsoft 's operating programs windows xp and windows 2000 to spread his programs .
sasser traveled directly from computer to computer and not - as usual - via e-mail attachment ; a simple internet connection was sufficient to infect unprotected computers .
after an attack , the worm immediately started 128 consecutive attacks via the internet or within a local network . good intentions ? but jaschan 's original intention had been to create a " good " worm that would hunt " bad " worms throughout the internet .
his goal was to disarm worms such as mydoom and bagle , which were making their damaging way through the web at the time .
jaschan sent netsky and sasser to infect computers and start " cleaning up " infections from previous worms . the self-proclaimed internet policeman apparently lacked the programming knowledge to prevent harm to computers .
sasser shut down infected systems and restarted them .
jaschan said he had not planned this , but could n't solve the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft headquarters " sasser was meant to be a warning shot , " jaschan said , adding that he was n't a criminal programmer , but rather intended to alert the public to security holes that had to be fixed by microsoft . it 's still unclear how much damage sasser caused - so far , 30 to 40 claims have been submitted , according to jaschan 's defense attorney .
they range from € 45 -lrb- $ 55.5 -rrb- to € 3,500 . suits against jaschan are not likely to reach exorbitant proportions .

to make their point , they spread out 11,000 dead fish on a 100 meter-long table in front of the brandenburg gate .
the fish were caught during a single two-hour commercial fishing expedition in the north sea last week , but sorted out and thrown away as " trash " by the fishermen because they were considered unsuitable for sale .
the discarded fish were later picked up by the greenpeace boat " esperanza " and brought to berlin for the protest .
according to thomas henningsen , a marine biologist for greenpeace , more than 700,000 fish are needlessly killed in such a manner every year and the practice should come to an end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.08.2004 no spa is too far for germans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massage is one of most lucrative aspects of germany 's wellness biz hundreds of companies pop up in germany every year as part of the growing wellness trend .
but many are shoddy businesses seeking to make a quick euro .
one national group is trying to set high standards for the industry . the idea that the body needs to be kept in good shape is n't a notion held exclusively by modern olympic athletes - it 's a concept that was shared by sport heroes in ancient times , too .
for the past several years , stressed-out people in germany have begun to better appreciate their bodies .
" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .
but what 's behind this new wave of contentedness ?
is the wellness movement really something that helps improve people 's lives or is it just a fashionable trend with little actual effect ?
first created about a decade ago , the term wellness started in the united states as a way of combining the concepts of fitness and well-being .
wellness leaps the big pond the american pioneers of the wellness movement were seeking to sink the health care costs - and not without reason .
our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .
that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .
proper training manfred keller is the owner of samudra , a health-oriented wellness facility that offers massage and so-called " floatings , " wellness treatments given in warm water .
keller is also an opponent of uncontrolled growth in the wellness business , which has attracted many new companies in a short amount of time .
keller complains that a lot of companies are n't giving employees adequate training for the wellness treatments they offer .
at his firm , workers receive traditional training that would be given to german spa employees who work with patients as medical bath attendants .
in doing so , he 's hoping to improve the burgeoning industry 's reputation . monika hoegen -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de say ' öm ' : for travelers , germany is yoga-friendly from berlin to cologne , hamburg to munich , modern-day germans are using yoga to get fit and explore the body-mind connection .

" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .
but what 's behind this new wave of contentedness ?
is the wellness movement really something that helps improve people 's lives or is it just a fashionable trend with little actual effect ?
first created about a decade ago , the term wellness started in the united states as a way of combining the concepts of fitness and well-being .

our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .
that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .

keller is also an opponent of uncontrolled growth in the wellness business , which has attracted many new companies in a short amount of time .
keller complains that a lot of companies are n't giving employees adequate training for the wellness treatments they offer .

but many are shoddy businesses seeking to make a quick euro .
one national group is trying to set high standards for the industry . the idea that the body needs to be kept in good shape is n't a notion held exclusively by modern olympic athletes - it 's a concept that was shared by sport heroes in ancient times , too .
for the past several years , stressed-out people in germany have begun to better appreciate their bodies .
" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .
but what 's behind this new wave of contentedness ?
is the wellness movement really something that helps improve people 's lives or is it just a fashionable trend with little actual effect ?
first created about a decade ago , the term wellness started in the united states as a way of combining the concepts of fitness and well-being .
wellness leaps the big pond the american pioneers of the wellness movement were seeking to sink the health care costs - and not without reason .
our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .
that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .
proper training manfred keller is the owner of samudra , a health-oriented wellness facility that offers massage and so-called " floatings , " wellness treatments given in warm water .
keller is also an opponent of uncontrolled growth in the wellness business , which has attracted many new companies in a short amount of time .
keller complains that a lot of companies are n't giving employees adequate training for the wellness treatments they offer .
at his firm , workers receive traditional training that would be given to german spa employees who work with patients as medical bath attendants .
in doing so , he 's hoping to improve the burgeoning industry 's reputation . monika hoegen -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de say ' öm ' : for travelers , germany is yoga-friendly from berlin to cologne , hamburg to munich , modern-day germans are using yoga to get fit and explore the body-mind connection .

11 attacks was a member of a radical group that believed " something had to be done against america , " a witness testified tuesday . the testimony came just days after us authorities had released transcripts of interviews with ramzi binalshibh , the alleged organizer of the sept .
11 attacks .
binalshibh had exonerated mounir el motassadeq , saying that the moroccan had no knowledge of the terror plans . but on tuesday , shahid nickels , a 23-year-old german student , said motassadeq belonged to the inner circle of a radical group promoting attacks against the us and israel . nickels said he met motassadeq and the others in 1997 at hamburg 's radical al-quds mosque , where he attended a quran study class led by mohammed atta , the alleged leader of the attacks , ap news agency reported . according to nickels , the group believed that " israel did n't have the right to statehood and suicide attacks were legitimate .
in america , they believed that the jews had a lot of power . " he said that by late 1999 , the group 's conversations were " all about jihad . " " they said that something had to be done against america , " said nickels , the first of more than 30 witnesses scheduled to appear at the trial , according to ap . motassadeq is on retrial after a german appeals court overturned a 2003 conviction in an earlier trial .
he had been serving a 15-year sentence for his involvement in the attacks , but was released from prison in april pending his retrial . nickels ' testimony during the first trial had played a crucial role in convicting motassadeq .
on tuesday , he said that he distanced himself from the group .

horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to kohl 's cdu , is also accused of aiding and abetting the breach of trust . shady transfers of cash the defendants have been charged with moving nearly € 10.6 million -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- in funds from the hesse state branch to secret bank accounts in switzerland and then via liechtenstein back to germany to avoid financial reporting requirements in the 1980s .
the money is said to have been used to fund election campaigns between the end of 1982 and january 2000 without the knowledge of the party 's executive , wiesbaden prosecutor 's spokesman klaus schulte said in an interview . " they neither harmed the party nor privately enriched themselves , but depriving those responsible within the party of the power to dispose of the money is also considered a crime , " schulte said in the opening statement .

he has refused to name the donors ever since , but has vehemently denied that decisions by his government were bought during his 16 years in power . the scandal spread when wolfgang schäuble took over as cdu party chairman after kohl quit , only to resign a few weeks later over other cash donations that were n't registered in the party 's accounts as required by law . administration under investigation then , in 2001 , the wiesbaden prosecutor brought charges related to the cdu 's funds in the state of hesse against kanther , who headed the cdu hesse branch and was state finance minister between 1987 and 1991 .
the court 's economic panel ruled that the statute of limitations applied as the money had been transferred to switzerland more than five years earlier , schulte said . the frankfurt higher regional court then overturned that ruling after the prosecutor appealed , arguing that the five-year limitation should only apply from the time the money was brought back to germany . the trial is scheduled to last until december , with hesse 's christian democratic premier , roland koch , among witnesses scheduled to appear . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over kohl 's stasi files continues files compiled by the former east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- on former german chancellor helmut kohl could become public despite a recent court ruling imposing major restrictions on their publication .

horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to kohl 's cdu , is also accused of aiding and abetting the breach of trust . shady transfers of cash the defendants have been charged with moving nearly € 10.6 million -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- in funds from the hesse state branch to secret bank accounts in switzerland and then via liechtenstein back to germany to avoid financial reporting requirements in the 1980s .
the money is said to have been used to fund election campaigns between the end of 1982 and january 2000 without the knowledge of the party 's executive , wiesbaden prosecutor 's spokesman klaus schulte said in an interview . " they neither harmed the party nor privately enriched themselves , but depriving those responsible within the party of the power to dispose of the money is also considered a crime , " schulte said in the opening statement .

he has refused to name the donors ever since , but has vehemently denied that decisions by his government were bought during his 16 years in power . the scandal spread when wolfgang schäuble took over as cdu party chairman after kohl quit , only to resign a few weeks later over other cash donations that were n't registered in the party 's accounts as required by law . administration under investigation then , in 2001 , the wiesbaden prosecutor brought charges related to the cdu 's funds in the state of hesse against kanther , who headed the cdu hesse branch and was state finance minister between 1987 and 1991 .
the court 's economic panel ruled that the statute of limitations applied as the money had been transferred to switzerland more than five years earlier , schulte said . the frankfurt higher regional court then overturned that ruling after the prosecutor appealed , arguing that the five-year limitation should only apply from the time the money was brought back to germany . the trial is scheduled to last until december , with hesse 's christian democratic premier , roland koch , among witnesses scheduled to appear . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over kohl 's stasi files continues files compiled by the former east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- on former german chancellor helmut kohl could become public despite a recent court ruling imposing major restrictions on their publication .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .
each relief organization makes its own assessment and from that , there ought to be one -lrb- assessment -rrb- that they all can use .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .
each relief organization makes its own assessment and from that , there ought to be one -lrb- assessment -rrb- that they all can use . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sudan irked by un resolution sudanese government officials are unhappy with the un resolution calling on it to do more to solve the problems of its darfur region .
a military official went so far as to describe it as a " declaration of war . "
-lrb- august 3 , 2004 -rrb- opinion : an impotent international community the un security council on friday gave sudan 30 days to stop the genocide in darfur without threatening the government with sanctions for non-compliance .

investors are " concerned that the recovery 's dynamic is weakening because uncertainties about the development of the global economy and the oil price have increase , " zew president wolfgang franz said in a statement , according to bloomberg news service .
it 's a sentiment shared by the officials at germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
" the desired domestic demand revival could be hampered by further oil price increases , " bank officials wrote in their monthly report released monday .
the high price of oil already lowered exports in june .
exports were mainly responsible for the 2 percent growth germany experienced in the first half of 2004 compared to 2003 .
continuing high prices could create a major problems for germany , europe 's largest economy , experts said .
" the biggest risk for the economy is the oil price , " jonathan hoffman , chief european economist at royal bank of scotland in london told bloomberg news service .
" we 've seen the peak in growth in the second quarter .
from here , the recovery will proceed at slower rates . "

" a $ 10 -lrb- € 8.13 -rrb- per barrel risk premium would raise the german oil bill to $ 27 million -lrb- € 33.21 million -rrb- a day , " credit suisse 's oil expert jeremy baker told the financial times deutschland .
but there is little the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- can do to lower prices , according to the cartel 's governor , kazempour ardebili .
opec member countries , which are responsible for providing about half the world 's oil exports , are already pumping a 25-year high of 30 million barrels per day .
on monday , oil prices , which have gone up 44 percent this year , reached a new high of $ 46.91 per barrel -lrb- 159 liters -rrb- of us light crude , while a barrel of north sea brent crude also hit a record $ 44.11 in new york and london . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .
after surging interest in the late 1990s , is germany 's romance with the stock market over ?

horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to kohl 's cdu , is also accused of aiding and abetting the breach of trust . shady transfers of cash the defendants have been charged with moving nearly € 10.6 million -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- in funds from the hesse state branch to secret bank accounts in switzerland and then via liechtenstein back to germany to avoid financial reporting requirements in the 1980s .
the money is said to have been used to fund election campaigns between the end of 1982 and january 2000 without the knowledge of the party 's executive , wiesbaden prosecutor 's spokesman klaus schulte said in an interview . " they neither harmed the party nor privately enriched themselves , but depriving those responsible within the party of the power to dispose of the money is also considered a crime , " schulte said in the opening statement .
the offense carries a prison term of up to five years , he said . kohl got sleaze ball rolling in 1999 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl the scandal really exploded in 1999 , when kohl admitted in december of that year , 12 months after he and his party lost power , that he had accepted around € 1 million in cash from unidentified donors .
he has refused to name the donors ever since , but has vehemently denied that decisions by his government were bought during his 16 years in power . the scandal spread when wolfgang schäuble took over as cdu party chairman after kohl quit , only to resign a few weeks later over other cash donations that were n't registered in the party 's accounts as required by law . administration under investigation then , in 2001 , the wiesbaden prosecutor brought charges related to the cdu 's funds in the state of hesse against kanther , who headed the cdu hesse branch and was state finance minister between 1987 and 1991 .

" it was a construction site , but it was really fun to work in that environment , " wiesmann told dw-world .
" it was very productive . " now the computer specialist is hoping to replicate that atmosphere for artists .
he has transformed a former monastery in the middle of essen into a " creative center " to give young artists a chance to focus on their work without having to worry about paying the rent . " everyone who has something to offer gets a room free of charge , " wiesemann said , adding that artists just have to present ideas that are creative , interesting and legal . besides the space , the basement of the unperfekthaus , or imperfect house , is filled with materials , such as wood and paint , that ompanies have donated to the project . while the building 's official opening is scheduled for october , 140 artists have already begun working in studios on six floors . imperfection sparks creativity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unperfekthaus in essen the house lacks a coherent design , but that 's part of the concept to encourage creativity , wiesemann said . " people can not do anything in a perfect environment and -lrb- just -rrb- become spectators , " he said .
" the more the surroundings fade into the background , the more active people can become . " to fund the project , wiesemann charges admission .
visitors coming to the house can , among other things , watch artists working in their studios , participate in yoga classes or attend lectures . " if things keep going the way they are , the project will finance itself , " he said . petra salhöfer , who directs essen 's culture office , said she welcomed the center .

11 terror cell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq claims he knew nothing about the terror plans a moroccan on trial in germany for suspected involvement in the sept .
11 attacks was a member of a radical group that believed " something had to be done against america , " a witness testified tuesday . the testimony came just days after us authorities had released transcripts of interviews with ramzi binalshibh , the alleged organizer of the sept .
11 attacks .
binalshibh had exonerated mounir el motassadeq , saying that the moroccan had no knowledge of the terror plans . but on tuesday , shahid nickels , a 23-year-old german student , said motassadeq belonged to the inner circle of a radical group promoting attacks against the us and israel . nickels said he met motassadeq and the others in 1997 at hamburg 's radical al-quds mosque , where he attended a quran study class led by mohammed atta , the alleged leader of the attacks , ap news agency reported . according to nickels , the group believed that " israel did n't have the right to statehood and suicide attacks were legitimate .
in america , they believed that the jews had a lot of power . " he said that by late 1999 , the group 's conversations were " all about jihad . " " they said that something had to be done against america , " said nickels , the first of more than 30 witnesses scheduled to appear at the trial , according to ap . motassadeq is on retrial after a german appeals court overturned a 2003 conviction in an earlier trial .
he had been serving a 15-year sentence for his involvement in the attacks , but was released from prison in april pending his retrial . nickels ' testimony during the first trial had played a crucial role in convicting motassadeq .
on tuesday , he said that he distanced himself from the group .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .

but many are shoddy businesses seeking to make a quick euro .
one national group is trying to set high standards for the industry . the idea that the body needs to be kept in good shape is n't a notion held exclusively by modern olympic athletes - it 's a concept that was shared by sport heroes in ancient times , too .
for the past several years , stressed-out people in germany have begun to better appreciate their bodies .
" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .
but what 's behind this new wave of contentedness ?
is the wellness movement really something that helps improve people 's lives or is it just a fashionable trend with little actual effect ?
first created about a decade ago , the term wellness started in the united states as a way of combining the concepts of fitness and well-being .
wellness leaps the big pond the american pioneers of the wellness movement were seeking to sink the health care costs - and not without reason .
our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .
that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you do n't have to cake yourself with mud to feel a sense of wellness , but it sure does feel good .
" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .
it just requires a more healthy attitude towards , well , health .
proper training manfred keller is the owner of samudra , a health-oriented wellness facility that offers massage and so-called " floatings , " wellness treatments given in warm water .
keller is also an opponent of uncontrolled growth in the wellness business , which has attracted many new companies in a short amount of time .
keller complains that a lot of companies are n't giving employees adequate training for the wellness treatments they offer .
at his firm , workers receive traditional training that would be given to german spa employees who work with patients as medical bath attendants .
in doing so , he 's hoping to improve the burgeoning industry 's reputation . monika hoegen -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de say ' öm ' : for travelers , germany is yoga-friendly from berlin to cologne , hamburg to munich , modern-day germans are using yoga to get fit and explore the body-mind connection .

" we want to try to create an image of a germany that has a population that is pleasurable and lives healthy - and for that to be understood as wellness , " said jürgen busch , the association 's deputy chairman .
" the idea is to stop the abuse of the term " wellness , " which is being used to market everything from wellness socks to wellness sausages to wellness water to overpriced wellness hotels , and instead promote the idea that people can take responsibility for their own health and well-being and experience the pleasure that comes from it . "
busch knows what he 's talking about .
as the manager of a large company , he fell seriously ill several years back .
the only thing that saved him was a complete change in just about every aspect of his life .
he stopped smoking , he tries not to get overly stressed at work and he 's become a vegetarian .
at first , it seemed he was just foregoing a lot of things in his life , but slowly his lifestyle change transformed itself into something that brought him pleasure .
today , busch is a wellness convert : to him , it 's a personal transformation you make in your life .
of course , that does n't mean you have to rule out the occasional visit to the massage parlor or vacation at a wellness hotel .
sorting the wellness from the chafe the real problem is that it 's hard to find the right ones in germany , at least if you believe the wellness association .
actually , the industry is booming and claims annual revenues of € 43 billion -lrb- $ 53 billion -rrb- .
but with so many companies clamoring to attach the catch-all term " wellness " to their products and services , you never really know what you 're going to get .
" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .
but it does n't have to be expensive or luxurious .
for very little money , anyone can experience greater well-being .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .

the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .

however , if the bush administration moves forward with its troop redeployment plans , about half of those soldiers stationed in germany could be leaving . " if they pull out , it would certainly hit us , " gisela paulus , rtt 's manager , told dw-world .
" but it would even be worse for the smaller bus companies who serve other smaller bases around germany .
they would see their numbers cut drastically . " monday 's announcement by us president george w. bush that large numbers of troops will be possibly withdrawn from europe over the next five to six years has serious ramifications for the economies of some german regions around american bases . the bush administration has said it is not " punishing " germany for its continued opposition to the us invasion of iraq , rather it wants to restructure its troop deployment to meet 21st century needs , such as the new threats posed by international terrorism .
the current us alignment here is better equipped to fend off a soviet tank attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in the iraq it is estimated that up to one-half of the 71,000 troops currently in germany could be sent home or redeployed to bases in southern or southeastern europe , closer to hotspots in the middle east .
thousands of military support staff and military families are expected to pack their bags as well . " that has all kinds of repercussions , especially for the economy " dennis phelps of the american-german business club told dw-world .
" there is a whole american infrastructure here - american houses , american schools - when the military pulls out , these things close .
it also means that soldiers are spending money in local shops or paying local landlords rents . " long , strong history since the us entered the country during world war ii , it has been a steady , and mostly appreciated presence in germany .
after the surrender of the nazis , gis were welcomed by many as liberators .
as the cold war began heating up , more and more us troops were stationed in germany , mostly in the south and southwest of the country . during the 1950s and 1960s , the united states had a presence in more than 500 cities and towns throughout germany , according to phelps .
since 1945 , some 17 million americans have served tours of duty in germany . the long residency has left its stamp , not to mention on those communities with weak industrial bases , for which the nearby us military has become an essential economic engine . the district of birkenfeld is one such area that could be hit hard .
up to 20 percent of gdp is dependent on the baumholder military base in the region where parts of the 1st infantry division are now stationed . " a closure could have enormous ramifications for us , " werner knauth , press spokesman for the district , told dw-world . please stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration at ramstein air base on march 20 , 2004 against the war in iraq .
despite substantial anger among the german populace at us actions in iraq -lrb- photo -rrb- , and protests at some bases , many germans see the economic considerations outweighing moral ones when it comes to a continuing presence of american troops in the neighborhood .
officials have begun doing what they can to convince the americans to stay . " we 're now in negotiations with the americans , trying to make it appealing for them to stay at their current sites , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate , where several bases including baumholder are located .
" we 're talking to the us about not just closing the base , but using it differently , perhaps as a training ground . " in fact , authorities are used to talking about conversion , since a substantial cut-back in us force strength has already taken place since the end of the cold war .
in the mid 1990s , cities such as frankfurt and berlin said good-bye to many of their us troops who were no longer needed after the berlin wall fell and the soviet threat came to an end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a few conversion success stories , such as the hahn air base which closed in 1995 .
the base and the region got a breath of new life when the popular low-cost airline ryanair discovered it and made it its hub in central germany . state officials in rhineland-palatinate can be thankful that two of the largest bases in the region , the ramstein and spangdahlem air bases , are not threatened with closure , even though there could be some troop reduction .
the two make up the largest us military communities outside the united states , and are home to 40,000 soldiers and their dependents .
a study by the university of trier showed that the two bases alone contributed about € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- to the local economy in 2001 and support about 27,000 jobs in the region . even though many troops there will stay , local businesses have already begun gearing up for a loss . " things will change , " volker menzel , president of the japanese garden in kaiserslautern , a popular destination for military families near ramstein , told dw-world .

the bank earned € 129 million -lrb- $ 159.1 million -rrb- and will remain on an upward course , according to the head of the bank 's board of directors , herbert walter , who said profits will triple in the foreseeable future .
gains at dresdner bank , however , could not help munich-based allianz , europe 's largest financial services company of which the dresdner bank is a division , return to profitability .
with net income down from € 662 million a year ago to € 614 million , second quarter earnings fell 7.2 percent .
the dresdner bank , which was purchased by allianz in 2001 , achieved its turnaround after allianz chief executive officer michael diekmann cut 4,700 jobs and shed bad loans .
analysts expect top allianz executives will now turn their attention to implementing similar measures company-wide in an effort to achieve similar ends . more briefs 16.08.2004 -pipe- study : german firms moving out of country 16.08.2004 -pipe- german industrial output increases 16.08.2004 -pipe- expert : social reforms will save € 10 billion 16.08.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn lowers operating losses 13.08.2004 -pipe- germany to issue libya export guarantees 13.08.2004 -pipe- newspaper : vultures funds want tui 13.08.2004 -pipe- passenger numbers up at frankfurt 12.08.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler managers accept pay cuts 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

to make their point , they spread out 11,000 dead fish on a 100 meter-long table in front of the brandenburg gate .
the fish were caught during a single two-hour commercial fishing expedition in the north sea last week , but sorted out and thrown away as " trash " by the fishermen because they were considered unsuitable for sale .
the discarded fish were later picked up by the greenpeace boat " esperanza " and brought to berlin for the protest .
according to thomas henningsen , a marine biologist for greenpeace , more than 700,000 fish are needlessly killed in such a manner every year and the practice should come to an end .

" it 's staggering that a single german teenager can have such a dramatic influence , " graham cluley of sophos , a company specializing in anti-virus programs , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal computer with virus alert on the screen altogether , sophos experts registered 4,677 new viruses -lrb- which reproduce using a host program -rrb- , worms -lrb- which reproduce without a host program -rrb- and so-called trojans -lrb- which secretly execute other changes to computer programs -rrb- since january . all of these attack programs have short shelf lives and disappear almost as quickly as they emerge . jaschan used security gaps in microsoft 's operating programs windows xp and windows 2000 to spread his programs .
sasser traveled directly from computer to computer and not - as usual - via e-mail attachment ; a simple internet connection was sufficient to infect unprotected computers .
after an attack , the worm immediately started 128 consecutive attacks via the internet or within a local network . good intentions ? but jaschan 's original intention had been to create a " good " worm that would hunt " bad " worms throughout the internet .
his goal was to disarm worms such as mydoom and bagle , which were making their damaging way through the web at the time .
jaschan sent netsky and sasser to infect computers and start " cleaning up " infections from previous worms . the self-proclaimed internet policeman apparently lacked the programming knowledge to prevent harm to computers .
sasser shut down infected systems and restarted them .
jaschan said he had not planned this , but could n't solve the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft headquarters " sasser was meant to be a warning shot , " jaschan said , adding that he was n't a criminal programmer , but rather intended to alert the public to security holes that had to be fixed by microsoft . it 's still unclear how much damage sasser caused - so far , 30 to 40 claims have been submitted , according to jaschan 's defense attorney .
they range from € 45 -lrb- $ 55.5 -rrb- to € 3,500 . suits against jaschan are not likely to reach exorbitant proportions .
but that 's probably not going to influence the computer sabotage criminal case that 's currently pending . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police call ' sasser ' programmer a bottom-feeding hacker an investigation into the suspected 18-year-old programmer of sasser offers a view of a hacking subculture that poses a serious threat because of its adherents ' inexperience .

the bank earned € 129 million -lrb- $ 159.1 million -rrb- and will remain on an upward course , according to the head of the bank 's board of directors , herbert walter , who said profits will triple in the foreseeable future .
gains at dresdner bank , however , could not help munich-based allianz , europe 's largest financial services company of which the dresdner bank is a division , return to profitability .
with net income down from € 662 million a year ago to € 614 million , second quarter earnings fell 7.2 percent .
the dresdner bank , which was purchased by allianz in 2001 , achieved its turnaround after allianz chief executive officer michael diekmann cut 4,700 jobs and shed bad loans .
analysts expect top allianz executives will now turn their attention to implementing similar measures company-wide in an effort to achieve similar ends . more briefs 16.08.2004 -pipe- study : german firms moving out of country 16.08.2004 -pipe- german industrial output increases 16.08.2004 -pipe- expert : social reforms will save € 10 billion 16.08.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn lowers operating losses 13.08.2004 -pipe- germany to issue libya export guarantees 13.08.2004 -pipe- newspaper : vultures funds want tui 13.08.2004 -pipe- passenger numbers up at frankfurt 12.08.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler managers accept pay cuts 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

to make their point , they spread out 11,000 dead fish on a 100 meter-long table in front of the brandenburg gate .
the fish were caught during a single two-hour commercial fishing expedition in the north sea last week , but sorted out and thrown away as " trash " by the fishermen because they were considered unsuitable for sale .
the discarded fish were later picked up by the greenpeace boat " esperanza " and brought to berlin for the protest .
according to thomas henningsen , a marine biologist for greenpeace , more than 700,000 fish are needlessly killed in such a manner every year and the practice should come to an end .
greenpeace is calling on officials to proclaim 40 percent of the north and baltic seas as protected areas in order to give the fish populations a chance to recover . more briefs 17.08.2004 -pipe- defense minister was n't just dizzy 16.08.2004 -pipe- ballack leads klinsmann 's national team 16.08.2004 -pipe- german defense minister back to work 16.08.2004 -pipe- green minister calls for minimum wage 16.08.2004 -pipe- german film wins silver leopard 13.08.2004 -pipe- eastern germans rally for more protests 13.08.2004 -pipe- german divorce rates reach new high 13.08.2004 -pipe- cologne acts to protect cathedral status 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .
each relief organization makes its own assessment and from that , there ought to be one -lrb- assessment -rrb- that they all can use .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country . " for decades , american armed forces abroad have essentially remained where the wars of the last century ended - in europe and in asia , " bush said . old enemies have disappeared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the us army stationed in germany preparing for a mission to iraq us troops were based in large numbers in germany during the cold war to deter a soviet invasion .
the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country . " for decades , american armed forces abroad have essentially remained where the wars of the last century ended - in europe and in asia , " bush said . old enemies have disappeared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the us army stationed in germany preparing for a mission to iraq us troops were based in large numbers in germany during the cold war to deter a soviet invasion .
the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

after the surrender of the nazis , gis were welcomed by many as liberators .
as the cold war began heating up , more and more us troops were stationed in germany , mostly in the south and southwest of the country . during the 1950s and 1960s , the united states had a presence in more than 500 cities and towns throughout germany , according to phelps .
since 1945 , some 17 million americans have served tours of duty in germany . the long residency has left its stamp , not to mention on those communities with weak industrial bases , for which the nearby us military has become an essential economic engine . the district of birkenfeld is one such area that could be hit hard .

officials have begun doing what they can to convince the americans to stay .

" we 're talking to the us about not just closing the base , but using it differently , perhaps as a training ground . " in fact , authorities are used to talking about conversion , since a substantial cut-back in us force strength has already taken place since the end of the cold war .

the base and the region got a breath of new life when the popular low-cost airline ryanair discovered it and made it its hub in central germany . state officials in rhineland-palatinate can be thankful that two of the largest bases in the region , the ramstein and spangdahlem air bases , are not threatened with closure , even though there could be some troop reduction .
the two make up the largest us military communities outside the united states , and are home to 40,000 soldiers and their dependents .

investors are " concerned that the recovery 's dynamic is weakening because uncertainties about the development of the global economy and the oil price have increase , " zew president wolfgang franz said in a statement , according to bloomberg news service .
it 's a sentiment shared by the officials at germany 's central bank , the bundesbank .
" the desired domestic demand revival could be hampered by further oil price increases , " bank officials wrote in their monthly report released monday .
the high price of oil already lowered exports in june .
exports were mainly responsible for the 2 percent growth germany experienced in the first half of 2004 compared to 2003 .
continuing high prices could create a major problems for germany , europe 's largest economy , experts said .
" the biggest risk for the economy is the oil price , " jonathan hoffman , chief european economist at royal bank of scotland in london told bloomberg news service .

" a $ 10 -lrb- € 8.13 -rrb- per barrel risk premium would raise the german oil bill to $ 27 million -lrb- € 33.21 million -rrb- a day , " credit suisse 's oil expert jeremy baker told the financial times deutschland .
but there is little the organization of petroleum exporting countries -lrb- opec -rrb- can do to lower prices , according to the cartel 's governor , kazempour ardebili .
opec member countries , which are responsible for providing about half the world 's oil exports , are already pumping a 25-year high of 30 million barrels per day .
on monday , oil prices , which have gone up 44 percent this year , reached a new high of $ 46.91 per barrel -lrb- 159 liters -rrb- of us light crude , while a barrel of north sea brent crude also hit a record $ 44.11 in new york and london . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german investors turn away from stocks according to a recent study , the number of german investors owning equities or mutual funds continues to shrink .

horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to kohl 's cdu , is also accused of aiding and abetting the breach of trust . shady transfers of cash the defendants have been charged with moving nearly € 10.6 million -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- in funds from the hesse state branch to secret bank accounts in switzerland and then via liechtenstein back to germany to avoid financial reporting requirements in the 1980s .

however , if the bush administration moves forward with its troop redeployment plans , about half of those soldiers stationed in germany could be leaving . " if they pull out , it would certainly hit us , " gisela paulus , rtt 's manager , told dw-world .
" but it would even be worse for the smaller bus companies who serve other smaller bases around germany .
they would see their numbers cut drastically . " monday 's announcement by us president george w. bush that large numbers of troops will be possibly withdrawn from europe over the next five to six years has serious ramifications for the economies of some german regions around american bases . the bush administration has said it is not " punishing " germany for its continued opposition to the us invasion of iraq , rather it wants to restructure its troop deployment to meet 21st century needs , such as the new threats posed by international terrorism .
the current us alignment here is better equipped to fend off a soviet tank attack . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers in the iraq it is estimated that up to one-half of the 71,000 troops currently in germany could be sent home or redeployed to bases in southern or southeastern europe , closer to hotspots in the middle east .
thousands of military support staff and military families are expected to pack their bags as well . " that has all kinds of repercussions , especially for the economy " dennis phelps of the american-german business club told dw-world .
" there is a whole american infrastructure here - american houses , american schools - when the military pulls out , these things close .
it also means that soldiers are spending money in local shops or paying local landlords rents . " long , strong history since the us entered the country during world war ii , it has been a steady , and mostly appreciated presence in germany .
after the surrender of the nazis , gis were welcomed by many as liberators .
as the cold war began heating up , more and more us troops were stationed in germany , mostly in the south and southwest of the country . during the 1950s and 1960s , the united states had a presence in more than 500 cities and towns throughout germany , according to phelps .
since 1945 , some 17 million americans have served tours of duty in germany . the long residency has left its stamp , not to mention on those communities with weak industrial bases , for which the nearby us military has become an essential economic engine . the district of birkenfeld is one such area that could be hit hard .
up to 20 percent of gdp is dependent on the baumholder military base in the region where parts of the 1st infantry division are now stationed . " a closure could have enormous ramifications for us , " werner knauth , press spokesman for the district , told dw-world . please stay bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration at ramstein air base on march 20 , 2004 against the war in iraq .
despite substantial anger among the german populace at us actions in iraq -lrb- photo -rrb- , and protests at some bases , many germans see the economic considerations outweighing moral ones when it comes to a continuing presence of american troops in the neighborhood .
officials have begun doing what they can to convince the americans to stay . " we 're now in negotiations with the americans , trying to make it appealing for them to stay at their current sites , " said eric schaefer , press spokesman for the interior ministry of rhineland-palatinate , where several bases including baumholder are located .
" we 're talking to the us about not just closing the base , but using it differently , perhaps as a training ground . " in fact , authorities are used to talking about conversion , since a substantial cut-back in us force strength has already taken place since the end of the cold war .
in the mid 1990s , cities such as frankfurt and berlin said good-bye to many of their us troops who were no longer needed after the berlin wall fell and the soviet threat came to an end . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been a few conversion success stories , such as the hahn air base which closed in 1995 .
the base and the region got a breath of new life when the popular low-cost airline ryanair discovered it and made it its hub in central germany . state officials in rhineland-palatinate can be thankful that two of the largest bases in the region , the ramstein and spangdahlem air bases , are not threatened with closure , even though there could be some troop reduction .
the two make up the largest us military communities outside the united states , and are home to 40,000 soldiers and their dependents .
a study by the university of trier showed that the two bases alone contributed about € 1.4 billion -lrb- $ 1.7 billion -rrb- to the local economy in 2001 and support about 27,000 jobs in the region . even though many troops there will stay , local businesses have already begun gearing up for a loss . " things will change , " volker menzel , president of the japanese garden in kaiserslautern , a popular destination for military families near ramstein , told dw-world .

tens of thousands are already dead ; a million displaced persons are in refugee camps or trekking through dangerous territory to reach one with the specter of rape , torture and murder potentially lurking in every patch of parched scrub ; and there 's a real threat of famine and disease . the unfolding events in the hardest hit province of darfur in the west of sudan finally broke into the world 's consciousness in 2004 , after years of simmering intent .
now the numerous relief organizations on the ground work as best they can to help those who are the victims of not only the violence in their country but the inaction of the international community . the task at hand can hardly be underestimated .
while long-term plans are formulated , the organizations do what they can to bring immediate relief to the suffering .
but many face barriers both physical and political in the quest to help . in the fluid and unstable nature of the country they operate in , many have completely different stories to tell , highlighting the paradoxical nature of sudan in crisis . government cooperation the 18-months combined auxiliary program of german aid organizations diakonie kastrophenhilfe and caritas international is currently focused on distributing plastic tarpaulins , covers and mosquito nets as well as promoting hygiene . from the office in nyala , in southern darfur , the joint action team believes 500,000 people can be helped , and gesine wolfinger , spokeswoman for diakonie , is confident that the distribution of aid will go ahead by working closely with the local authorities . " in nyala , one must register as an organization with the humanitarian assistance commission in the presence of officials from the sudanese government .
we have done so and have spoken with a responsible representative of the government in darfur .
the government places a lot of emphasis on cooperation and is keen to allow access to the refugees , " wolfinger told dw-radio . fluid nature of security threatens aid work for others , contacts with the sudanese government are more problematic .
the willingness to cooperate is not always as forthcoming as wolfinger has experienced .
german organization deutschen welthungerhilfe has struggled to cope in the town of kutum in northern darfur , where the population grew from 12,000 to 100,000 people in just a few weeks as wave after wave of refugees headed to this relatively safe enclave . the organization has resources to care for about 90,000 people and has been a well-established and dependable presence in the area since 1998 .
however , its work has suffered by impediments put in its way by the sudanese government . " there are accessible areas in darfur and then there are so-called no-go areas which appear very suddenly .
the areas in which you work can suddenly be barricaded with no more access from outside , " said manfred hochwald , an area leader for programs and projects with deutschen welthungerhilfe , who added that these changing boundaries can be deadly for the people of darfur . " in western darfur , there are areas where nobody has ever entered , neither relief organizations nor representatives of the united nations , hochwald said .
the population figures in that area are between 100,000 people and maybe 500,000 people who can not be reached at all .
and they have nothing .
those who live in the camps in the accessible areas are well cared for .
they can still be supplied at the moment .
but no one can know when the lines will change again . " agencies their own worst enemy at times while the authorities and the war-like situation within the country can hinder the aid operations , some organizations themselves have contributed to the problem of getting in the way of the important work .
there has been criticism within the country that some organizations have come to darfur , completed preliminary studies , promised to return to set up projects but never have come back .
marina peter from sudan focal point europe has heard similar things in southern sudan .
" the people there complain very bitterly that one organization after the other comes and questions them and is never heard from again .
the people feel very used , " she said . peters believes that unawareness of the position on the ground , lack of intercultural knowledge and the poor organization of many agencies are the reasons that the aid effort is not coping with many of darfur 's problems .
the lack of coordination is striking . " the problem is - as is the nature and principle of aid agencies - no one organization is higher than the other .
but that is what relief organizations need .
each relief organization makes its own assessment and from that , there ought to be one -lrb- assessment -rrb- that they all can use .

" it 's staggering that a single german teenager can have such a dramatic influence , " graham cluley of sophos , a company specializing in anti-virus programs , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal computer with virus alert on the screen altogether , sophos experts registered 4,677 new viruses -lrb- which reproduce using a host program -rrb- , worms -lrb- which reproduce without a host program -rrb- and so-called trojans -lrb- which secretly execute other changes to computer programs -rrb- since january . all of these attack programs have short shelf lives and disappear almost as quickly as they emerge . jaschan used security gaps in microsoft 's operating programs windows xp and windows 2000 to spread his programs .
sasser traveled directly from computer to computer and not - as usual - via e-mail attachment ; a simple internet connection was sufficient to infect unprotected computers .
after an attack , the worm immediately started 128 consecutive attacks via the internet or within a local network . good intentions ? but jaschan 's original intention had been to create a " good " worm that would hunt " bad " worms throughout the internet .
his goal was to disarm worms such as mydoom and bagle , which were making their damaging way through the web at the time .
jaschan sent netsky and sasser to infect computers and start " cleaning up " infections from previous worms . the self-proclaimed internet policeman apparently lacked the programming knowledge to prevent harm to computers .
sasser shut down infected systems and restarted them .
jaschan said he had not planned this , but could n't solve the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft headquarters " sasser was meant to be a warning shot , " jaschan said , adding that he was n't a criminal programmer , but rather intended to alert the public to security holes that had to be fixed by microsoft . it 's still unclear how much damage sasser caused - so far , 30 to 40 claims have been submitted , according to jaschan 's defense attorney .
they range from € 45 -lrb- $ 55.5 -rrb- to € 3,500 . suits against jaschan are not likely to reach exorbitant proportions .
but that 's probably not going to influence the computer sabotage criminal case that 's currently pending . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de police call ' sasser ' programmer a bottom-feeding hacker an investigation into the suspected 18-year-old programmer of sasser offers a view of a hacking subculture that poses a serious threat because of its adherents ' inexperience .

" it 's staggering that a single german teenager can have such a dramatic influence , " graham cluley of sophos , a company specializing in anti-virus programs , told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personal computer with virus alert on the screen altogether , sophos experts registered 4,677 new viruses -lrb- which reproduce using a host program -rrb- , worms -lrb- which reproduce without a host program -rrb- and so-called trojans -lrb- which secretly execute other changes to computer programs -rrb- since january . all of these attack programs have short shelf lives and disappear almost as quickly as they emerge . jaschan used security gaps in microsoft 's operating programs windows xp and windows 2000 to spread his programs .
sasser traveled directly from computer to computer and not - as usual - via e-mail attachment ; a simple internet connection was sufficient to infect unprotected computers .
after an attack , the worm immediately started 128 consecutive attacks via the internet or within a local network . good intentions ? but jaschan 's original intention had been to create a " good " worm that would hunt " bad " worms throughout the internet .
his goal was to disarm worms such as mydoom and bagle , which were making their damaging way through the web at the time .
jaschan sent netsky and sasser to infect computers and start " cleaning up " infections from previous worms . the self-proclaimed internet policeman apparently lacked the programming knowledge to prevent harm to computers .
sasser shut down infected systems and restarted them .
jaschan said he had not planned this , but could n't solve the problem . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : microsoft headquarters " sasser was meant to be a warning shot , " jaschan said , adding that he was n't a criminal programmer , but rather intended to alert the public to security holes that had to be fixed by microsoft . it 's still unclear how much damage sasser caused - so far , 30 to 40 claims have been submitted , according to jaschan 's defense attorney .
they range from € 45 -lrb- $ 55.5 -rrb- to € 3,500 . suits against jaschan are not likely to reach exorbitant proportions .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country . " for decades , american armed forces abroad have essentially remained where the wars of the last century ended - in europe and in asia , " bush said . old enemies have disappeared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the us army stationed in germany preparing for a mission to iraq us troops were based in large numbers in germany during the cold war to deter a soviet invasion .
the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

but many are shoddy businesses seeking to make a quick euro .
one national group is trying to set high standards for the industry . the idea that the body needs to be kept in good shape is n't a notion held exclusively by modern olympic athletes - it 's a concept that was shared by sport heroes in ancient times , too .
for the past several years , stressed-out people in germany have begun to better appreciate their bodies .
" wellness " is the word du jour here nowadays .
but what 's behind this new wave of contentedness ?
is the wellness movement really something that helps improve people 's lives or is it just a fashionable trend with little actual effect ?
first created about a decade ago , the term wellness started in the united states as a way of combining the concepts of fitness and well-being .
wellness leaps the big pond the american pioneers of the wellness movement were seeking to sink the health care costs - and not without reason .
our contemporary lifestyles have become the cause of a number of illnesses .
indeed , everyone has a personal responsibility to improve his or her health and well-being .
gradually , the wellness movement began to make its way over to europe , becoming a more important part of people 's leisure activities .
but many pursued it as a hobby rather than for reasons of health .
that 's something the german wellness association , founded in 1997 , is seeking to change .
a loose configuration of psychologists , sports medicine practitioners and nutritionists have joined forces to promote the concept that health and pleasure are not mutually exclusive concepts .

busch knows what he 's talking about .

" there are approximately 1,000 wellness hotels in germany or hotels that call themselves that , " said busch .
" according to our research and our quality criteria , only one-fifth of these hotels even deserve to use the word ' wellness ' to describe what they offer . "
a few years back , his organization began a voluntary certification program that allows hotels to be certified if they are willing to undergo unscheduled spot checks .
the program examines hotels based on over 1,000 criteria that are then analyzed in order to grade the quality of the hotel .
if a hotel meets sufficient criteria , the association issues it a certificate of approval .
if it does n't pass the test , the hotel receives a report indicating where it needs improvement .
so how stringent are the association 's criteria ?
so far , not a single hotel in the cologne metropolitan region has been bestowed with one of its logos .
in order to be able to place the respected decal in their window , a hotel needs more than just a name , busch says , it needs a comprehensive wellness program .

some of them are expected to be moved to posts in eastern europe while others will return home . poland and turkey have been named as possible locations for additional troops .
others are to be based in the us , available for deployments overseas .
bush made the announcement while addressing the veterans of foreign wars convention in cincinnati . " for the coming decade , we 'll deploy a more agile and more flexible force , which means that more of our troops will be stationed and deployed from here at home , " he said .
" we 'll move some of our troops and capabilities to new locations so they can surge quickly to respond to unexpected threats . " with these words us president george w. bush has set in motion one of the largest troop realignments since the end of the cold war .
and , indeed , bush cited the cessation of soviet-era hostilities as the primary reason for an action which will have far-reaching implications not only for the us , but for major allies around the world , including germany .
around 70,000 us troops are stationed in military bases across this country . " for decades , american armed forces abroad have essentially remained where the wars of the last century ended - in europe and in asia , " bush said . old enemies have disappeared bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of the us army stationed in germany preparing for a mission to iraq us troops were based in large numbers in germany during the cold war to deter a soviet invasion .
the us will also reduce troop numbers in south korea , where they have held static positions for 50 years . though old enemy no longer exists , newer and perhaps more unpredictable ones appear to be emerging all the time .
the realignment follows years of debate over how to respond to modern-day threats , such as terrorism and unrest in the middle east .
and the question of where the troops should be positioned to best execute their present and future missions inevitably followed . " we 'll take advantage of 21st century military technologies to rapidly deploy increased combat power , " bush said .
" the new plan will help us fight and win these wars of the 21st century .
it will strengthen our alliances around the world while we build new partnerships to better preserve the peace . " more flexibility us defence secretary donald rumsfeld had already said he wanted troops to be based more flexibly so they could be deployed for a variety of missions , rather than being tied down to a single country .
bush said he was bringing thousands of soldiers and other personnel back home in the interest of their family life as well . " the world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it for the sake of our military families , for the sake of our taxpayers , and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace , " bush said . while the plan is bound to get bush more election-year applause , not least from families of military personnel , some analysts say it wo n't ease the strain on some 150,000 soldiers deployed to war zones in iraq and afghanistan . u.s. armed forces stationed elsewhere around the world number around 200,000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.08.2004 thousands rally in germany against welfare cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organizers said more than 90,000 people demonstrated monday tens of thousands of people hit the streets of several german cities monday to protest looming cuts in unemployment benefits , continuing a series of weekly protests against government reforms . police said 15,000 protestors marched to the headquarters of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- in central berlin in a noisy but peaceful protest against the biggest overhaul of germany 's generous welfare system in decades .
in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .
for the second monday running protest action is planned across the country .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .
the only difference is that the demonstrations in the west are being organized by anti-globalization activists , the successor party to the east german communists , the pds , and not by those directly affected by the welfare cuts - the unemployed . nigel tandy -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de back to the streets for anti-reform germans the german government 's concessions to its planned employment market reforms have done little to change the frustrated mood among the public .

the bank earned € 129 million -lrb- $ 159.1 million -rrb- and will remain on an upward course , according to the head of the bank 's board of directors , herbert walter , who said profits will triple in the foreseeable future .
gains at dresdner bank , however , could not help munich-based allianz , europe 's largest financial services company of which the dresdner bank is a division , return to profitability .
with net income down from € 662 million a year ago to € 614 million , second quarter earnings fell 7.2 percent .
the dresdner bank , which was purchased by allianz in 2001 , achieved its turnaround after allianz chief executive officer michael diekmann cut 4,700 jobs and shed bad loans .
analysts expect top allianz executives will now turn their attention to implementing similar measures company-wide in an effort to achieve similar ends . more briefs 16.08.2004 -pipe- study : german firms moving out of country 16.08.2004 -pipe- german industrial output increases 16.08.2004 -pipe- expert : social reforms will save € 10 billion 16.08.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn lowers operating losses 13.08.2004 -pipe- germany to issue libya export guarantees 13.08.2004 -pipe- newspaper : vultures funds want tui 13.08.2004 -pipe- passenger numbers up at frankfurt 12.08.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler managers accept pay cuts 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

11 terror cell großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motassadeq claims he knew nothing about the terror plans a moroccan on trial in germany for suspected involvement in the sept .
11 attacks was a member of a radical group that believed " something had to be done against america , " a witness testified tuesday . the testimony came just days after us authorities had released transcripts of interviews with ramzi binalshibh , the alleged organizer of the sept .
11 attacks .
binalshibh had exonerated mounir el motassadeq , saying that the moroccan had no knowledge of the terror plans . but on tuesday , shahid nickels , a 23-year-old german student , said motassadeq belonged to the inner circle of a radical group promoting attacks against the us and israel . nickels said he met motassadeq and the others in 1997 at hamburg 's radical al-quds mosque , where he attended a quran study class led by mohammed atta , the alleged leader of the attacks , ap news agency reported . according to nickels , the group believed that " israel did n't have the right to statehood and suicide attacks were legitimate .
in america , they believed that the jews had a lot of power . " he said that by late 1999 , the group 's conversations were " all about jihad . " " they said that something had to be done against america , " said nickels , the first of more than 30 witnesses scheduled to appear at the trial , according to ap . motassadeq is on retrial after a german appeals court overturned a 2003 conviction in an earlier trial .
he had been serving a 15-year sentence for his involvement in the attacks , but was released from prison in april pending his retrial . nickels ' testimony during the first trial had played a crucial role in convicting motassadeq .
on tuesday , he said that he distanced himself from the group .

to make their point , they spread out 11,000 dead fish on a 100 meter-long table in front of the brandenburg gate .
the fish were caught during a single two-hour commercial fishing expedition in the north sea last week , but sorted out and thrown away as " trash " by the fishermen because they were considered unsuitable for sale .
the discarded fish were later picked up by the greenpeace boat " esperanza " and brought to berlin for the protest .
according to thomas henningsen , a marine biologist for greenpeace , more than 700,000 fish are needlessly killed in such a manner every year and the practice should come to an end .

in demonstrations in several eastern cities , organizers said 15,000 people marched in magdeburg and another 25,000 in leipzig , while in halle , 5,000 took to the streets . the monday demonstrations have a tradition in the former communist east .
leipzig ’ s nikolai church was in 1989 , as it is now , the starting point and symbol for a series of demonstrations that eventually led to the downfall of erich honeckers communist regime . such was the outrage against schröder ’ s planned reforms that the social democrat leader ordered ministers back from vacation for an emergency cabinet session to water down the law , dubbed " hartz iv " after volkswagen executive peter hartz , who headed a special commission to revamp the jobs market .
" we are the people " on monday the demonstrators were back on the street , supported by anti-globalization protesters in more than 90 cities . protesters waved banners which read : " we are the people - not slaves to hartz iv . " by giving in to protests early the government might be blamed for fuelling more widespread demonstrations against the bill , which slashes payments for the long-term unemployed and introduces means testing for the first time in germany . " the protests will continue ... we want to get rid of hartz iv , " andreas erholdt , organizer of the first demonstrations in the eastern german city of magdeburg , told dw-radio . " we don ’ t want to get rid of any politicians or political parties but we ’ ve got no alternative .
we say hartz iv can come , but only if that means more work for us . " economics and labor minister wolfgang clement , a staunch supporter of reform , has strongly criticized the demonstrations and insisted they would not influence the government . the comparison to the leipzig monday demonstrations in 1989 , he said , was an insult to those who demonstrated against the injustices of the former german democratic republic .
little action in the west meanwhile in the west they are singing to a different tune .
in contrast to the former communist east only a few hundred demonstrators joined the marches in western germany . but with unemployment running at more than 18 percent in some cities in the ruhr valley , the west 's former industrial heartland , in cities like gelsenkirchen , duisburg and dortmund , the people there are experiencing the same kind of hardship as those in the east .

horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to kohl 's cdu , is also accused of aiding and abetting the breach of trust . shady transfers of cash the defendants have been charged with moving nearly € 10.6 million -lrb- $ 13.3 million -rrb- in funds from the hesse state branch to secret bank accounts in switzerland and then via liechtenstein back to germany to avoid financial reporting requirements in the 1980s .
the money is said to have been used to fund election campaigns between the end of 1982 and january 2000 without the knowledge of the party 's executive , wiesbaden prosecutor 's spokesman klaus schulte said in an interview . " they neither harmed the party nor privately enriched themselves , but depriving those responsible within the party of the power to dispose of the money is also considered a crime , " schulte said in the opening statement .
the offense carries a prison term of up to five years , he said . kohl got sleaze ball rolling in 1999 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl the scandal really exploded in 1999 , when kohl admitted in december of that year , 12 months after he and his party lost power , that he had accepted around € 1 million in cash from unidentified donors .
he has refused to name the donors ever since , but has vehemently denied that decisions by his government were bought during his 16 years in power . the scandal spread when wolfgang schäuble took over as cdu party chairman after kohl quit , only to resign a few weeks later over other cash donations that were n't registered in the party 's accounts as required by law . administration under investigation then , in 2001 , the wiesbaden prosecutor brought charges related to the cdu 's funds in the state of hesse against kanther , who headed the cdu hesse branch and was state finance minister between 1987 and 1991 .
the court 's economic panel ruled that the statute of limitations applied as the money had been transferred to switzerland more than five years earlier , schulte said . the frankfurt higher regional court then overturned that ruling after the prosecutor appealed , arguing that the five-year limitation should only apply from the time the money was brought back to germany . the trial is scheduled to last until december , with hesse 's christian democratic premier , roland koch , among witnesses scheduled to appear . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de controversy over kohl 's stasi files continues files compiled by the former east german secret service -lrb- stasi -rrb- on former german chancellor helmut kohl could become public despite a recent court ruling imposing major restrictions on their publication .

the bank earned € 129 million -lrb- $ 159.1 million -rrb- and will remain on an upward course , according to the head of the bank 's board of directors , herbert walter , who said profits will triple in the foreseeable future .
gains at dresdner bank , however , could not help munich-based allianz , europe 's largest financial services company of which the dresdner bank is a division , return to profitability .
with net income down from € 662 million a year ago to € 614 million , second quarter earnings fell 7.2 percent .
the dresdner bank , which was purchased by allianz in 2001 , achieved its turnaround after allianz chief executive officer michael diekmann cut 4,700 jobs and shed bad loans .
analysts expect top allianz executives will now turn their attention to implementing similar measures company-wide in an effort to achieve similar ends . more briefs 16.08.2004 -pipe- study : german firms moving out of country 16.08.2004 -pipe- german industrial output increases 16.08.2004 -pipe- expert : social reforms will save € 10 billion 16.08.2004 -pipe- deutsche bahn lowers operating losses 13.08.2004 -pipe- germany to issue libya export guarantees 13.08.2004 -pipe- newspaper : vultures funds want tui 13.08.2004 -pipe- passenger numbers up at frankfurt 12.08.2004 -pipe- daimlerchrysler managers accept pay cuts radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .
