there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .
the worker 's party will get three seats in parliament , with the remaining two going to the nationalists .
voter turnout in malta was far greater than in other eu states , with 82 percent of citizens casting ballots .
incumbent governments were also punished by voters in ireland , latvia and the netherlands .
in the eu 's largest new member state , poland , polls showed the governing left party gaining just 11 percent of the vote , with exceptionally low voter turnout of 30 percent .
but greece 's conservative government bucked what otherwise appeared to be a trend by gaining voters .
prime minister costas karamanlis 's new democracy party scored 42.5 percent of the votes , close to 10 percentage points more than the opposition socialist pasok party .
in austria , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- were in a head-to-head race with the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- , led by chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
övp 's junior coalition party , the right-wing populist freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- appeared on course for a dramatic fall - from 23 to only 6 percent .
the day 's big surprise in austria , however , was hans-peter martin , an independent member of parliament and anti-corruption campaigner who won 14 percent of the votes and two seats for his list of independent candidates .
in may , martin created waves after accusing his colleagues in parliament of padding their expense reports and committing petty fraud .
on the mediterranean island of cyprus , the left-leaning akel party appeared on track to become the country 's strongest party in the european parliament .
cypriot broadcaster rik reported that the party was on track to win 29 percent of the votes and two of the country 's seats in parliament .
meanwhile , the opposition right-wing disy was on track to get 25 percent of the vote and two seats in strasbourg .
despite cypriot law requiring all eligible citizens to vote , turnout also appeared relatively low .
three months after its domestic parliamentary victors , spain 's socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by prime minister josé rodriguez zapatero , also appeared on course to become the most powerful spanish party in strasbourg .
a message from voters citizens across europe this week used the european election as an opportunity to send a warning vote to their national governments .
in britain , denmark , the czech republic and other eu states , governing parties lost a considerable number of voters and seats to either the opposition or euroskeptical parties .
in many places , critics of european unity were on an ascendant course , like in britain , where the anti-eu uk independence party scored a major upset .
low turnout voter apathy proved to be another uncomfortable trend .
despite the membership of 10 new states in the eu , a total of less than 45 percent of european voters made their voices be heard . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats suffer double defeat exit polls on sunday showed german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats taking a drubbing in elections for the european parliament .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .
annual show of pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day parade in cologne , july 6 , 2003 .
next year 's europride will take place in oslo , norway .
in contrast to germany , where numerous csd parades take place throughout the summer , the scandinavian country has expressed concern over hosting the event .
the lutheran mission , a division of norway 's state lutheran church , has protested holding the celebration out of fear the city would become a magnet for gays .
the lutheran mission , which aims to spread the word of the bible at home and abroad , sees homosexuality in stark contrast to christian sexual morals which are based on marriage and fidelity .
for the organizers of europride , opposition to the event from the religious community is little reason for concern .
norway , like other northern european countries , has a liberal political approach to homosexuality . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when turkish men love men homosexuality is taboo in turkey .

on average , only 44.6 percent of eligible european voters turned up at their local polling stations to vote for the members of parliament who will represent their countries .
though no single trend marked the election , in a number of countries voters punished incumbent governments for everything from social system reforms to iraq war policies .
other elections were clouded by low voter turnout .
despite their newfound membership in the eu , many eastern europeans shied away from the pools .
while 47.7 percent of registered voters in the original eu member states cast ballots sunday , a meager 28.7 percent of voters in the new member states participated in the election .
bildunterschrift : preliminary results early results in germany showed the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , leading with about 45 percent .
though the parties registered slight losses over 1999 , they still managed to gain almost half of germany 's seats in parliament - more than double that of the social democrats .
leading opposition politicians declared sunday that new federal parliamentary elections for the bundestag should be held in the wake of the decisive european vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : division of parliamentary seats voters on sunday dealt the governing social democratic party a serious blow , reducing its mandate in parliament by 9.3 percent drop to 21 percent .

the party of social democracy , the successor to east germany 's communist party , also gained 0.4 percent , or 6.2 percent of the vote .
bildunterschrift : election gains and lasses the success of germany 's conservative christian democrats was mirrored across europe , with its strasbourg counterpart , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- gaining the largest number of seats in parliament .
a gallup poll showed epp winning between 247 and 277 of parliaments total 732 seats .
but the social democrats , were only expected to win 189 to 209 seats .
the liberals are expected to win third place , with the greens and socialists following .
in the last european election in 1999 , the epp also gained the biggest number of seats .
head-to-head race in austria elsewhere in europe , early results also trickled out sunday evening .
in france , the opposition socialists won a decisive victory over the political camp of french president jacques chirac .
election night exit polls showed the socialists gaining 8 points , with a total of 30 percent of the votes .
chirac 's conservative union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- scored 16.5 percent of the votes and the center-right union for french democracy attracted about 12 percent of voters - a marked turnaround from the parties ' domestic electoral triumph in 2002 .
critical brits in great britain , euroskeptics scored a triumphant victory .
the once marginal uk independence party , which has called on britain to leave the eu , won 18 percent of the vote , drawing many voters from the conservative tories .
the british voted on thursday night , with the governing labor party chalking up major losses .
tony blair 's labor lost a total of 6 points , gaining just 22 percent of the votes .
but the tories fared even worse , falling 14 percentage points to 22 percent .
opposition gains in czech republic exit polls in the czech republic released on saturday night showed a dismal 10.5 percent result for the governing social democrats , whereas the euroskeptic ods party of president vaclav havel was set to gain 31 percent of voters .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .
chancellor schröder could then come out on top in 2006 . grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .
annual show of pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day parade in cologne , july 6 , 2003 .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .

despite their newfound membership in the eu , many eastern europeans shied away from the pools .
while 47.7 percent of registered voters in the original eu member states cast ballots sunday , a meager 28.7 percent of voters in the new member states participated in the election .

but the social democrats , were only expected to win 189 to 209 seats .
the liberals are expected to win third place , with the greens and socialists following .

the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .

drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .

but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .

germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.06.2004 eu elections test german government 's stamina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 24 parties compete for 99 seats in germany 's eu parliamentary bloc .
germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .
the worker 's party will get three seats in parliament , with the remaining two going to the nationalists .
voter turnout in malta was far greater than in other eu states , with 82 percent of citizens casting ballots .
incumbent governments were also punished by voters in ireland , latvia and the netherlands .
in the eu 's largest new member state , poland , polls showed the governing left party gaining just 11 percent of the vote , with exceptionally low voter turnout of 30 percent .

prime minister costas karamanlis 's new democracy party scored 42.5 percent of the votes , close to 10 percentage points more than the opposition socialist pasok party .

there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .
the worker 's party will get three seats in parliament , with the remaining two going to the nationalists .
voter turnout in malta was far greater than in other eu states , with 82 percent of citizens casting ballots .
incumbent governments were also punished by voters in ireland , latvia and the netherlands .
in the eu 's largest new member state , poland , polls showed the governing left party gaining just 11 percent of the vote , with exceptionally low voter turnout of 30 percent .
but greece 's conservative government bucked what otherwise appeared to be a trend by gaining voters .
prime minister costas karamanlis 's new democracy party scored 42.5 percent of the votes , close to 10 percentage points more than the opposition socialist pasok party .
in austria , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- were in a head-to-head race with the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- , led by chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
övp 's junior coalition party , the right-wing populist freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- appeared on course for a dramatic fall - from 23 to only 6 percent .
the day 's big surprise in austria , however , was hans-peter martin , an independent member of parliament and anti-corruption campaigner who won 14 percent of the votes and two seats for his list of independent candidates .
in may , martin created waves after accusing his colleagues in parliament of padding their expense reports and committing petty fraud .
on the mediterranean island of cyprus , the left-leaning akel party appeared on track to become the country 's strongest party in the european parliament .
cypriot broadcaster rik reported that the party was on track to win 29 percent of the votes and two of the country 's seats in parliament .
meanwhile , the opposition right-wing disy was on track to get 25 percent of the vote and two seats in strasbourg .
despite cypriot law requiring all eligible citizens to vote , turnout also appeared relatively low .
three months after its domestic parliamentary victors , spain 's socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by prime minister josé rodriguez zapatero , also appeared on course to become the most powerful spanish party in strasbourg .
a message from voters citizens across europe this week used the european election as an opportunity to send a warning vote to their national governments .
in britain , denmark , the czech republic and other eu states , governing parties lost a considerable number of voters and seats to either the opposition or euroskeptical parties .
in many places , critics of european unity were on an ascendant course , like in britain , where the anti-eu uk independence party scored a major upset .
low turnout voter apathy proved to be another uncomfortable trend .
despite the membership of 10 new states in the eu , a total of less than 45 percent of european voters made their voices be heard . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats suffer double defeat exit polls on sunday showed german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats taking a drubbing in elections for the european parliament .

germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.06.2004 eu elections test german government 's stamina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 24 parties compete for 99 seats in germany 's eu parliamentary bloc .
germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .
this was the case the last time europeans elected their parliament in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : eu campaigns are just window-dressing candidates are in top gear throughout the eu , stumping for election to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .
chancellor schröder could then come out on top in 2006 . grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.06.2004 eu elections test german government 's stamina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 24 parties compete for 99 seats in germany 's eu parliamentary bloc .
germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .
annual show of pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day parade in cologne , july 6 , 2003 .
next year 's europride will take place in oslo , norway .
in contrast to germany , where numerous csd parades take place throughout the summer , the scandinavian country has expressed concern over hosting the event .
the lutheran mission , a division of norway 's state lutheran church , has protested holding the celebration out of fear the city would become a magnet for gays .
the lutheran mission , which aims to spread the word of the bible at home and abroad , sees homosexuality in stark contrast to christian sexual morals which are based on marriage and fidelity .
for the organizers of europride , opposition to the event from the religious community is little reason for concern .

under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .

next year 's europride will take place in oslo , norway .
in contrast to germany , where numerous csd parades take place throughout the summer , the scandinavian country has expressed concern over hosting the event .
the lutheran mission , a division of norway 's state lutheran church , has protested holding the celebration out of fear the city would become a magnet for gays .
the lutheran mission , which aims to spread the word of the bible at home and abroad , sees homosexuality in stark contrast to christian sexual morals which are based on marriage and fidelity .
for the organizers of europride , opposition to the event from the religious community is little reason for concern .
norway , like other northern european countries , has a liberal political approach to homosexuality . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when turkish men love men homosexuality is taboo in turkey .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .
the worker 's party will get three seats in parliament , with the remaining two going to the nationalists .
voter turnout in malta was far greater than in other eu states , with 82 percent of citizens casting ballots .
incumbent governments were also punished by voters in ireland , latvia and the netherlands .

there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .
the worker 's party will get three seats in parliament , with the remaining two going to the nationalists .
voter turnout in malta was far greater than in other eu states , with 82 percent of citizens casting ballots .
incumbent governments were also punished by voters in ireland , latvia and the netherlands .
in the eu 's largest new member state , poland , polls showed the governing left party gaining just 11 percent of the vote , with exceptionally low voter turnout of 30 percent .
but greece 's conservative government bucked what otherwise appeared to be a trend by gaining voters .
prime minister costas karamanlis 's new democracy party scored 42.5 percent of the votes , close to 10 percentage points more than the opposition socialist pasok party .
in austria , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- were in a head-to-head race with the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- , led by chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
övp 's junior coalition party , the right-wing populist freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- appeared on course for a dramatic fall - from 23 to only 6 percent .
the day 's big surprise in austria , however , was hans-peter martin , an independent member of parliament and anti-corruption campaigner who won 14 percent of the votes and two seats for his list of independent candidates .
in may , martin created waves after accusing his colleagues in parliament of padding their expense reports and committing petty fraud .

meanwhile , the opposition right-wing disy was on track to get 25 percent of the vote and two seats in strasbourg .
despite cypriot law requiring all eligible citizens to vote , turnout also appeared relatively low .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .

the lutheran mission , a division of norway 's state lutheran church , has protested holding the celebration out of fear the city would become a magnet for gays .
the lutheran mission , which aims to spread the word of the bible at home and abroad , sees homosexuality in stark contrast to christian sexual morals which are based on marriage and fidelity .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .
annual show of pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day parade in cologne , july 6 , 2003 .
next year 's europride will take place in oslo , norway .
in contrast to germany , where numerous csd parades take place throughout the summer , the scandinavian country has expressed concern over hosting the event .
the lutheran mission , a division of norway 's state lutheran church , has protested holding the celebration out of fear the city would become a magnet for gays .
the lutheran mission , which aims to spread the word of the bible at home and abroad , sees homosexuality in stark contrast to christian sexual morals which are based on marriage and fidelity .
for the organizers of europride , opposition to the event from the religious community is little reason for concern .
norway , like other northern european countries , has a liberal political approach to homosexuality . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when turkish men love men homosexuality is taboo in turkey .

germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .

germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .
annual show of pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day parade in cologne , july 6 , 2003 .
next year 's europride will take place in oslo , norway .
in contrast to germany , where numerous csd parades take place throughout the summer , the scandinavian country has expressed concern over hosting the event .
the lutheran mission , a division of norway 's state lutheran church , has protested holding the celebration out of fear the city would become a magnet for gays .
the lutheran mission , which aims to spread the word of the bible at home and abroad , sees homosexuality in stark contrast to christian sexual morals which are based on marriage and fidelity .
for the organizers of europride , opposition to the event from the religious community is little reason for concern .
norway , like other northern european countries , has a liberal political approach to homosexuality . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when turkish men love men homosexuality is taboo in turkey .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.06.2004 eu elections test german government 's stamina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 24 parties compete for 99 seats in germany 's eu parliamentary bloc .
germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .

on average , only 44.6 percent of eligible european voters turned up at their local polling stations to vote for the members of parliament who will represent their countries .
though no single trend marked the election , in a number of countries voters punished incumbent governments for everything from social system reforms to iraq war policies .
other elections were clouded by low voter turnout .
despite their newfound membership in the eu , many eastern europeans shied away from the pools .
while 47.7 percent of registered voters in the original eu member states cast ballots sunday , a meager 28.7 percent of voters in the new member states participated in the election .
bildunterschrift : preliminary results early results in germany showed the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , leading with about 45 percent .
though the parties registered slight losses over 1999 , they still managed to gain almost half of germany 's seats in parliament - more than double that of the social democrats .
leading opposition politicians declared sunday that new federal parliamentary elections for the bundestag should be held in the wake of the decisive european vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : division of parliamentary seats voters on sunday dealt the governing social democratic party a serious blow , reducing its mandate in parliament by 9.3 percent drop to 21 percent .
the greens , the junior government coalition partner , racked up a gain of 5.4 percent , with 11.8 percent of the voters , and the business-friendly free democratic party gained 3 percent , attracting 6 percent of the votes .
the party of social democracy , the successor to east germany 's communist party , also gained 0.4 percent , or 6.2 percent of the vote .
bildunterschrift : election gains and lasses the success of germany 's conservative christian democrats was mirrored across europe , with its strasbourg counterpart , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- gaining the largest number of seats in parliament .
a gallup poll showed epp winning between 247 and 277 of parliaments total 732 seats .
but the social democrats , were only expected to win 189 to 209 seats .
the liberals are expected to win third place , with the greens and socialists following .
in the last european election in 1999 , the epp also gained the biggest number of seats .
head-to-head race in austria elsewhere in europe , early results also trickled out sunday evening .
in france , the opposition socialists won a decisive victory over the political camp of french president jacques chirac .
election night exit polls showed the socialists gaining 8 points , with a total of 30 percent of the votes .
chirac 's conservative union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- scored 16.5 percent of the votes and the center-right union for french democracy attracted about 12 percent of voters - a marked turnaround from the parties ' domestic electoral triumph in 2002 .
critical brits in great britain , euroskeptics scored a triumphant victory .
the once marginal uk independence party , which has called on britain to leave the eu , won 18 percent of the vote , drawing many voters from the conservative tories .
the british voted on thursday night , with the governing labor party chalking up major losses .
tony blair 's labor lost a total of 6 points , gaining just 22 percent of the votes .
but the tories fared even worse , falling 14 percentage points to 22 percent .
opposition gains in czech republic exit polls in the czech republic released on saturday night showed a dismal 10.5 percent result for the governing social democrats , whereas the euroskeptic ods party of president vaclav havel was set to gain 31 percent of voters .

on average , only 44.6 percent of eligible european voters turned up at their local polling stations to vote for the members of parliament who will represent their countries .
though no single trend marked the election , in a number of countries voters punished incumbent governments for everything from social system reforms to iraq war policies .
other elections were clouded by low voter turnout .
despite their newfound membership in the eu , many eastern europeans shied away from the pools .
while 47.7 percent of registered voters in the original eu member states cast ballots sunday , a meager 28.7 percent of voters in the new member states participated in the election .
bildunterschrift : preliminary results early results in germany showed the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , leading with about 45 percent .
though the parties registered slight losses over 1999 , they still managed to gain almost half of germany 's seats in parliament - more than double that of the social democrats .
leading opposition politicians declared sunday that new federal parliamentary elections for the bundestag should be held in the wake of the decisive european vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : division of parliamentary seats voters on sunday dealt the governing social democratic party a serious blow , reducing its mandate in parliament by 9.3 percent drop to 21 percent .
the greens , the junior government coalition partner , racked up a gain of 5.4 percent , with 11.8 percent of the voters , and the business-friendly free democratic party gained 3 percent , attracting 6 percent of the votes .
the party of social democracy , the successor to east germany 's communist party , also gained 0.4 percent , or 6.2 percent of the vote .
bildunterschrift : election gains and lasses the success of germany 's conservative christian democrats was mirrored across europe , with its strasbourg counterpart , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- gaining the largest number of seats in parliament .
a gallup poll showed epp winning between 247 and 277 of parliaments total 732 seats .
but the social democrats , were only expected to win 189 to 209 seats .
the liberals are expected to win third place , with the greens and socialists following .
in the last european election in 1999 , the epp also gained the biggest number of seats .
head-to-head race in austria elsewhere in europe , early results also trickled out sunday evening .
in france , the opposition socialists won a decisive victory over the political camp of french president jacques chirac .
election night exit polls showed the socialists gaining 8 points , with a total of 30 percent of the votes .
chirac 's conservative union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- scored 16.5 percent of the votes and the center-right union for french democracy attracted about 12 percent of voters - a marked turnaround from the parties ' domestic electoral triumph in 2002 .
critical brits in great britain , euroskeptics scored a triumphant victory .
the once marginal uk independence party , which has called on britain to leave the eu , won 18 percent of the vote , drawing many voters from the conservative tories .
the british voted on thursday night , with the governing labor party chalking up major losses .
tony blair 's labor lost a total of 6 points , gaining just 22 percent of the votes .
but the tories fared even worse , falling 14 percentage points to 22 percent .
opposition gains in czech republic exit polls in the czech republic released on saturday night showed a dismal 10.5 percent result for the governing social democrats , whereas the euroskeptic ods party of president vaclav havel was set to gain 31 percent of voters .
the dramatically anti-european kscm party , meanwhile , was expected to score 17 percent of the votes . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats suffer double defeat exit polls on sunday showed german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats taking a drubbing in elections for the european parliament .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .
chancellor schröder could then come out on top in 2006 . grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2004 conservatives win european elections back to first page back 2/2 in denmark , exit polls showed the opposition social democrats winning the european election .
there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .
the worker 's party will get three seats in parliament , with the remaining two going to the nationalists .
voter turnout in malta was far greater than in other eu states , with 82 percent of citizens casting ballots .
incumbent governments were also punished by voters in ireland , latvia and the netherlands .
in the eu 's largest new member state , poland , polls showed the governing left party gaining just 11 percent of the vote , with exceptionally low voter turnout of 30 percent .
but greece 's conservative government bucked what otherwise appeared to be a trend by gaining voters .
prime minister costas karamanlis 's new democracy party scored 42.5 percent of the votes , close to 10 percentage points more than the opposition socialist pasok party .
in austria , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- were in a head-to-head race with the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- , led by chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
övp 's junior coalition party , the right-wing populist freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- appeared on course for a dramatic fall - from 23 to only 6 percent .
the day 's big surprise in austria , however , was hans-peter martin , an independent member of parliament and anti-corruption campaigner who won 14 percent of the votes and two seats for his list of independent candidates .
in may , martin created waves after accusing his colleagues in parliament of padding their expense reports and committing petty fraud .
on the mediterranean island of cyprus , the left-leaning akel party appeared on track to become the country 's strongest party in the european parliament .
cypriot broadcaster rik reported that the party was on track to win 29 percent of the votes and two of the country 's seats in parliament .
meanwhile , the opposition right-wing disy was on track to get 25 percent of the vote and two seats in strasbourg .
despite cypriot law requiring all eligible citizens to vote , turnout also appeared relatively low .
three months after its domestic parliamentary victors , spain 's socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by prime minister josé rodriguez zapatero , also appeared on course to become the most powerful spanish party in strasbourg .
a message from voters citizens across europe this week used the european election as an opportunity to send a warning vote to their national governments .
in britain , denmark , the czech republic and other eu states , governing parties lost a considerable number of voters and seats to either the opposition or euroskeptical parties .
in many places , critics of european unity were on an ascendant course , like in britain , where the anti-eu uk independence party scored a major upset .
low turnout voter apathy proved to be another uncomfortable trend .
despite the membership of 10 new states in the eu , a total of less than 45 percent of european voters made their voices be heard . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats suffer double defeat exit polls on sunday showed german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats taking a drubbing in elections for the european parliament .

of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .

this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .

in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .

there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .
the worker 's party will get three seats in parliament , with the remaining two going to the nationalists .
voter turnout in malta was far greater than in other eu states , with 82 percent of citizens casting ballots .
incumbent governments were also punished by voters in ireland , latvia and the netherlands .
in the eu 's largest new member state , poland , polls showed the governing left party gaining just 11 percent of the vote , with exceptionally low voter turnout of 30 percent .
but greece 's conservative government bucked what otherwise appeared to be a trend by gaining voters .
prime minister costas karamanlis 's new democracy party scored 42.5 percent of the votes , close to 10 percentage points more than the opposition socialist pasok party .
in austria , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- were in a head-to-head race with the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- , led by chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
övp 's junior coalition party , the right-wing populist freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- appeared on course for a dramatic fall - from 23 to only 6 percent .
the day 's big surprise in austria , however , was hans-peter martin , an independent member of parliament and anti-corruption campaigner who won 14 percent of the votes and two seats for his list of independent candidates .
in may , martin created waves after accusing his colleagues in parliament of padding their expense reports and committing petty fraud .
on the mediterranean island of cyprus , the left-leaning akel party appeared on track to become the country 's strongest party in the european parliament .
cypriot broadcaster rik reported that the party was on track to win 29 percent of the votes and two of the country 's seats in parliament .
meanwhile , the opposition right-wing disy was on track to get 25 percent of the vote and two seats in strasbourg .
despite cypriot law requiring all eligible citizens to vote , turnout also appeared relatively low .
three months after its domestic parliamentary victors , spain 's socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by prime minister josé rodriguez zapatero , also appeared on course to become the most powerful spanish party in strasbourg .
a message from voters citizens across europe this week used the european election as an opportunity to send a warning vote to their national governments .
in britain , denmark , the czech republic and other eu states , governing parties lost a considerable number of voters and seats to either the opposition or euroskeptical parties .
in many places , critics of european unity were on an ascendant course , like in britain , where the anti-eu uk independence party scored a major upset .
low turnout voter apathy proved to be another uncomfortable trend .
despite the membership of 10 new states in the eu , a total of less than 45 percent of european voters made their voices be heard . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats suffer double defeat exit polls on sunday showed german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats taking a drubbing in elections for the european parliament .

on average , only 44.6 percent of eligible european voters turned up at their local polling stations to vote for the members of parliament who will represent their countries .
though no single trend marked the election , in a number of countries voters punished incumbent governments for everything from social system reforms to iraq war policies .
other elections were clouded by low voter turnout .
despite their newfound membership in the eu , many eastern europeans shied away from the pools .
while 47.7 percent of registered voters in the original eu member states cast ballots sunday , a meager 28.7 percent of voters in the new member states participated in the election .
bildunterschrift : preliminary results early results in germany showed the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , leading with about 45 percent .
though the parties registered slight losses over 1999 , they still managed to gain almost half of germany 's seats in parliament - more than double that of the social democrats .
leading opposition politicians declared sunday that new federal parliamentary elections for the bundestag should be held in the wake of the decisive european vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : division of parliamentary seats voters on sunday dealt the governing social democratic party a serious blow , reducing its mandate in parliament by 9.3 percent drop to 21 percent .
the greens , the junior government coalition partner , racked up a gain of 5.4 percent , with 11.8 percent of the voters , and the business-friendly free democratic party gained 3 percent , attracting 6 percent of the votes .
the party of social democracy , the successor to east germany 's communist party , also gained 0.4 percent , or 6.2 percent of the vote .
bildunterschrift : election gains and lasses the success of germany 's conservative christian democrats was mirrored across europe , with its strasbourg counterpart , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- gaining the largest number of seats in parliament .
a gallup poll showed epp winning between 247 and 277 of parliaments total 732 seats .
but the social democrats , were only expected to win 189 to 209 seats .
the liberals are expected to win third place , with the greens and socialists following .
in the last european election in 1999 , the epp also gained the biggest number of seats .
head-to-head race in austria elsewhere in europe , early results also trickled out sunday evening .
in france , the opposition socialists won a decisive victory over the political camp of french president jacques chirac .
election night exit polls showed the socialists gaining 8 points , with a total of 30 percent of the votes .
chirac 's conservative union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- scored 16.5 percent of the votes and the center-right union for french democracy attracted about 12 percent of voters - a marked turnaround from the parties ' domestic electoral triumph in 2002 .
critical brits in great britain , euroskeptics scored a triumphant victory .
the once marginal uk independence party , which has called on britain to leave the eu , won 18 percent of the vote , drawing many voters from the conservative tories .
the british voted on thursday night , with the governing labor party chalking up major losses .
tony blair 's labor lost a total of 6 points , gaining just 22 percent of the votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.06.2004 eu elections test german government 's stamina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 24 parties compete for 99 seats in germany 's eu parliamentary bloc .
germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .
this was the case the last time europeans elected their parliament in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : eu campaigns are just window-dressing candidates are in top gear throughout the eu , stumping for election to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- .

the day 's big surprise in austria , however , was hans-peter martin , an independent member of parliament and anti-corruption campaigner who won 14 percent of the votes and two seats for his list of independent candidates .
in may , martin created waves after accusing his colleagues in parliament of padding their expense reports and committing petty fraud .
on the mediterranean island of cyprus , the left-leaning akel party appeared on track to become the country 's strongest party in the european parliament .
cypriot broadcaster rik reported that the party was on track to win 29 percent of the votes and two of the country 's seats in parliament .
meanwhile , the opposition right-wing disy was on track to get 25 percent of the vote and two seats in strasbourg .
despite cypriot law requiring all eligible citizens to vote , turnout also appeared relatively low .
three months after its domestic parliamentary victors , spain 's socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by prime minister josé rodriguez zapatero , also appeared on course to become the most powerful spanish party in strasbourg .
a message from voters citizens across europe this week used the european election as an opportunity to send a warning vote to their national governments .
in britain , denmark , the czech republic and other eu states , governing parties lost a considerable number of voters and seats to either the opposition or euroskeptical parties .
in many places , critics of european unity were on an ascendant course , like in britain , where the anti-eu uk independence party scored a major upset .
low turnout voter apathy proved to be another uncomfortable trend .
despite the membership of 10 new states in the eu , a total of less than 45 percent of european voters made their voices be heard . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats suffer double defeat exit polls on sunday showed german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats taking a drubbing in elections for the european parliament .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .
annual show of pride bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christopher street day parade in cologne , july 6 , 2003 .
next year 's europride will take place in oslo , norway .
in contrast to germany , where numerous csd parades take place throughout the summer , the scandinavian country has expressed concern over hosting the event .
the lutheran mission , a division of norway 's state lutheran church , has protested holding the celebration out of fear the city would become a magnet for gays .
the lutheran mission , which aims to spread the word of the bible at home and abroad , sees homosexuality in stark contrast to christian sexual morals which are based on marriage and fidelity .
for the organizers of europride , opposition to the event from the religious community is little reason for concern .
norway , like other northern european countries , has a liberal political approach to homosexuality . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when turkish men love men homosexuality is taboo in turkey .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .
chancellor schröder could then come out on top in 2006 . grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european parliament elections 2004 dw-world 's full coverage of this year 's european parliamentary elections .

germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .
this was the case the last time europeans elected their parliament in 1999 . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : eu campaigns are just window-dressing candidates are in top gear throughout the eu , stumping for election to the european parliament -lrb- ep -rrb- .

although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green party candidate for europe : daniel cohn-bendit the junior coalition partners , the greens , stand to fare better .
they should get about 12 to 13 percent - well above the 8.6 percent they generated in the last federal elections .
this is partially enabled by the fact that their top candidate , daniel cohn-bendit , is a well-known politician and the party 's european platform has been relatively well publicized compared to the other parties .
the opposition conservative christian democrat union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is expected to pull in about 45 percent of the vote , despite the fact that none of the party 's candidates are well known among the general public .
opposition politicians are interpreting the predicted win as a sign that germans want a change in the nation 's policies .
" people in germany are extremely dissatisfied with the policies of the federal government , " bavarian premier and former opposition leader edmund stoiber said sunday as he cast his vote .
state and communal elections sunday also brings a slew of local elections as people in thuringia cast their ballot for the state parliament , and communal elections take place in baden-wuerttemberg , mecklenburg-western pomerania , rhineland-palatinate , saarland , saxony and saxony-anhalt .
in the eastern state of thuringia , the results are n't expected to change much for the spd , since the party is not in power anyway .
interest will focus primarily on whether the christian democrats can hold onto their absolute majority .
if they lose it , they could be forced into an uncomfortable coalition with the greens , which would be a first in germany .
one possible outcome of the multiple elections is that turnout is likely to be higher for the eu elections in thuringia and the six other states than it ordinarily would be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.06.2004 eu elections test german government 's stamina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 24 parties compete for 99 seats in germany 's eu parliamentary bloc .
germans go to the polls sunday to elect the biggest bloc of deputies to the european parliament .
although low voter turnout is expected , the outcome is being viewed as a litmus test for federal politics . after three days of voting across the european union , germans got their chance on june 13 to cast a ballot for their country 's 99 deputies to the european parliament - the biggest bloc of seats in the eu 's expanded legislature comprised of 25 members .
as in the rest of the union , voter turnout is predicted to be low - around 42 percent in germany - reflecting a general disinterest in politics made in brussels .
of the 63.6 million eligible voters in germany , including about two million eu foreigners , those who do make their way to the polls are expected to send a message to berlin 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens .
coming two years after the last federal elections , sunday 's vote is being viewed as a litmus test for national politics , especially since the mainstream parties ' eu candidates are running on platforms coinciding with their national agenda .
a lackluster campaign on european issues and a lack of understanding among the electorate about the eu as well as an absence of high-profile candidates have left many voters with little choice other than to follow federal party lines .
according to opinion polls , such voting behavior will likely lead to sharp losses for the spd , as voters demonstrate their dissatisfaction with chancellor gerhard schröder and his party 's inability to reduce unemployment and fire-up the euro zone 's biggest economy .
a warning for the spd ?
the election is shaping up to be a mid-term referendum for the ruling party , and could result in the spd gaining no more than 30 percent of the vote , far lower than the 38.5 percent that just barely allowed them to win the 2002 federal elections .
the social democrats ' top candidate is martin schulz , whose main claim to fame at home and abroad was his much-publicized dispute in the european parliament with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi almost a year ago .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .

the 10-day festival drew 360,000 people from across europe to the northern german city . drag queens paraded on high plateaus over cobblestone streets and sailor-costumed dancers mixed with men decked out in leather as trucks converted into mobile discos rolled through downtown hamburg on saturday .
the city was celebrating europride 2004 , the biggest gay and lesbian festival in europe .
more than 360,000 people took to the streets showing their true colors in the parade , which is the highlight of the 10-day celebrations .
twelve party trucks with booming bases and outlandish decoration , including one covered in a giant condom , churned out a thousand watts of dance music and got the spirit pumping .
under the motto " love breaks barriers , " the 11th annual festival sought to embrace homosexuals from across europe , and especially in the new eu member states of eastern europe , where many gays and lesbians are still forced to keep their sexual orientation under wraps .
political support hamburg 's mayor ole von beust of the conservative christian democrats , who is openly gay , joined the ranks of flamboyant celebrities as an official sponsor of the festivities .
on saturday evening , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens party gave the keynote speech in which he stressed the need for germany to continue working towards integration and equality for the gay community in the areas of adoption and marriage .
drawing attention to the situation in the new eu member states , social democrat member of european parliament christa randzio-plath said of the 10 new members , only one of them had established laws prohibiting the discrimination of gays and lesbians .
according to surveys conducted in eastern europe , acceptance for homosexuality is considerably lower than in the rest of the eu .
combining elements of carnival and political demonstrations , the parade recalled the traditional christopher street day -lrb- csd -rrb- of 1969 when homosexuals in new york first fought back against police brutality and discrimination , thus beginning the campaign for more tolerance and equality .

but the loss does not necessarily mean that the opposition christian democrats will sweep back to power . germany ’ s ruling social democrats have suffered their most serious election defeat since the founding of west germany in 1949 .
but there will probably not be any top-level resignations or a cabinet reshuffle in berlin .
the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .
the greatest mistake the christian democrats can make in the hour of their triumph at the european elections and in the eastern state of thuringia is to embark upon a policy of blocking government reform proposals in the upper house .
germany can not afford to lose any time .
it needs change now .
without doubt it is in the national interest for the ruling parties and the opposition to work together to get the most urgent reforms through parliament as soon as possible .
the first projects they should tackle together are a sweeping reduction in income tax , cuts in government subsidies and a reduction of bureaucratic obstacles for business .
after all , the negotiations between the two sides on germany ’ s new immigration legislation have shown that cooperation is possible if government and opposition put their minds to it .
the dilemma for the opposition christian democrats is obvious .
if the economy picks up , schröder ’ s chances will improve .
if they refuse to cooperate and demand the implementation of their own reform proposals , proposals which are more sweeping than the government ’ s , the electorate may well opt for the devil they know , rather than the devil they do not .

the reason is simple .
the social democrats knew they were going to lose heavily because of the unpopularity of their reform policies .
however , chancellor gerhard schröder can not reverse his policies .
if he does , he will lose the next election in 2006 anyway .
he has no choice but to continue to slash government spending and improve the country ’ s international competitiveness .
his only hope is that when the reforms begin to have an impact next year , economic growth will pick up once again and thus reduce unemployment .

on average , only 44.6 percent of eligible european voters turned up at their local polling stations to vote for the members of parliament who will represent their countries .
though no single trend marked the election , in a number of countries voters punished incumbent governments for everything from social system reforms to iraq war policies .
other elections were clouded by low voter turnout .
despite their newfound membership in the eu , many eastern europeans shied away from the pools .
while 47.7 percent of registered voters in the original eu member states cast ballots sunday , a meager 28.7 percent of voters in the new member states participated in the election .
bildunterschrift : preliminary results early results in germany showed the conservative christian democratic union and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union , leading with about 45 percent .
though the parties registered slight losses over 1999 , they still managed to gain almost half of germany 's seats in parliament - more than double that of the social democrats .
leading opposition politicians declared sunday that new federal parliamentary elections for the bundestag should be held in the wake of the decisive european vote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : division of parliamentary seats voters on sunday dealt the governing social democratic party a serious blow , reducing its mandate in parliament by 9.3 percent drop to 21 percent .
the greens , the junior government coalition partner , racked up a gain of 5.4 percent , with 11.8 percent of the voters , and the business-friendly free democratic party gained 3 percent , attracting 6 percent of the votes .
the party of social democracy , the successor to east germany 's communist party , also gained 0.4 percent , or 6.2 percent of the vote .
bildunterschrift : election gains and lasses the success of germany 's conservative christian democrats was mirrored across europe , with its strasbourg counterpart , the european people 's party -lrb- epp -rrb- gaining the largest number of seats in parliament .
a gallup poll showed epp winning between 247 and 277 of parliaments total 732 seats .
but the social democrats , were only expected to win 189 to 209 seats .
the liberals are expected to win third place , with the greens and socialists following .
in the last european election in 1999 , the epp also gained the biggest number of seats .
head-to-head race in austria elsewhere in europe , early results also trickled out sunday evening .
in france , the opposition socialists won a decisive victory over the political camp of french president jacques chirac .
election night exit polls showed the socialists gaining 8 points , with a total of 30 percent of the votes .
chirac 's conservative union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- scored 16.5 percent of the votes and the center-right union for french democracy attracted about 12 percent of voters - a marked turnaround from the parties ' domestic electoral triumph in 2002 .
critical brits in great britain , euroskeptics scored a triumphant victory .
the once marginal uk independence party , which has called on britain to leave the eu , won 18 percent of the vote , drawing many voters from the conservative tories .
the british voted on thursday night , with the governing labor party chalking up major losses .
tony blair 's labor lost a total of 6 points , gaining just 22 percent of the votes .
but the tories fared even worse , falling 14 percentage points to 22 percent .
opposition gains in czech republic exit polls in the czech republic released on saturday night showed a dismal 10.5 percent result for the governing social democrats , whereas the euroskeptic ods party of president vaclav havel was set to gain 31 percent of voters .
the dramatically anti-european kscm party , meanwhile , was expected to score 17 percent of the votes . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats suffer double defeat exit polls on sunday showed german chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats taking a drubbing in elections for the european parliament .

there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .
the worker 's party will get three seats in parliament , with the remaining two going to the nationalists .
voter turnout in malta was far greater than in other eu states , with 82 percent of citizens casting ballots .

there , the social democrats were poised to double their 1999 result , gaining 33.5 percent of the votes - in a clear voter reaction against the policies of the conservative government of prime minister anders fogh rasmussen , whose party lost about 5 percentage points , down to 18.7 percent .
a punishing day for incumbents in malta , the governing nationalists have already conceded defeat .
the island 's citizens went to the polls on saturday , and the party 's general secretary , joe saliba , declared that the opposition workers ' party won the majority .
the worker 's party will get three seats in parliament , with the remaining two going to the nationalists .
voter turnout in malta was far greater than in other eu states , with 82 percent of citizens casting ballots .
incumbent governments were also punished by voters in ireland , latvia and the netherlands .
in the eu 's largest new member state , poland , polls showed the governing left party gaining just 11 percent of the vote , with exceptionally low voter turnout of 30 percent .
but greece 's conservative government bucked what otherwise appeared to be a trend by gaining voters .
prime minister costas karamanlis 's new democracy party scored 42.5 percent of the votes , close to 10 percentage points more than the opposition socialist pasok party .
in austria , the opposition social democrats -lrb- spö -rrb- were in a head-to-head race with the conservative people 's party -lrb- övp -rrb- , led by chancellor wolfgang schüssel .
övp 's junior coalition party , the right-wing populist freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- appeared on course for a dramatic fall - from 23 to only 6 percent .
the day 's big surprise in austria , however , was hans-peter martin , an independent member of parliament and anti-corruption campaigner who won 14 percent of the votes and two seats for his list of independent candidates .
in may , martin created waves after accusing his colleagues in parliament of padding their expense reports and committing petty fraud .
on the mediterranean island of cyprus , the left-leaning akel party appeared on track to become the country 's strongest party in the european parliament .
cypriot broadcaster rik reported that the party was on track to win 29 percent of the votes and two of the country 's seats in parliament .
meanwhile , the opposition right-wing disy was on track to get 25 percent of the vote and two seats in strasbourg .
despite cypriot law requiring all eligible citizens to vote , turnout also appeared relatively low .
three months after its domestic parliamentary victors , spain 's socialist workers ' party -lrb- psoe -rrb- , led by prime minister josé rodriguez zapatero , also appeared on course to become the most powerful spanish party in strasbourg .
a message from voters citizens across europe this week used the european election as an opportunity to send a warning vote to their national governments .
in britain , denmark , the czech republic and other eu states , governing parties lost a considerable number of voters and seats to either the opposition or euroskeptical parties .
in many places , critics of european unity were on an ascendant course , like in britain , where the anti-eu uk independence party scored a major upset .
low turnout voter apathy proved to be another uncomfortable trend .

though no single trend marked the election , in a number of countries voters punished incumbent governments for everything from social system reforms to iraq war policies .
other elections were clouded by low voter turnout .
despite their newfound membership in the eu , many eastern europeans shied away from the pools .
while 47.7 percent of registered voters in the original eu member states cast ballots sunday , a meager 28.7 percent of voters in the new member states participated in the election .

a gallup poll showed epp winning between 247 and 277 of parliaments total 732 seats .
but the social democrats , were only expected to win 189 to 209 seats .
the liberals are expected to win third place , with the greens and socialists following .
in the last european election in 1999 , the epp also gained the biggest number of seats .

in france , the opposition socialists won a decisive victory over the political camp of french president jacques chirac .
election night exit polls showed the socialists gaining 8 points , with a total of 30 percent of the votes .
chirac 's conservative union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- scored 16.5 percent of the votes and the center-right union for french democracy attracted about 12 percent of voters - a marked turnaround from the parties ' domestic electoral triumph in 2002 .

the british voted on thursday night , with the governing labor party chalking up major losses .
tony blair 's labor lost a total of 6 points , gaining just 22 percent of the votes .
but the tories fared even worse , falling 14 percentage points to 22 percent .

lives saved statistics show there has been a significant drop in drownings .
last summer there were only six on record , a big drop from an average of 14 .
there are other benefits , too .

seconds count when it comes to saving a life they are using a computer surveillance system to monitor australia 's beaches in an attempt to reduce deaths by drowning .
" surf life savers work in an operational environment where seconds count , so having a good communications system that can capture data quickly is vitally important .
it will and can save lives , " said peter dawes of surf life saving .
the nerve centre of surfcom might look like an ordinary beach shack , but it is home to a communication system that is revolutionising surf life-saving .
on location , on time surfcom is the gold coast emergency communications centre for life-savers in queensland .
it is a purpose-built , fully integrated radio , telecommunications and computer network for the beach .
they 're so advanced in what they 're doing , they 're actually customising software to suit their own needs peter dawes , surf life saving the alarm can be triggered by a member of the public on the beach or by simply phoning-in .
the call can then be tracked on the surfcom system .
" the simplicity of it is that the operator pushes the button and that sends the signal through our radio network and the information pops up as an icon on our map , " said mark parsons of zetron australasia , which provided the technology .
" the operators here can then send information to people out there on location at the time . "
jet boat teams are then dispatched and the rescue is co-ordinated and tracked using global positioning systems .
beach cameras can zero in on trouble spots while an emergency services helicopter provides aerial surveillance and support .
it is the only dedicated surf and beach surveillance and communications network in australia , driven by a unique software system that was in fact custom-built and designed by volunteer surf life-savers .
" in many ways these are different surf life-savers than many are used to seeing , " said mr dawes " they 're indoors , they 're operating computers in an indoor environment , and they 're so advanced in what they 're doing , they 're actually customising software to suit their own needs . "
watching you surfcom was introduced after a record number of tourist drownings in 2002 .
stations on the beach communicate to the surfcom network during the first five months of operation last year , surfcom received around 1,000 calls per day and over 120 beach emergencies were coordinated .
" we 're also looking at sms-type activities that members of the public can provide information to these centres on a national basis and actually provide information out to our services , " said mr parsons .
in addition to sms , surfcom will also be upgrading its surf safety camera system .
there are currently two analogue cameras in operation on the gold coast .
by late next year there will be four digital cameras in place , and this is just the start of a nationwide roll-out .
beach cameras attract a good deal of controversy .
surfcom says the cameras are part of a bigger picture , to help monitor swimmers on un-patrolled beaches or where surf rescue resources are thin on the ground .
lives saved statistics show there has been a significant drop in drownings .
last summer there were only six on record , a big drop from an average of 14 .
there are other benefits , too .
under the old system , rescue data was analysed only at year end .
the new system records it instantly , letting life savers take a proactive , rather than reactive approach .
" the idea is that we will progressively roll out the ip cameras and we will have a wireless solution that will not only run our cameras but also pda devices and also portable internet access for our services throughout the coast area , " said mr parsons .

seconds count when it comes to saving a life they are using a computer surveillance system to monitor australia 's beaches in an attempt to reduce deaths by drowning .
" surf life savers work in an operational environment where seconds count , so having a good communications system that can capture data quickly is vitally important .
it will and can save lives , " said peter dawes of surf life saving .
the nerve centre of surfcom might look like an ordinary beach shack , but it is home to a communication system that is revolutionising surf life-saving .
on location , on time surfcom is the gold coast emergency communications centre for life-savers in queensland .
it is a purpose-built , fully integrated radio , telecommunications and computer network for the beach .
they 're so advanced in what they 're doing , they 're actually customising software to suit their own needs peter dawes , surf life saving the alarm can be triggered by a member of the public on the beach or by simply phoning-in .
the call can then be tracked on the surfcom system .
" the simplicity of it is that the operator pushes the button and that sends the signal through our radio network and the information pops up as an icon on our map , " said mark parsons of zetron australasia , which provided the technology .
" the operators here can then send information to people out there on location at the time . "
jet boat teams are then dispatched and the rescue is co-ordinated and tracked using global positioning systems .
beach cameras can zero in on trouble spots while an emergency services helicopter provides aerial surveillance and support .
it is the only dedicated surf and beach surveillance and communications network in australia , driven by a unique software system that was in fact custom-built and designed by volunteer surf life-savers .
" in many ways these are different surf life-savers than many are used to seeing , " said mr dawes " they 're indoors , they 're operating computers in an indoor environment , and they 're so advanced in what they 're doing , they 're actually customising software to suit their own needs . "
watching you surfcom was introduced after a record number of tourist drownings in 2002 .
stations on the beach communicate to the surfcom network during the first five months of operation last year , surfcom received around 1,000 calls per day and over 120 beach emergencies were coordinated .
" we 're also looking at sms-type activities that members of the public can provide information to these centres on a national basis and actually provide information out to our services , " said mr parsons .
in addition to sms , surfcom will also be upgrading its surf safety camera system .
there are currently two analogue cameras in operation on the gold coast .
by late next year there will be four digital cameras in place , and this is just the start of a nationwide roll-out .
beach cameras attract a good deal of controversy .
surfcom says the cameras are part of a bigger picture , to help monitor swimmers on un-patrolled beaches or where surf rescue resources are thin on the ground .
lives saved statistics show there has been a significant drop in drownings .
last summer there were only six on record , a big drop from an average of 14 .
there are other benefits , too .
under the old system , rescue data was analysed only at year end .
the new system records it instantly , letting life savers take a proactive , rather than reactive approach .
" the idea is that we will progressively roll out the ip cameras and we will have a wireless solution that will not only run our cameras but also pda devices and also portable internet access for our services throughout the coast area , " said mr parsons .
australia has long been looked to as a leader in lifeguard innovation .
now many overseas lifeguard services in the uk and asia are considering adopting the australian technology .

but in seven days while working undercover as a hospital cleaner in tunbridge wells , in kent , i saw them all and worse .
i applied for a job with the in-house cleaning service at the kent and sussex hospital after bbc south east today received complaints about its hygiene - questions had also been raised about cleanliness standards in several official reports .
during my time at the hospital i saw patients exposed to possible infections , a culture of laziness and hospital policies being breached - even by some in-house supervisors .
buttonhole camera on 4 may armed with just 45 minutes practical training , a fake past and a tiny camera in my buttonhole i became the latest accident & emergency -lrb- a & e -rrb- department cleaner .
a month earlier i had asked the in-house domestic management team employed by maidstone and tunbridge wells health trust if they needed cleaners .
i was invited to a short interview and then sent to see the occupational health nurse who said i was fit enough to work as a trust employee .
on my first day as i emptied bins , swept and mopped i noticed old blood stains ingrained on the floor .
with a fake reference and a button hole camera i started work i also saw unlocked sharps bins containing used needles lying in corridors - i was never told where to store them or how to handle them .
clinical waste skips , which contain bags full of old dressings and bodily fluids , were left open in corridors used by visitors and patients , even though the hospital 's own policy says they should always be locked .
the clinical waste skip i had to use also filled up quickly so rubbish bags had to be left on the floor - when i asked a supervisor what to do with them i was told to leave them beside the skip .
in a & e 's operating theatre , a blood-stained gown was left on a trolley for 24 hours and used medical instruments were discarded in a sink for a day .
on a window ledge in the same theatre i found such a large build up of old dirt that i had to use a dustpan and brush to clean it .
in the resuscitation room , an old stain was streaked down a wall - i tried to clean it but it was so old it would not shift .
i saw the same poor standards day after day and found some of the cleaners who were meant to fix the problems slacking .
some stood in the a & e storeroom reading newspapers , others would leave their wards to come and talk to me , another sat in the changing room half an hour before her shift ended .
some took extended tea breaks and would routinely leave early .
bags of clinical waste and sharps bins piled up in the corridors supervisors were aware of problems but seemed powerless to stop them .
hospitals all have a hand-washing technique to cut the risk of spreading infections between patients - a crucial stage of this is drying hands on paper towels .
when i realised a & e was running low i was told i would have to wait for the next delivery in three days time as there were no reserves of hand towels left in the hospital .
a nurse said this was unacceptable but luckily an emergency supply arrived the next day .
a supervisor told me some domestics were putting patients at risk of cross infection by not washing their water jugs in hot soapy water - she said she kept telling them how to do it but they did not listen .
on a ward where four of the patients were being barrier-nursed to stop infections spreading i saw it happen .
the cleaner collected the jugs from every patient and simply swilled them in cold water before re-filling and randomly returning all but one of them .
i asked if they should be washed and she replied : " if you like but in the morning they wash them in very hot water so in the evening i do n't bother . "
dirt was found underneath baskets containing sterile equipment the footage was shown to professor hugh pennington , one of the uk 's leading microbiologists , he said , " it 's a dirty hospital , the worst i 've ever seen and it 's putting the lives of patients and the lives of staff at risk . "
in response to the investigation rose gibb , who took over as chief executive of the maidstone and tunbridge wells trust six months ago , said : " i accept the hospital has standards that are poor .
" i acknowledge that , i have made that clear to my board .
" we 're investing , we are making radical changes , it takes time to get sustained improvement , and i will not stop until i get the standards that i believe the population deserves . "
miss gibb said patients were not being exposed to unnecessary risks , she said : " you have no more risk of acquiring mrsa at the kent and sussex than at the average hospital in london . "
she said the hospital would be up to scratch in nine months time .

but in seven days while working undercover as a hospital cleaner in tunbridge wells , in kent , i saw them all and worse .
i applied for a job with the in-house cleaning service at the kent and sussex hospital after bbc south east today received complaints about its hygiene - questions had also been raised about cleanliness standards in several official reports .
during my time at the hospital i saw patients exposed to possible infections , a culture of laziness and hospital policies being breached - even by some in-house supervisors .
buttonhole camera on 4 may armed with just 45 minutes practical training , a fake past and a tiny camera in my buttonhole i became the latest accident & emergency -lrb- a & e -rrb- department cleaner .
a month earlier i had asked the in-house domestic management team employed by maidstone and tunbridge wells health trust if they needed cleaners .
i was invited to a short interview and then sent to see the occupational health nurse who said i was fit enough to work as a trust employee .
on my first day as i emptied bins , swept and mopped i noticed old blood stains ingrained on the floor .
with a fake reference and a button hole camera i started work i also saw unlocked sharps bins containing used needles lying in corridors - i was never told where to store them or how to handle them .
clinical waste skips , which contain bags full of old dressings and bodily fluids , were left open in corridors used by visitors and patients , even though the hospital 's own policy says they should always be locked .
the clinical waste skip i had to use also filled up quickly so rubbish bags had to be left on the floor - when i asked a supervisor what to do with them i was told to leave them beside the skip .
in a & e 's operating theatre , a blood-stained gown was left on a trolley for 24 hours and used medical instruments were discarded in a sink for a day .
on a window ledge in the same theatre i found such a large build up of old dirt that i had to use a dustpan and brush to clean it .
in the resuscitation room , an old stain was streaked down a wall - i tried to clean it but it was so old it would not shift .
i saw the same poor standards day after day and found some of the cleaners who were meant to fix the problems slacking .
some stood in the a & e storeroom reading newspapers , others would leave their wards to come and talk to me , another sat in the changing room half an hour before her shift ended .
some took extended tea breaks and would routinely leave early .
bags of clinical waste and sharps bins piled up in the corridors supervisors were aware of problems but seemed powerless to stop them .
hospitals all have a hand-washing technique to cut the risk of spreading infections between patients - a crucial stage of this is drying hands on paper towels .
when i realised a & e was running low i was told i would have to wait for the next delivery in three days time as there were no reserves of hand towels left in the hospital .
a nurse said this was unacceptable but luckily an emergency supply arrived the next day .
a supervisor told me some domestics were putting patients at risk of cross infection by not washing their water jugs in hot soapy water - she said she kept telling them how to do it but they did not listen .
on a ward where four of the patients were being barrier-nursed to stop infections spreading i saw it happen .
the cleaner collected the jugs from every patient and simply swilled them in cold water before re-filling and randomly returning all but one of them .
i asked if they should be washed and she replied : " if you like but in the morning they wash them in very hot water so in the evening i do n't bother . "
dirt was found underneath baskets containing sterile equipment the footage was shown to professor hugh pennington , one of the uk 's leading microbiologists , he said , " it 's a dirty hospital , the worst i 've ever seen and it 's putting the lives of patients and the lives of staff at risk . "
in response to the investigation rose gibb , who took over as chief executive of the maidstone and tunbridge wells trust six months ago , said : " i accept the hospital has standards that are poor .
" i acknowledge that , i have made that clear to my board .
" we 're investing , we are making radical changes , it takes time to get sustained improvement , and i will not stop until i get the standards that i believe the population deserves . "
miss gibb said patients were not being exposed to unnecessary risks , she said : " you have no more risk of acquiring mrsa at the kent and sussex than at the average hospital in london . "
she said the hospital would be up to scratch in nine months time .
next year bbc south east today 's cameras will be going back to see if that pledge is met .
the bbc south east today undercover report can be seen on bbc one on monday at 1830 bst or for viewers outside the south east region on digital channel 953 .
