a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .
mai 2002 , in der vestas rotorblatt-fabrik im brandenburgischen lauchhammer mit dem modell einer windkraftanlage der firma .
am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .

-lrb- may 2 , 2004 -rrb- law fosters renewable energy in germany after german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin finally reached a compromise on the long-debated and highly controversial carbon emission cap , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens came together again on friday to pass sweeping new renewable energy legislation despite strong opposition from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
-lrb- april 4 , 2004 -rrb- germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .

for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 opinion : exploiting inhumanity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video showing nick berg being killed was put online tuesday the beheading of an american man in iraq and circulation of the video on the internet marks a new low in the public exploitation of violence . the pictures are becoming ever more unbearable : first the abused iraqi prisoners , now the young american beheaded on camera .
or the photographs of iraqi children shot in the back by british soldiers .
or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .

closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .

despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .

berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .
former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts . a decade and a half after the collapse of former communist east germany , the berlin-based east german stasi archive hardly raises a ripple of interest within the country with the exceptions of the disclosure of sensitive files belonging to high-ranking politicians . but overseas , particularly in countries trying to come to terms with their own totalitarian pasts , the archive 's know-how and categorization methods in shedding light on millions of files maintained by the stasi - east germany 's secret police - are considered invaluable . in recent years , six former soviet bloc countries - romania , slovakia , bulgaria , poland , the czech republic and hungary - have used the east german archive to confront their own brutal pasts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive in germany " coming to terms with east germany 's communist dictatorship has set standards for other states in dealing with their own communist pasts , " marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the east german stasi archive told news magazine spiegel . file legislation model for eastern europe set up in 1990 to investigate the biggest espionage system in history - more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under stasi observation - the archive faced a colossal logistical challenge . though the stasi shredded thousands of files detailing their network of spies and informers in the run-up to the collapse of the governmnet on november 9 , 1989 , millions more were found bound in massive sacks or strewn around the secret service 's offices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piles of stasi files in the stasi archive in erfurt , eastern germany .
in 1991 , the german parliament passed a unique law regulating the access to files for both victims of spying and former spies .
the law allows people who were spied upon to view their dossiers .
they can find out who spied on them , but to prevent recriminations and revenge-taking , they are not given access to the spy 's files . this legal framework , especially , has served as a model for lawmakers in the former communist eastern european countries .
poland , the czech republic and hungary have all passed similar laws opening up secret service files in their countries ' in the 1990s and have been coordinating with the stasi archive to prosecute members of the communist regime . argentina hopes to learn from stasi archive the east german archive 's work is now generating interest even beyond european borders .
christian booss , the stasi archive 's spokesman confirmed that argentina , iraq and south africa - all struggling with their own past dictatorships - are hoping to take a page out of the archive 's book . at the same time , booss added that the stasi archive 's role was to simply share its experience .
" all we do is explain our work , answer questions .
we 're no experts who want to export our model worldwide , " booss told dw-world .
" it 's more like we 're offering our services , we 're advisors . " last december , argentinean nobel prize winner adolfo pèrez esquivel , who runs the argentinean memory commission in buenos aires , paid a visit to the stasi archive in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former argentine dictator gen. leopoldo galtieri , who was arrested in buenos aires on july 11 , 2002 .
though it was only last summer that argentina lifted the amnesty laws that had protected the generals responsible for crimes during the military dictatorship that lasted from 1974 to 1983 , the stasi archive has promised to aid buenos aires .
together with two foundations , the argentineans will now study the german method of dealing with the espionage files . " we could learn from the germans " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
a similar cooperation is planned with iraq , which suffered under the brutal reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes . earlier this year , hasan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans are very methodic and very stringent on questions of privacy .
we could pick up a lot from them , " meneimneh said . germany 's foreign ministry is now planning to set aside funds for helping iraqis come to terms with their past . booss however warns that the countries seeking help should first " secure their files , pass clear legislation and ensure the work is independent of day-to-day politics . "
however , he admitted , " unfortunately these conditions do n't exist in all the countries . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany aids iraq in coming to grips with its past the director of germany 's vast archive on east germany 's secret police has met with iraqi groups in washington to counsel them on how to proceed with a similarly difficult attempt to deal with the past .
-lrb- dec .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .
the jury faced with picking the winners from this very mixed bag of 18 entries is headed by quirky american director , quentin tarantino -lrb- photo -rrb- , meaning an offbeat movie could well scoop the palme d 'or .

a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .
mai 2002 , in der vestas rotorblatt-fabrik im brandenburgischen lauchhammer mit dem modell einer windkraftanlage der firma .
am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .
-lrb- may 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .
-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .
mai 2002 , in der vestas rotorblatt-fabrik im brandenburgischen lauchhammer mit dem modell einer windkraftanlage der firma .
am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy .
-lrb- may 2 , 2004 -rrb- law fosters renewable energy in germany after german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin finally reached a compromise on the long-debated and highly controversial carbon emission cap , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens came together again on friday to pass sweeping new renewable energy legislation despite strong opposition from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
-lrb- april 4 , 2004 -rrb- germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there .

closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 opinion : exploiting inhumanity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video showing nick berg being killed was put online tuesday the beheading of an american man in iraq and circulation of the video on the internet marks a new low in the public exploitation of violence . the pictures are becoming ever more unbearable : first the abused iraqi prisoners , now the young american beheaded on camera .
or the photographs of iraqi children shot in the back by british soldiers .
or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility .

or the photographs of iraqi children shot in the back by british soldiers .
or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .

among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .
-lrb- may 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .
former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts . a decade and a half after the collapse of former communist east germany , the berlin-based east german stasi archive hardly raises a ripple of interest within the country with the exceptions of the disclosure of sensitive files belonging to high-ranking politicians . but overseas , particularly in countries trying to come to terms with their own totalitarian pasts , the archive 's know-how and categorization methods in shedding light on millions of files maintained by the stasi - east germany 's secret police - are considered invaluable . in recent years , six former soviet bloc countries - romania , slovakia , bulgaria , poland , the czech republic and hungary - have used the east german archive to confront their own brutal pasts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive in germany " coming to terms with east germany 's communist dictatorship has set standards for other states in dealing with their own communist pasts , " marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the east german stasi archive told news magazine spiegel . file legislation model for eastern europe set up in 1990 to investigate the biggest espionage system in history - more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under stasi observation - the archive faced a colossal logistical challenge . though the stasi shredded thousands of files detailing their network of spies and informers in the run-up to the collapse of the governmnet on november 9 , 1989 , millions more were found bound in massive sacks or strewn around the secret service 's offices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piles of stasi files in the stasi archive in erfurt , eastern germany .
in 1991 , the german parliament passed a unique law regulating the access to files for both victims of spying and former spies .
the law allows people who were spied upon to view their dossiers .
they can find out who spied on them , but to prevent recriminations and revenge-taking , they are not given access to the spy 's files . this legal framework , especially , has served as a model for lawmakers in the former communist eastern european countries .
poland , the czech republic and hungary have all passed similar laws opening up secret service files in their countries ' in the 1990s and have been coordinating with the stasi archive to prosecute members of the communist regime . argentina hopes to learn from stasi archive the east german archive 's work is now generating interest even beyond european borders .
christian booss , the stasi archive 's spokesman confirmed that argentina , iraq and south africa - all struggling with their own past dictatorships - are hoping to take a page out of the archive 's book . at the same time , booss added that the stasi archive 's role was to simply share its experience .
" all we do is explain our work , answer questions .
we 're no experts who want to export our model worldwide , " booss told dw-world .
" it 's more like we 're offering our services , we 're advisors . " last december , argentinean nobel prize winner adolfo pèrez esquivel , who runs the argentinean memory commission in buenos aires , paid a visit to the stasi archive in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former argentine dictator gen. leopoldo galtieri , who was arrested in buenos aires on july 11 , 2002 .
though it was only last summer that argentina lifted the amnesty laws that had protected the generals responsible for crimes during the military dictatorship that lasted from 1974 to 1983 , the stasi archive has promised to aid buenos aires .
together with two foundations , the argentineans will now study the german method of dealing with the espionage files . " we could learn from the germans " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
a similar cooperation is planned with iraq , which suffered under the brutal reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes . earlier this year , hasan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans are very methodic and very stringent on questions of privacy .
we could pick up a lot from them , " meneimneh said . germany 's foreign ministry is now planning to set aside funds for helping iraqis come to terms with their past . booss however warns that the countries seeking help should first " secure their files , pass clear legislation and ensure the work is independent of day-to-day politics . "
however , he admitted , " unfortunately these conditions do n't exist in all the countries .

a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .

am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .

now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .
mai 2002 , in der vestas rotorblatt-fabrik im brandenburgischen lauchhammer mit dem modell einer windkraftanlage der firma .
am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy .

-lrb- april 4 , 2004 -rrb- germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2004 wind energy : more than hot air ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills generate 6 percent of germany 's energy so far germany generates more wind energy than any other country , but the renewable power source is not without its critics .
a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .
mai 2002 , in der vestas rotorblatt-fabrik im brandenburgischen lauchhammer mit dem modell einer windkraftanlage der firma .
am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .
it 's a difficult task for the small country , but committed environmentalists are trying to find new sources of energy .
-lrb- may 2 , 2004 -rrb- law fosters renewable energy in germany after german economics minister wolfgang clement and environmental minister jürgen trittin finally reached a compromise on the long-debated and highly controversial carbon emission cap , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens came together again on friday to pass sweeping new renewable energy legislation despite strong opposition from the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
-lrb- april 4 , 2004 -rrb- germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .
but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy .

former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts . a decade and a half after the collapse of former communist east germany , the berlin-based east german stasi archive hardly raises a ripple of interest within the country with the exceptions of the disclosure of sensitive files belonging to high-ranking politicians . but overseas , particularly in countries trying to come to terms with their own totalitarian pasts , the archive 's know-how and categorization methods in shedding light on millions of files maintained by the stasi - east germany 's secret police - are considered invaluable . in recent years , six former soviet bloc countries - romania , slovakia , bulgaria , poland , the czech republic and hungary - have used the east german archive to confront their own brutal pasts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive in germany " coming to terms with east germany 's communist dictatorship has set standards for other states in dealing with their own communist pasts , " marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the east german stasi archive told news magazine spiegel . file legislation model for eastern europe set up in 1990 to investigate the biggest espionage system in history - more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under stasi observation - the archive faced a colossal logistical challenge . though the stasi shredded thousands of files detailing their network of spies and informers in the run-up to the collapse of the governmnet on november 9 , 1989 , millions more were found bound in massive sacks or strewn around the secret service 's offices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piles of stasi files in the stasi archive in erfurt , eastern germany .
in 1991 , the german parliament passed a unique law regulating the access to files for both victims of spying and former spies .
the law allows people who were spied upon to view their dossiers .
they can find out who spied on them , but to prevent recriminations and revenge-taking , they are not given access to the spy 's files . this legal framework , especially , has served as a model for lawmakers in the former communist eastern european countries .
poland , the czech republic and hungary have all passed similar laws opening up secret service files in their countries ' in the 1990s and have been coordinating with the stasi archive to prosecute members of the communist regime . argentina hopes to learn from stasi archive the east german archive 's work is now generating interest even beyond european borders .
christian booss , the stasi archive 's spokesman confirmed that argentina , iraq and south africa - all struggling with their own past dictatorships - are hoping to take a page out of the archive 's book . at the same time , booss added that the stasi archive 's role was to simply share its experience .
" all we do is explain our work , answer questions .
we 're no experts who want to export our model worldwide , " booss told dw-world .
" it 's more like we 're offering our services , we 're advisors .

though it was only last summer that argentina lifted the amnesty laws that had protected the generals responsible for crimes during the military dictatorship that lasted from 1974 to 1983 , the stasi archive has promised to aid buenos aires .

a similar cooperation is planned with iraq , which suffered under the brutal reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes . earlier this year , hasan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans are very methodic and very stringent on questions of privacy .
we could pick up a lot from them , " meneimneh said . germany 's foreign ministry is now planning to set aside funds for helping iraqis come to terms with their past . booss however warns that the countries seeking help should first " secure their files , pass clear legislation and ensure the work is independent of day-to-day politics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts . a decade and a half after the collapse of former communist east germany , the berlin-based east german stasi archive hardly raises a ripple of interest within the country with the exceptions of the disclosure of sensitive files belonging to high-ranking politicians . but overseas , particularly in countries trying to come to terms with their own totalitarian pasts , the archive 's know-how and categorization methods in shedding light on millions of files maintained by the stasi - east germany 's secret police - are considered invaluable . in recent years , six former soviet bloc countries - romania , slovakia , bulgaria , poland , the czech republic and hungary - have used the east german archive to confront their own brutal pasts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive in germany " coming to terms with east germany 's communist dictatorship has set standards for other states in dealing with their own communist pasts , " marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the east german stasi archive told news magazine spiegel . file legislation model for eastern europe set up in 1990 to investigate the biggest espionage system in history - more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under stasi observation - the archive faced a colossal logistical challenge . though the stasi shredded thousands of files detailing their network of spies and informers in the run-up to the collapse of the governmnet on november 9 , 1989 , millions more were found bound in massive sacks or strewn around the secret service 's offices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piles of stasi files in the stasi archive in erfurt , eastern germany .
in 1991 , the german parliament passed a unique law regulating the access to files for both victims of spying and former spies .
the law allows people who were spied upon to view their dossiers .
they can find out who spied on them , but to prevent recriminations and revenge-taking , they are not given access to the spy 's files . this legal framework , especially , has served as a model for lawmakers in the former communist eastern european countries .
poland , the czech republic and hungary have all passed similar laws opening up secret service files in their countries ' in the 1990s and have been coordinating with the stasi archive to prosecute members of the communist regime . argentina hopes to learn from stasi archive the east german archive 's work is now generating interest even beyond european borders .
christian booss , the stasi archive 's spokesman confirmed that argentina , iraq and south africa - all struggling with their own past dictatorships - are hoping to take a page out of the archive 's book . at the same time , booss added that the stasi archive 's role was to simply share its experience .
" all we do is explain our work , answer questions .
we 're no experts who want to export our model worldwide , " booss told dw-world .
" it 's more like we 're offering our services , we 're advisors . " last december , argentinean nobel prize winner adolfo pèrez esquivel , who runs the argentinean memory commission in buenos aires , paid a visit to the stasi archive in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former argentine dictator gen. leopoldo galtieri , who was arrested in buenos aires on july 11 , 2002 .
though it was only last summer that argentina lifted the amnesty laws that had protected the generals responsible for crimes during the military dictatorship that lasted from 1974 to 1983 , the stasi archive has promised to aid buenos aires .
together with two foundations , the argentineans will now study the german method of dealing with the espionage files . " we could learn from the germans " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
a similar cooperation is planned with iraq , which suffered under the brutal reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes . earlier this year , hasan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans are very methodic and very stringent on questions of privacy .
we could pick up a lot from them , " meneimneh said . germany 's foreign ministry is now planning to set aside funds for helping iraqis come to terms with their past . booss however warns that the countries seeking help should first " secure their files , pass clear legislation and ensure the work is independent of day-to-day politics . "
however , he admitted , " unfortunately these conditions do n't exist in all the countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

or the photographs of iraqi children shot in the back by british soldiers .
or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "

a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 opinion : exploiting inhumanity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video showing nick berg being killed was put online tuesday the beheading of an american man in iraq and circulation of the video on the internet marks a new low in the public exploitation of violence . the pictures are becoming ever more unbearable : first the abused iraqi prisoners , now the young american beheaded on camera .
or the photographs of iraqi children shot in the back by british soldiers .
or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility .

a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .

harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 opinion : exploiting inhumanity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video showing nick berg being killed was put online tuesday the beheading of an american man in iraq and circulation of the video on the internet marks a new low in the public exploitation of violence . the pictures are becoming ever more unbearable : first the abused iraqi prisoners , now the young american beheaded on camera .
or the photographs of iraqi children shot in the back by british soldiers .
or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .
-lrb- may 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .
-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.05.2004 happy days are back as germany returns to cannes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " happy days are gone " features three friends fighting for social justice .
a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .
the jury faced with picking the winners from this very mixed bag of 18 entries is headed by quirky american director , quentin tarantino -lrb- photo -rrb- , meaning an offbeat movie could well scoop the palme d 'or .
in 1994 , the cannes jury gave the top prize " pulp fiction , " the film that helped turn tarantino into a household name . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german directors open the hollywood blockbuster season hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .

berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .
former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts . a decade and a half after the collapse of former communist east germany , the berlin-based east german stasi archive hardly raises a ripple of interest within the country with the exceptions of the disclosure of sensitive files belonging to high-ranking politicians . but overseas , particularly in countries trying to come to terms with their own totalitarian pasts , the archive 's know-how and categorization methods in shedding light on millions of files maintained by the stasi - east germany 's secret police - are considered invaluable . in recent years , six former soviet bloc countries - romania , slovakia , bulgaria , poland , the czech republic and hungary - have used the east german archive to confront their own brutal pasts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive in germany " coming to terms with east germany 's communist dictatorship has set standards for other states in dealing with their own communist pasts , " marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the east german stasi archive told news magazine spiegel . file legislation model for eastern europe set up in 1990 to investigate the biggest espionage system in history - more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under stasi observation - the archive faced a colossal logistical challenge . though the stasi shredded thousands of files detailing their network of spies and informers in the run-up to the collapse of the governmnet on november 9 , 1989 , millions more were found bound in massive sacks or strewn around the secret service 's offices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piles of stasi files in the stasi archive in erfurt , eastern germany .
in 1991 , the german parliament passed a unique law regulating the access to files for both victims of spying and former spies .
the law allows people who were spied upon to view their dossiers .
they can find out who spied on them , but to prevent recriminations and revenge-taking , they are not given access to the spy 's files . this legal framework , especially , has served as a model for lawmakers in the former communist eastern european countries .
poland , the czech republic and hungary have all passed similar laws opening up secret service files in their countries ' in the 1990s and have been coordinating with the stasi archive to prosecute members of the communist regime . argentina hopes to learn from stasi archive the east german archive 's work is now generating interest even beyond european borders .
christian booss , the stasi archive 's spokesman confirmed that argentina , iraq and south africa - all struggling with their own past dictatorships - are hoping to take a page out of the archive 's book . at the same time , booss added that the stasi archive 's role was to simply share its experience .
" all we do is explain our work , answer questions .
we 're no experts who want to export our model worldwide , " booss told dw-world .
" it 's more like we 're offering our services , we 're advisors . " last december , argentinean nobel prize winner adolfo pèrez esquivel , who runs the argentinean memory commission in buenos aires , paid a visit to the stasi archive in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former argentine dictator gen. leopoldo galtieri , who was arrested in buenos aires on july 11 , 2002 .
though it was only last summer that argentina lifted the amnesty laws that had protected the generals responsible for crimes during the military dictatorship that lasted from 1974 to 1983 , the stasi archive has promised to aid buenos aires .
together with two foundations , the argentineans will now study the german method of dealing with the espionage files . " we could learn from the germans " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
a similar cooperation is planned with iraq , which suffered under the brutal reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes . earlier this year , hasan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans are very methodic and very stringent on questions of privacy .
we could pick up a lot from them , " meneimneh said . germany 's foreign ministry is now planning to set aside funds for helping iraqis come to terms with their past . booss however warns that the countries seeking help should first " secure their files , pass clear legislation and ensure the work is independent of day-to-day politics . "
however , he admitted , " unfortunately these conditions do n't exist in all the countries .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .

" fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .
-lrb- may 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .
-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .
the jury faced with picking the winners from this very mixed bag of 18 entries is headed by quirky american director , quentin tarantino -lrb- photo -rrb- , meaning an offbeat movie could well scoop the palme d 'or .
in 1994 , the cannes jury gave the top prize " pulp fiction , " the film that helped turn tarantino into a household name . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german directors open the hollywood blockbuster season hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .

berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .
former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts . a decade and a half after the collapse of former communist east germany , the berlin-based east german stasi archive hardly raises a ripple of interest within the country with the exceptions of the disclosure of sensitive files belonging to high-ranking politicians . but overseas , particularly in countries trying to come to terms with their own totalitarian pasts , the archive 's know-how and categorization methods in shedding light on millions of files maintained by the stasi - east germany 's secret police - are considered invaluable . in recent years , six former soviet bloc countries - romania , slovakia , bulgaria , poland , the czech republic and hungary - have used the east german archive to confront their own brutal pasts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive in germany " coming to terms with east germany 's communist dictatorship has set standards for other states in dealing with their own communist pasts , " marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the east german stasi archive told news magazine spiegel . file legislation model for eastern europe set up in 1990 to investigate the biggest espionage system in history - more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under stasi observation - the archive faced a colossal logistical challenge . though the stasi shredded thousands of files detailing their network of spies and informers in the run-up to the collapse of the governmnet on november 9 , 1989 , millions more were found bound in massive sacks or strewn around the secret service 's offices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piles of stasi files in the stasi archive in erfurt , eastern germany .

the law allows people who were spied upon to view their dossiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.05.2004 happy days are back as germany returns to cannes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " happy days are gone " features three friends fighting for social justice .
a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .
the jury faced with picking the winners from this very mixed bag of 18 entries is headed by quirky american director , quentin tarantino -lrb- photo -rrb- , meaning an offbeat movie could well scoop the palme d 'or .
in 1994 , the cannes jury gave the top prize " pulp fiction , " the film that helped turn tarantino into a household name . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german directors open the hollywood blockbuster season hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .
former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts . a decade and a half after the collapse of former communist east germany , the berlin-based east german stasi archive hardly raises a ripple of interest within the country with the exceptions of the disclosure of sensitive files belonging to high-ranking politicians . but overseas , particularly in countries trying to come to terms with their own totalitarian pasts , the archive 's know-how and categorization methods in shedding light on millions of files maintained by the stasi - east germany 's secret police - are considered invaluable . in recent years , six former soviet bloc countries - romania , slovakia , bulgaria , poland , the czech republic and hungary - have used the east german archive to confront their own brutal pasts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive in germany " coming to terms with east germany 's communist dictatorship has set standards for other states in dealing with their own communist pasts , " marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the east german stasi archive told news magazine spiegel . file legislation model for eastern europe set up in 1990 to investigate the biggest espionage system in history - more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under stasi observation - the archive faced a colossal logistical challenge . though the stasi shredded thousands of files detailing their network of spies and informers in the run-up to the collapse of the governmnet on november 9 , 1989 , millions more were found bound in massive sacks or strewn around the secret service 's offices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piles of stasi files in the stasi archive in erfurt , eastern germany .
in 1991 , the german parliament passed a unique law regulating the access to files for both victims of spying and former spies .
the law allows people who were spied upon to view their dossiers .
they can find out who spied on them , but to prevent recriminations and revenge-taking , they are not given access to the spy 's files . this legal framework , especially , has served as a model for lawmakers in the former communist eastern european countries .
poland , the czech republic and hungary have all passed similar laws opening up secret service files in their countries ' in the 1990s and have been coordinating with the stasi archive to prosecute members of the communist regime . argentina hopes to learn from stasi archive the east german archive 's work is now generating interest even beyond european borders .
christian booss , the stasi archive 's spokesman confirmed that argentina , iraq and south africa - all struggling with their own past dictatorships - are hoping to take a page out of the archive 's book . at the same time , booss added that the stasi archive 's role was to simply share its experience .
" all we do is explain our work , answer questions .
we 're no experts who want to export our model worldwide , " booss told dw-world .
" it 's more like we 're offering our services , we 're advisors . " last december , argentinean nobel prize winner adolfo pèrez esquivel , who runs the argentinean memory commission in buenos aires , paid a visit to the stasi archive in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former argentine dictator gen. leopoldo galtieri , who was arrested in buenos aires on july 11 , 2002 .
though it was only last summer that argentina lifted the amnesty laws that had protected the generals responsible for crimes during the military dictatorship that lasted from 1974 to 1983 , the stasi archive has promised to aid buenos aires .
together with two foundations , the argentineans will now study the german method of dealing with the espionage files . " we could learn from the germans " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
a similar cooperation is planned with iraq , which suffered under the brutal reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes . earlier this year , hasan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans are very methodic and very stringent on questions of privacy .
we could pick up a lot from them , " meneimneh said . germany 's foreign ministry is now planning to set aside funds for helping iraqis come to terms with their past . booss however warns that the countries seeking help should first " secure their files , pass clear legislation and ensure the work is independent of day-to-day politics . "
however , he admitted , " unfortunately these conditions do n't exist in all the countries .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .
the jury faced with picking the winners from this very mixed bag of 18 entries is headed by quirky american director , quentin tarantino -lrb- photo -rrb- , meaning an offbeat movie could well scoop the palme d 'or .
in 1994 , the cannes jury gave the top prize " pulp fiction , " the film that helped turn tarantino into a household name . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german directors open the hollywood blockbuster season hollywood 's silly season of summer blockbusters kicks of this month with two movies tipped as mega-buck earners leading the way .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .
-lrb- may 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .
mai 2002 , in der vestas rotorblatt-fabrik im brandenburgischen lauchhammer mit dem modell einer windkraftanlage der firma .
am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .

but critics of germany 's ambitious nuclear phase-out law say the country still needs atomic energy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.05.2004 german finance minister faces " week of truth " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constant bad news about the economy has isolated eichel finance minister hans eichel is under intense pressure ahead of the release of tax estimates that will likely reveal a massive budget shortfall and lead to another violation of the eu stability pact . thursday is likely not a day hans eichel is looking forward to since a government-led tax panel 's official tax revenue forecasts are released on that day .
they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .

-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 opinion : exploiting inhumanity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a video showing nick berg being killed was put online tuesday the beheading of an american man in iraq and circulation of the video on the internet marks a new low in the public exploitation of violence . the pictures are becoming ever more unbearable : first the abused iraqi prisoners , now the young american beheaded on camera .
or the photographs of iraqi children shot in the back by british soldiers .
or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there .

closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .

a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea .

the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2004 wind energy : more than hot air ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills generate 6 percent of germany 's energy so far germany generates more wind energy than any other country , but the renewable power source is not without its critics .
a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .

am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .

-lrb- april 4 , 2004 -rrb- germany starts nuclear energy phase-out germany 's future is looking a lot greener with the closure of the stade nuclear reactor power plant on friday .

or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .

of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .

new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 12.05.2004 german finance minister faces " week of truth " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : constant bad news about the economy has isolated eichel finance minister hans eichel is under intense pressure ahead of the release of tax estimates that will likely reveal a massive budget shortfall and lead to another violation of the eu stability pact . thursday is likely not a day hans eichel is looking forward to since a government-led tax panel 's official tax revenue forecasts are released on that day .
they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .
-lrb- may 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .
-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .
-lrb- may 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .
-lrb- april 27 , 2004 -rrb- german economic think-tanks predict low growth for 2004 six top german institutes published their latest forecasts for economic growth on tuesday , predicting that the biggest economy in the 12-country euro zone would only grow by 1.5 percent in 2004 .

not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .

of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .

it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .

or the photographs of iraqi children shot in the back by british soldiers .
or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.05.2004 wind energy : more than hot air ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills generate 6 percent of germany 's energy so far germany generates more wind energy than any other country , but the renewable power source is not without its critics .
a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .
mai 2002 , in der vestas rotorblatt-fabrik im brandenburgischen lauchhammer mit dem modell einer windkraftanlage der firma .
am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .

the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

a star-studded cannes film festival opened on wednesday with 18 entries vying for the palme d 'or .
among them is a german film - the first to compete at cannes in 11 years . the organizers of the cannes film festival needed to generate some serious buzz around the proceedings - last year 's event was widely panned as being one of the most lackluster in the festival 's history .
they appear to have hit the mark .
this year , an extra dash of glamour is being added by the presence of a-list hollywood actors such as brad pitt , tom hanks , and charlize theron .
there 's also a varied line-up of films , ranging from mainstream crowd-pleasers such as " shrek 2 " to more controversial offerings , such as michael moore 's new documentary , " fahrenheit 911 . " a german comeback but in germany , the entry generating a little buzz of its own among cinema buffs is the film " happy days are gone , " by director hans weingartner .
its inclusion ends an 11-year absence of german films at cannes .
even more spectacular would be if the austro-german coproduction , which tells the story of three teenagers trying to bring about social change in their town , were to take home cannes ' top honor , the palme d 'or .
but weingartner told deutsche welle that winning the coveted prize is the last thing on his mind . " i 'm not hung up on prizes and awards , " he said .
" my next film could totally bomb , and in that case , i 'd have to try not to go down with it , just as i now have to try to not totally flip out .
the best way to do that is just to concentrate on my work , and not be influenced by other things .
but i hope that we 'll be able to sell the film around the world , so that lots of people will get the chance to see it .
i 'm not thinking about the prize at all .
for me , it 's already a huge achievement that it 's even in the competition . " still , the director , who made a name for himself with his first film , " the white sound , " conceded that success at cannes could spark a renewal in german cinema .
it helps that the star of " happy days are gone " is daniel brühl , who also starred in last year 's internationally acclaimed german film , " good-bye lenin . " " i think germany 's got a new , fresh kind of cinema - the kind of films that tend to do well at festivals , " weingartner said .
" with new , digital techniques , it 's much cheaper to make films now , so it 's easier to make unconventional films . " fostering new talent weingartner is among many other new filmmakers on this year 's list at cannes - a departure from past years where entries have typically been the products of more seasoned directors .
cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , said the organizers wanted to introduce some new blood with the addition of hot , young newcomers .
as a result , he said the chosen films are " as varied as imaginable . " " there is nothing to compare between them , if nothing other than a very strong direction resulting in strong stylistic differences , " said fremaux . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american director quentin tarantino , president of the cannes film festival jury .

a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .

am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .

or the photographs of iraqi children shot in the back by british soldiers .
or jubilant palestinians in gaza holding in their hands body parts of dead israeli soldiers . it feels like we 've been transported back to the middle ages , despite the geneva convention , despite the declaration of human rights and despite numerous other international conventions . inhumanity is being exploited .
not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .

not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .

of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .

it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .

not to promote the war or to decide it , but to serve political aims .
or at least alleged political aims .
regardless of what aims it serves , however , inhumanity is an inadmissible instrument .
it was long ago stigmatized as reprehensible , unethical and immoral .
but it has n't been eradicated .
and using new technologies , from digital cameras to video recordings to the internet , such inhumanity will become an inexpensive weapon . not new al qaeda adherents kidnapped u.s. journalist daniel pearl in karachi and beheaded him on camera in 2002 .
a young italian man 's kidnappers filmed shooting him in april , and now we have the video of the american nick berg being beheaded in iraq .
of course , barbarity is n't a new invention .
but publicizing it throughout the world gives it more weight and power than in the past . the deeds and their glorification as ostensible " executions " - a word that even the western media adopted much too quickly and carelessly - is meant to show that resistance to u.s. or western superiority is unbroken .
just as the bloody scenes in gaza are meant to show that resistance to israel continues unchanged and that the opponent purported to be so powerful is also just made of bits of skin and bone . appealing to baseness such a strategy is horrendous as well as being dangerous .
it appeals to the baser human instincts and encourages imitation .
it also encourages the opposite side to clamp down more resolutely .
just after the united states had become enmeshed in an argument about torture in iraq that was as bitter as it was necessary , the pictures of the young american being beheaded will close the rift between the disputing parties .
consequently , the issue of torture may be pursued less energetically than it had - much too late - to start with . the iraqis will again be the ones to suffer , or the palestinians , or the muslims in general - the people those who know no better in the west allege " are like that , " who you ca n't approach with humaneness .
and under the influence of their demagogues , those people who suffer will more easily believe that the west is out to persecute and repress them .
new fools , madmen and criminals will more easily emerge who render the sense of inferiority into new violence . to stop the spiraling violence , people on both sides of this imaginary " front " must finally recognize that they themselves suffer most when they obey the demagogues .
they must recognize they have the most to gain if they recall the basic rules of humanity , avenge and punish crimes , and , thus , put a stop to both the torturers and the cold-blooded killers . peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .
-lrb- may 3 , 2004 -rrb- germany set to violate eu deficit rules in 2005 according to leading economic institutes , germany 's deficit will surpass 3 percent next year , meaning that the euro zone 's biggest economy is on the verge of breaching the stability and growth pact for the fourth year .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2004 poland says no easy answer on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland 's problems with the constitution have n't been solved yet .
the future of the draft constitution for the eu largely depends on how poland responds to compromise suggestions on the issue of voting rights , but the polish government says compromise wo n't be easy . the european union still does n't have a draft text of its new constitution , and that 's largely due to polish intransigence on the issue of voting rights in the enlarged bloc .
the last eu summit in brussels - aimed at hammering out the text of the new document - collapsed after spain and poland fought to hang on to the disproportionate voting weight it won under the 2000 nice treaty .
under that agreement , both spain and poland got 27 votes , compared to 29 for germany , whose population is bigger than that of the two countries combined .
since then , the new pro-european spanish government has signalled its acceptance of the new " double majority " voting system proposed in the draft charter , which says most decisions should be taken by a majority of member states representing 60 percent of the bloc 's population .
so all eyes are now on poland to see how willing it is to compromise with brussels now that it 's an official eu member .
constitution deal in sight in an interview with deutsche welle , polish foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said although poland has n't ruled out acceptance of the double majority system , it still wants a system closer to the nice treaty .
he said poland will consider whatever compromise solution the irish government puts forward at the next eu summit in june .
" we still believe that it 's possible to have the issue resolved by the end of june , before the irish presidency expires , " said cimoszewicz .
" but i also do n't want to create the illusion that it 's going to be easy , or that the problem is already solved - it is n't . "
cimoszewicz added that poland will likely hold a referendum on the eu constitution , though in order to guarantee the 50 percent voter participation needed for the result to be valid , he said the referendum would probably be held along with presidential elections in the fall of 2005 .
" that could mean that debate about domestic matters gets mixed up with debate about the constitution , " he warned . "
while it may not be the best solution , it 's the most practical solution to guarantee a valid result . "
staying the course in iraq the eu constitution is just one of the issues that has made poland the subject of keen observation among many of the old eu member states .
poland has also been facing questions on the future of its peacekeeping mission in iraq following the pullout of spanish troops .
poland , which defied large eu states such as france and germany to become a staunch supporter of the u.s.-led war in iraq , has about 2,400 troops in iraq and commands a multinational force in a south-central part of the country .
despite flagging public support among poles for their country 's involvement in iraq , cimoszewicz said the polish government is n't considering bringing its soldiers home .
" we decided to send troops for very important reasons , " he said .
" it was very important for the quality of our transatlantic relations , for our own security strategy , and for the future of iraqis .
and nothing has changed there . " reconciliation with germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , and his polish counterpart wlodzimierz cimoszewicz , left , embrace at midnight to may 1 , 2004 on the bridge between frankfurt / oder and slubice in poland .
closer to home , poland is looking for ways to improve relations with its neighbor germany .
on the eve of enlargement , cimoszewicz embraced his german counterpart , joschka fischer , on the bridge linking the polish town of slubice with frankfurt-an-der-oder on the german side .
the gesture was meant to mark the end of animosities that have tainted relations in the border region in the decades following nazi germany 's invasion of poland in 1939 .
but old prejudices persist , especially among the older generations .
people living in the region admit there 's not much cross-border contact .
that 's something cimoszewicz hopes to change .
" everyone in germany and poland who has contributed somehow to the reconciliation between our nations in the last few years needs to stand up to the extremists on both sides , and show them that those views wo n't be tolerated anymore . "
cimoszewicz said .
cimoszewicz stressed the importance of interaction between the young germans and poles , who are less burdened by the past .
he added that he and fischer are in agreement that there should be sponsored dialogues at least twice a year where journalists , academics , young people , and other groups of citizens are invited to discuss a range of topics , and in this way , forge closer ties . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany embraces its eastern neighbors in the eastern german town of zittau , leaders from germany , poland and the czech republic gathered to celebrate the removal of borders separating neighbors .

a trade fair focuses in hamburg on the subject . windenergy2004 opened in hamburg with a gust of fresh air .
more than 330 firms from 18 countries traveled to the northern german city to hawk their wares at the international fair , which runs until friday .
now in its second year , some 15,000 visitors are expected to attend the event as the subject of wind energy takes central stage in political discussions in germany . the german government has high hopes for the industry : it says the branch will spawn more than 10,000 new jobs in coming years .
a study showed that 66 percent of germans think wind energy is good .
but both government and environmentalists may just have been putting on a brave face in the wake of a passionate dispute over the benefits of wind energy that preoccupied the german media last month . even so , new legislation on the renewable energy source is expected to give the industry a boost .
although germany generates far more wind energy than any other country in the world , there currently are n't any windmills in german waters .
but the reworked renewable energy law is supposed to change that , cutting financial backing for windmills on land in favor of windmills in the sea . " with installations in the sea , we could triple the amount of wind energy in germany , from 5 to 15 percent , " greenpeace energy expert sven teske said in hamburg . filling the gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wind power turbines tower over the village of klettwitz in brandenburg , germany the governing social democratic-green party coalition decided years ago that renewable energy was the way of the future .
in 2002 , germany passed legislation to phase out nuclear energy by 2020 .
the government agreed that renewable energy sources , particularly wind and solar power , should carry the slack . the sector brings in € 4.2 billion -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- yearly , and german windmills make up for 6 percent of german energy needs , according to the branch association vdma .
the government aims for it to grow to 12.5 by 2010 , environment ministry state secretary simone probst said . although germany remains the biggest market , wind energy firms are also being drawn to other european countries , north america , asia and australia , where demand is growing .
exports make up 23 percent of the branche 's profits , and the vdma estimated that the amount will increase to 60 or 70 percent . the bundesrat , germany 's upper chamber of parliament , is set to debate the amendments to the renewable energy law on friday .
though the bundestag has already passed the law , the bundesrat , dominated by the opposition conservative christian democratic union , could slow down its enactment . hot air ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder posiert am am mittwoch , 22 .

am mittwoch erfolgt die inbetriebnahme des neuen werkes , in dem in zukunft jaehrlich 900 rotorblaetter fuer windkraftanlagen produziert werden .
-lrb- ap photo / matthias rietschel -rrb- if passed , the legislation should also help to extinguish the fires of anger in april after the influential german newsmagazine der spiegel published a controversial title story that argued the cost of wind energy to the environment and taxpayers was far too high .
the law will likely put an end to the verspargelung der landschaft - turning the german countryside into asparagus fields - that citizens ' groups have sprung up to fight . the newsmagazine 's story reaped indignation from one of der spiegel 's own reporters , who , along with a colleague , had submitted a different , contrary article on wind energy to the hamburg weekly a year earlier but never saw it printed .
harald schumann quit his job at the magazine over the dispute and had his original article published by online newspaper netzzeitung.de to disprove allegations from der spiegel that he had done shoddy work .
schumann and gerd rosenkranz 's story told of a wind energy sector hampered by large energy firms trying to block competition and inaccurate claims that it cost taxpayers too much money . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu needs to go green as part of its obligations as a new eu member , estonia must increase its share of renewable energy .

they are likely to be grim reading . if predictions are correct , the estimates will say german tax receipts this year will fall some € 7.5 billion -lrb- $ 9 million -rrb- short of earlier predicted levels .
next year 's shortfall could rise to € 14 billion .
for hans eichel , who has the gargantuan task of keeping the country on a tight fiscal leash without choking growth , the numbers will not be good news . several newspapers have predicted the finance minister 's days are numbered . the weekly bild am sonntag quoted unnamed government sources as saying that schröder was already looking at possible replacements for eichel .
the conservative die welt said eichel was facing a " week of truth " and that the tax shortfall would leave his financial plans for europe 's largest economy in ruins . " that eichel will have to go has long been seen as certain in berlin , the only question is when , " the paper said in an editorial . deficit buster , again germany has been plagued by sluggish economic growth and high unemployment for several years , which have scuppered the finance minister 's plans to rein in spiraling budget deficits that threaten to break european union budget rules for the fourth year running in 2005 . the eu 's stability & growth pact mandates that countries which have adopted the euro keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
the strict rules , which were originally strongly backed by germany , are a way to bolster the euro and keep the currency stable . however , germany has breached the rules since 2002 , and over the weekend eichel admitted that the tax shortfall meant that it was possible it would be unable to stay under the deficit ceiling again in 2005 . course correction ? for some in germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens , busting the deficit rules is not such a bad thing and deep divisions have arisen in the coalition about how , or even if , to deal with the ballooning deficit . eichel , who falls into the camp of the strict budget hawks , has in the past found himself at loggerheads with members of both parties who say more state spending and higher deficits may be necessary to get the sluggish economy moving again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fritz kuhn , budget spokesman for the greens .
" it 's acceptable not to continue to reduce government spending in times of sluggish economy growth .
this will only worsen our growth problems which is entirely wrong in this situation , " said fritz kuhn -lrb- photo -rrb- , the budget spokesman for the greens . while the government has denied recent media reports that it is about to make a u-turn and abandon its attempts to rein in spending and maintain strict fiscal discipline , on tuesday social democrat party leader franz müntefering called on other european states to consider making changes in eu deficit rules that would take into consideration the economic states of various national economies . and on tuesday , eichel seemed to be softening his stance somewhat .
he told reporters in brussels where he is attending a meeting of fellow eu finance members that germany 's nascent recovery could stumble if the government makes further spending cuts to meet eu fiscal rules . " the recovery is not yet so robust that it may not collapse again , " eichel said .
" we must be careful not to create new problems by doing things at the wrong time . " hoping for growth eichel is hoping that a surge in economic growth next year can plug the yawning budget gap , but the country 's high unemployment is showing no signs of easing .
while some signs of an economic recovery have surfaced , the upturn appears to be slow and steady rather than spectacular . the country 's six leading economic research institutes have scaled back growth forecasts , predicting a rate of 1.5 percent for this year and next .
the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .

the organization for economic cooperation and development rolled the number back even further , saying on tuesday that the german economy may grow no more than 1.1 percent this year . there are few concrete details on what eichel will do if growth alone does not plug the budget hole , although the government is planning on doing away with an expensive home construction subsidy .
other reports say eichel wants to sell off some € 50 million in foreign loans to private banks . cabinet reshuffle denied despite the reports that schröder is already talking to possible replacements for eichel , the government is adamantly denying that it plans a cabinet shake up .
up to now , schröder is standing behind his finance minister , publicly at least . " a cabinet reshuffle is not planned , " government spokesman thomas steg told reporters .
" speculation about a cabinet reshuffle does not become more correct by being constantly repeated . " however , the chancellor is facing widespread discontent over his savings plans , which have included unpopular cuts in social benefits and changes in labor market rules .
in the face of a dozen european , state and local elections in the coming months , and a nearly unprecedented barrage of bad press over the past weeks , schröder finds himself under pressure to make some kind of change . the removal of one or several unpopular ministers is not outside the realm of possibility . kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin denies plans to spark growth with spending plagued with a deficit that could exceed € 18 billion , reports over the weekend suggested germany may abandon its goal of bringing its budget deficit below euro zone limits in 2005 to spark economic growth .

berlin 's experience in tackling east germany 's vast secret police files has sparked interest beyond europe .
former totalitarian nations argentina , iraq and south africa want to use it to deal with their own brutal pasts . a decade and a half after the collapse of former communist east germany , the berlin-based east german stasi archive hardly raises a ripple of interest within the country with the exceptions of the disclosure of sensitive files belonging to high-ranking politicians . but overseas , particularly in countries trying to come to terms with their own totalitarian pasts , the archive 's know-how and categorization methods in shedding light on millions of files maintained by the stasi - east germany 's secret police - are considered invaluable . in recent years , six former soviet bloc countries - romania , slovakia , bulgaria , poland , the czech republic and hungary - have used the east german archive to confront their own brutal pasts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , head of the stasi archive in germany " coming to terms with east germany 's communist dictatorship has set standards for other states in dealing with their own communist pasts , " marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , head of the east german stasi archive told news magazine spiegel . file legislation model for eastern europe set up in 1990 to investigate the biggest espionage system in history - more than 2.4 million people are reported to have been placed under stasi observation - the archive faced a colossal logistical challenge . though the stasi shredded thousands of files detailing their network of spies and informers in the run-up to the collapse of the governmnet on november 9 , 1989 , millions more were found bound in massive sacks or strewn around the secret service 's offices . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piles of stasi files in the stasi archive in erfurt , eastern germany .
in 1991 , the german parliament passed a unique law regulating the access to files for both victims of spying and former spies .
the law allows people who were spied upon to view their dossiers .
they can find out who spied on them , but to prevent recriminations and revenge-taking , they are not given access to the spy 's files . this legal framework , especially , has served as a model for lawmakers in the former communist eastern european countries .
poland , the czech republic and hungary have all passed similar laws opening up secret service files in their countries ' in the 1990s and have been coordinating with the stasi archive to prosecute members of the communist regime . argentina hopes to learn from stasi archive the east german archive 's work is now generating interest even beyond european borders .
christian booss , the stasi archive 's spokesman confirmed that argentina , iraq and south africa - all struggling with their own past dictatorships - are hoping to take a page out of the archive 's book . at the same time , booss added that the stasi archive 's role was to simply share its experience .
" all we do is explain our work , answer questions .
we 're no experts who want to export our model worldwide , " booss told dw-world .
" it 's more like we 're offering our services , we 're advisors . " last december , argentinean nobel prize winner adolfo pèrez esquivel , who runs the argentinean memory commission in buenos aires , paid a visit to the stasi archive in berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former argentine dictator gen. leopoldo galtieri , who was arrested in buenos aires on july 11 , 2002 .
though it was only last summer that argentina lifted the amnesty laws that had protected the generals responsible for crimes during the military dictatorship that lasted from 1974 to 1983 , the stasi archive has promised to aid buenos aires .
together with two foundations , the argentineans will now study the german method of dealing with the espionage files . " we could learn from the germans " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
a similar cooperation is planned with iraq , which suffered under the brutal reign of former dictator saddam hussein .
like the east german regime , saddam ’ s baath party maintained a vast archive of an estimated 300 million to 400 million documents , which many believe hold the key to the regime ’ s undocumented crimes . earlier this year , hasan mneimneh , director of the washington-based iraq memory foundation told dw-world iraqis could benefit from learning more about germany 's experience .
" germans are very methodic and very stringent on questions of privacy .
we could pick up a lot from them , " meneimneh said . germany 's foreign ministry is now planning to set aside funds for helping iraqis come to terms with their past . booss however warns that the countries seeking help should first " secure their files , pass clear legislation and ensure the work is independent of day-to-day politics . "
however , he admitted , " unfortunately these conditions do n't exist in all the countries .

the centre , which houses police , fire and ambulance staff under one roof , was officially opened last june .
but plans to merge all seven of the county-based fire service control rooms in the south west are now under consideration by the government .
gloucester 's mp and fire chief will meet the minister nick raynsford to talk over these proposals .
large-scale emergencies the government is considering the merger of the call centres into wider , " more efficient " regional units .
under the plan , fire services in dorset , wiltshire , gloucestershire , avon , somerset , devon and cornwall will be run from one control room .
the fire brigades union -lrb- fbu -rrb- has said the idea is ill-conceived and dangerous .
but supporters of the scheme argue local knowledge would be provided by new technology , and that a regional centre would give " greater resilience " for brigades when dealing with large-scale emergencies .
the region 's fire services are currently bidding to host the new control room .
the government has said if they can not agree , it will make the decision on the location .

from thursday , the airline will add a £ 5 -lrb- $ 8.80 -rrb- surcharge to return trip tickets and £ 2.50 to one-way tickets .
ba 's move comes alongside similar announcements from australia 's qantas and air new zealand .
the airlines said they had been forced to make the decision because of a 60 % rise in the price of jet fuel over the past year .
previously , us carriers continental and american airlines added a surcharge to their domestic fares .
under review crude oil prices hit 13-year highs of more than $ 40 a barrel earlier this month .
and on monday in new york , the benchmark light , sweet crude closed at $ 40.06 a barrel , its highest close since october 1990 .
no company could be expected to absorb those kinds of costs on their own geoff dixon , qantas chief executive latest oil price data ba share price ba said the £ 5 / £ 2.50 fuel surcharge would apply to tickets bought in the uk for international flights .
in markets outside the uk , a surcharge of $ 4 will be added to ba tickets .
britain 's biggest airline said : " due to the continuing fluctuations in the price of oil , british airways will review this surcharge on a regular basis with a view to adjusting it when appropriate . "
qantas said it would add six australian dollars -lrb- £ 2.30 ; us $ 4.20 -rrb- to the price of domestic flights and a $ 15 to international tickets .

dr adrian rogers , who owns fishing rights on a stretch of the exe , near exeter , wants to start a campaign to save the species on the river .
he is blaming net fishing in the sea for putting pressure of salmon numbers .
ten years ago , rod fishermen on the river caught 1,611 salmon in total , but last year took only 143 .

he added : " there is concern among the rod fishing fraternity .

he accepted the main problem was netting in the north sea , but added : " for those salmon who do make it back to the exe , the greatest killing ground is at the village of topsham . "
dr rogers said that at that location last year , net fishermen took 277 fish , compared with 473 in 2002 .
action plan with the environment agency having no powers to ban netting , or plans to stock the exe , he hoped the licensed netsmen would voluntarily cease their activity .
he called on local people not to buy or eat fresh exe salmon .
" at least until successful measures have been taken to stop netting at sea , or properly stock the river with fish , netting should cease , and rod fishermen like myself may well have to practise catch and release every time , " he added .
the environment agency said the risk of over-exploitation of salmon by net fishing had been identified in an action plan for the exe .
the agency is reviewing a net limitation order and expected shortly to begin consultation , with recommendations to put before the department for food and rural affairs by september .

by bill wilson bbc news online business reporter liverpool could be seen as a " national club side " in thailand in the brave new world of billionaire football owners and " galactico " star-players , international marketing clout increasingly plays as important a role as what happens on the pitch .
as manchester united and real madrid have discovered , there is a huge audience in the far east eager to be associated with top-flight european clubs and stars .
liverpool , despite being a romantic , historic , and well-thought-of brand name , has seen itself fall behind in the high-powered world of overseas brand awareness , where others have been increasingly stealing a march .
the main reason for manchester united 's financial dominance in the uk is its huge fan base in the far east , where it is estimated the club has nearly 17 million supporters .
and part of the lure of david beckham for real madrid last summer was the enormous appeal he had to asian supporters .
it would be hugely advantageous if they -lrb- liverpool -rrb- were to receive this money without problems or complications vinay bedi , wise speke now liverpool is hoping to increase its presence and sales in that part of the world , with news that thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra is hoping to clinch a deal to buy a 30 % stake in the club .
there is a counter-offer from liverpool-born construction magnate steve morgan , who has promised £ 73m investment , but the thai premier has indicated he will not increase his £ 60m offer .
it is not yet clear whether any thai money would come from his personal fortune or government coffers - but it could help kick-start a new far east adventure for the club .
although the source of any funding remains hazy , analysts , brand experts , and academics are all agreed it provides the merseyside outfit with a great opportunity to improve both its on and off-field fortunes , although the two are linked .
' falling behind ' michael stirling is head of pricing strategies , as part of the sports analysis team , at law firm field fisher waterhouse .
he said : " there are two types of top teams in the modern game .
there are those like real madrid , chelsea and manchester united who push their brand by buying quality players .
" and there are clubs who do n't have access to the same amounts of funds , but have the skills , expertise and facilities still to compete on and off the field .
a club such as arsenal has these qualities and has made a few select buys for the future .
never walk alone ?
liverpool 's ceo rick parry and thaksin shinawatra " liverpool is falling outside this top bracket for two reasons ; people want results now without having to wait for team development , and also the premiership has become about much more than " football " .
" it is about excitement , image , high-profile players , and marketing strategies .
liverpool have not moved with the times and need to be much more dynamic off the pitch .
" the £ 60m will not bring liverpool up to manchester united or real madrid 's level , and thailand is not the biggest market .
" however , this deal may be the first step towards a more dynamic approach and a restructuring both in terms of acquiring football ability and a higher brand profile . "
' star-driven market ' lauren henderson , director of brand analytics at futurebrand , agrees there is work for liverpool to do in terms of catching their rivals .
she said : " the job for liverpool now is to try and step up to level of manchester united in far east , and see how much they can make from its brand in terms of shirt sales and perhaps sponsorship .
" one of the main driver of sales in the far east is through star players , and , although liverpool have michael owen , the money will allow them to bring in other big-name players and so increase their asian presence . "
liverpool 's michael owen : marketable asset in the far east whether liverpool will be allowed the luxury to use their thai windfall merely to buy a big-name star for boosting off-field activities , is debatable .
as anthony grimes , a marketing lecturer at university of hull specialising in football , observes : " in today 's premiership they need the money to be able to compete for third and fourth place , and a shot at champions league football , never mind first place .
" the money might also be needed to help them with their move to a new stadium across stanley park . "
' merchandising push ' however mr grimes sees a marketing potential if it is thai government money , and not private cash , used in the deal .
" manchester united and real madrid have shown that there are marvellous marketing opportunities in the far east .
" liverpool has one million supporters in thailand , and this could raise their profile even further and give an extra push to their merchandising .
" if it is thai government money that is being used , it could lead to the nation as a whole identifying with liverpool - it will become the club of the country , which increases marketing opportunities further .
" if they are successful on the playing field , there could be a cross-over in sales to other neighbouring countries and liverpool could be seen as a standard bearer for asian football . "
however , as football analyst vinay bedi from wise speke points out : " they can only do so much off the field without winning trophies , which is something they need to start doing again . "
and he warns : " it would be hugely advantageous if they were to receive this money without problems or complications . "

by bill wilson bbc news online business reporter liverpool could be seen as a " national club side " in thailand in the brave new world of billionaire football owners and " galactico " star-players , international marketing clout increasingly plays as important a role as what happens on the pitch .
as manchester united and real madrid have discovered , there is a huge audience in the far east eager to be associated with top-flight european clubs and stars .
liverpool , despite being a romantic , historic , and well-thought-of brand name , has seen itself fall behind in the high-powered world of overseas brand awareness , where others have been increasingly stealing a march .
the main reason for manchester united 's financial dominance in the uk is its huge fan base in the far east , where it is estimated the club has nearly 17 million supporters .
and part of the lure of david beckham for real madrid last summer was the enormous appeal he had to asian supporters .
it would be hugely advantageous if they -lrb- liverpool -rrb- were to receive this money without problems or complications vinay bedi , wise speke now liverpool is hoping to increase its presence and sales in that part of the world , with news that thai prime minister thaksin shinawatra is hoping to clinch a deal to buy a 30 % stake in the club .
there is a counter-offer from liverpool-born construction magnate steve morgan , who has promised £ 73m investment , but the thai premier has indicated he will not increase his £ 60m offer .
it is not yet clear whether any thai money would come from his personal fortune or government coffers - but it could help kick-start a new far east adventure for the club .
although the source of any funding remains hazy , analysts , brand experts , and academics are all agreed it provides the merseyside outfit with a great opportunity to improve both its on and off-field fortunes , although the two are linked .
' falling behind ' michael stirling is head of pricing strategies , as part of the sports analysis team , at law firm field fisher waterhouse .
he said : " there are two types of top teams in the modern game .
there are those like real madrid , chelsea and manchester united who push their brand by buying quality players .
" and there are clubs who do n't have access to the same amounts of funds , but have the skills , expertise and facilities still to compete on and off the field .
a club such as arsenal has these qualities and has made a few select buys for the future .
never walk alone ?
liverpool 's ceo rick parry and thaksin shinawatra " liverpool is falling outside this top bracket for two reasons ; people want results now without having to wait for team development , and also the premiership has become about much more than " football " .
" it is about excitement , image , high-profile players , and marketing strategies .
liverpool have not moved with the times and need to be much more dynamic off the pitch .
" the £ 60m will not bring liverpool up to manchester united or real madrid 's level , and thailand is not the biggest market .
" however , this deal may be the first step towards a more dynamic approach and a restructuring both in terms of acquiring football ability and a higher brand profile . "
' star-driven market ' lauren henderson , director of brand analytics at futurebrand , agrees there is work for liverpool to do in terms of catching their rivals .
she said : " the job for liverpool now is to try and step up to level of manchester united in far east , and see how much they can make from its brand in terms of shirt sales and perhaps sponsorship .
" one of the main driver of sales in the far east is through star players , and , although liverpool have michael owen , the money will allow them to bring in other big-name players and so increase their asian presence . "
liverpool 's michael owen : marketable asset in the far east whether liverpool will be allowed the luxury to use their thai windfall merely to buy a big-name star for boosting off-field activities , is debatable .
as anthony grimes , a marketing lecturer at university of hull specialising in football , observes : " in today 's premiership they need the money to be able to compete for third and fourth place , and a shot at champions league football , never mind first place .
" the money might also be needed to help them with their move to a new stadium across stanley park . "
' merchandising push ' however mr grimes sees a marketing potential if it is thai government money , and not private cash , used in the deal .
" manchester united and real madrid have shown that there are marvellous marketing opportunities in the far east .
" liverpool has one million supporters in thailand , and this could raise their profile even further and give an extra push to their merchandising .
" if it is thai government money that is being used , it could lead to the nation as a whole identifying with liverpool - it will become the club of the country , which increases marketing opportunities further .
" if they are successful on the playing field , there could be a cross-over in sales to other neighbouring countries and liverpool could be seen as a standard bearer for asian football . "
however , as football analyst vinay bedi from wise speke points out : " they can only do so much off the field without winning trophies , which is something they need to start doing again . "

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- is china 's economic miracle in meltdown ?

analysis by mary hennock bbc news online business reporter construction projects are pushing up steel and cement prices world leaders seldom stand up to dish the dirt on their country 's economy .
but china 's premier wen jiabao has been doing just that on his european tour this week , warning that china 's roaring juggernaut of an economy risks coming off the rails after growing 9.1 % last year .
at dinner with 400 uk executives in london , mr wen compared himself to the driver of a speeding car , trying to avoid an emergency stop .
" we can not slam the brakes , we have to press the brakes gently , " he said .
in brussels , he was even more blunt , triggering headlines by describing aspects of china 's growth as " excessive " .
change of tone in his dark business suit , sober tie and lacquered hair , mr wen looked the textbook example of china 's new post-mao , pro-market leaders .
but his admission that china is " overheating " comes as something of a break from communist party traditions of celebrating ever-increasing output of everything from pigs to microprocessors .
mr wen says better co-ordinated growth is a priority so what has sparked mr wen 's warnings ?
and how has china switched so swiftly from being a miracle growth story , the darling of international bankers and businesses , to a potential meltdown ?
reckless investment in new factories by state firms which borrow from banks that operate minimal credit checks and are wide open to pressure from local officials is nothing new , but the focus on stopping it is .
premier wen and president hu jintao are relatively new at the top , having inherited the two most powerful government posts in march 2003 .
foreign economists agree with the new leadership 's economic medicine .
but they are nervous about the consequences .
morgan stanley chief economist stephen roach wrote that a slowdown in china 's economy " should be viewed as a global event " .
investment cutbacks could " spread well beyond asia " , he said .
the asian giant is the world 's sixth largest economy and fourth biggest exporter ; the us ran a trade deficit with china of $ 124bn -lrb- £ 70bn -rrb- last year .
china 's appetite for raw materials has pushed up prices worldwide , and factory gate prices at home .
in 2003 , china consumed 27 % of world steel , 31 % of coal and 40 % of cement .
since october 2001 , the economist all-items index of commodity prices has risen 59 % , with metal prices jumping 50 % and industrial raw materials 73 % .
factory glut " china 's biggest problem " , said mr wen in london , is " excess growth in fixed asset investment " - in other words , too many factories and a real estate bubble that has sucked in raw materials and gridlocked the transport system , where rising prices hurt everyone .
officials face pressure to generate jobs " we are now under pressure of inflation , " admitted mr wen .
overall inflation rose by a manageable 2.8 % in the first quarter of 2004 , but factory gate prices jumped by roughly 7 % , he said .
mr wen 's confessional openness was aimed at wooing western investors with a transparent , responsible image , whilst issuing a warning back home .
investors certainly loved it .
" he comes across as a very deep-thinking person , " said peter nightingale , chief executive of the china-britain business council .
social reforms but china 's economic reformers may find themselves stranded without either a sufficiently developed market mechanism or enough old-style centrist clout to tackle overheating .
the trouble is that much reckless investment is being carried out by local officials who firmly believe they are doing what beijing wants .
or who do not care .
allan zhang was an economist at china 's foreign trade ministry for 14 years before joining audit firm pricewaterhouse coopers in london , where he heads the china business centre .
he points out that chinese officials focus on beefing up local growth rates because " you 're more likely to be promoted " .
" the central government is trying to cool down the economy , but that conflicts with local government officials who 're keen to develop their economies , " he explains .
" the local officials , basically they are paid by the local province . so the finance is not directly from the central coffers , " he said .
" those local governments ... have their own agenda " .
viewed this way , the bureaucracy needs reform as much as the economy .
a slowdown in china can hurt world trade but there is little sign of a long-term rethink in the way chinese officials are rewarded , says mr zhang .
to curb overheating , regulators have produced a blizzard of edicts in the last fortnight , and made a few high profile arrests .
shocked banking executives were ordered to suspend all new lending for a week ahead of the may day holiday , a move that unnerved foreign investors too .
the state council has ordered firms wanting to build steel projects to find 40 % of the cost .
banks have been warned they face inspections of their loans .
after years of chipping away price controls , the state development and reform commission announced caps on utility prices .
local inflation will trigger a three month freeze on investment .
and officials behind the new tieben steel project in jiangsu province have been arrested , apparently for breaching land-use laws .
banking on change at the centre of these measures is an attempt to get banks to apply credit rules .
but banks face pressure from local officials who want to preserve jobs and social stability - another goal shared by beijing .
china 's banks are technically insolvent , with bad debts making up 45 % of their loans , according to standard & poor 's .
better banks are central to china 's future , and beijing is trying to toughen them up and open them to international investment .
one much-touted solution among foreign economists - higher interest rates - would hurt firms that do pay their debts , while increasing levels of bad debt .
it could also slow down the growth in consumer credit - a novelty in china - and beijing 's plans for consumer-led growth .
china 's new leadership has drawn up an ambitious agenda for economic reform , but reliance on state controls to make it work show how weak the market remains .
mr wen 's european tour has the feel of a political campaign .

analysis by mary hennock bbc news online business reporter construction projects are pushing up steel and cement prices world leaders seldom stand up to dish the dirt on their country 's economy .
but china 's premier wen jiabao has been doing just that on his european tour this week , warning that china 's roaring juggernaut of an economy risks coming off the rails after growing 9.1 % last year .
at dinner with 400 uk executives in london , mr wen compared himself to the driver of a speeding car , trying to avoid an emergency stop .
" we can not slam the brakes , we have to press the brakes gently , " he said .
in brussels , he was even more blunt , triggering headlines by describing aspects of china 's growth as " excessive " .
change of tone in his dark business suit , sober tie and lacquered hair , mr wen looked the textbook example of china 's new post-mao , pro-market leaders .
but his admission that china is " overheating " comes as something of a break from communist party traditions of celebrating ever-increasing output of everything from pigs to microprocessors .
mr wen says better co-ordinated growth is a priority so what has sparked mr wen 's warnings ?
and how has china switched so swiftly from being a miracle growth story , the darling of international bankers and businesses , to a potential meltdown ?
reckless investment in new factories by state firms which borrow from banks that operate minimal credit checks and are wide open to pressure from local officials is nothing new , but the focus on stopping it is .
premier wen and president hu jintao are relatively new at the top , having inherited the two most powerful government posts in march 2003 .
foreign economists agree with the new leadership 's economic medicine .
but they are nervous about the consequences .
morgan stanley chief economist stephen roach wrote that a slowdown in china 's economy " should be viewed as a global event " .
investment cutbacks could " spread well beyond asia " , he said .

analysis by mary hennock bbc news online business reporter world leaders seldom stand up to dish the dirt on their country 's economy .
but china 's premier wen jiabao has been doing just that on his european tour this week , warning that china 's roaring juggernaut of an economy risks coming off the rails after growing 9.1 % last year .
at dinner with 400 uk executives in london , mr wen compared himself to the driver of a speeding car , trying to avoid an emergency stop .
" we can not slam the brakes , we have to press the brakes gently , " he said .
in brussels , he was even more blunt , triggering headlines by describing aspects of china 's growth as " excessive " .
change of tone in his dark business suit , sober tie and lacquered hair , mr wen looked the textbook example of china 's new post-mao , pro-market leaders .
but his admission that china is " overheating " comes as something of a break from communist party traditions of celebrating ever-increasing output of everything from pigs to microprocessors .
so what has sparked mr wen 's warnings ?
and how has china switched so swiftly from being a miracle growth story , the darling of international bankers and businesses , to a potential meltdown ?
reckless investment in new factories by state firms which borrow from banks that operate minimal credit checks and are wide open to pressure from local officials is nothing new , but the focus on stopping it is .
premier wen and president hu jintao are relatively new at the top , having inherited the two most powerful government posts in march 2003 .
foreign economists agree with the new leadership 's economic medicine .
but they are nervous about the consequences .
morgan stanley chief economist stephen roach wrote that a slowdown in china 's economy " should be viewed as a global event " .
investment cutbacks could " spread well beyond asia " , he said .
the asian giant is the world 's sixth largest economy and fourth biggest exporter ; the us ran a trade deficit with china of $ 124bn -lrb- £ 70bn -rrb- last year .
china 's appetite for raw materials has pushed up prices worldwide , and factory gate prices at home .
in 2003 , china consumed 27 % of world steel , 31 % of coal and 40 % of cement .
since october 2001 , the economist all-items index of commodity prices has risen 59 % , with metal prices jumping 50 % and industrial raw materials 73 % .
factory glut " china 's biggest problem " , said mr wen in london , is " excess growth in fixed asset investment " - in other words , too many factories and a real estate bubble that has sucked in raw materials and gridlocked the transport system , where rising prices hurt everyone .
" we are now under pressure of inflation , " admitted mr wen .
overall inflation rose by a manageable 2.8 % in the first quarter of 2004 , but factory gate prices jumped by roughly 7 % , he said .
mr wen 's confessional openness was aimed at wooing western investors with a transparent , responsible image , whilst issuing a warning back home .
investors certainly loved it .
" he comes across as a very deep-thinking person , " said peter nightingale , chief executive of the china-britain business council .
social reforms but china 's economic reformers may find themselves stranded without either a sufficiently developed market mechanism or enough old-style centrist clout to tackle overheating .
the trouble is that much reckless investment is being carried out by local officials who firmly believe they are doing what beijing wants .
or who do not care .
allan zhang was an economist at china 's foreign trade ministry for 14 years before joining audit firm pricewaterhouse coopers in london , where he heads the china business centre .
he points out that chinese officials focus on beefing up local growth rates because " you 're more likely to be promoted " .
" the central government is trying to cool down the economy , but that conflicts with local government officials who 're keen to develop their economies , " he explains .
" the local officials , basically they are paid by the local province . so the finance is not directly from the central coffers , " he said .
" those local governments ... have their own agenda " .
viewed this way , the bureaucracy needs reform as much as the economy .
but there is little sign of a long-term rethink in the way chinese officials are rewarded , says mr zhang .
to curb overheating , regulators have produced a blizzard of edicts in the last fortnight , and made a few high profile arrests .
shocked banking executives were ordered to suspend all new lending for a week ahead of the may day holiday , a move that unnerved foreign investors too .
the state council has ordered firms wanting to build steel projects to find 40 % of the cost .
banks have been warned they face inspections of their loans .
after years of chipping away price controls , the state development and reform commission announced caps on utility prices .
local inflation will trigger a three month freeze on investment .
and officials behind the new tieben steel project in jiangsu province have been arrested , apparently for breaching land-use laws .
banking on change at the centre of these measures is an attempt to get banks to apply credit rules .
but banks face pressure from local officials who want to preserve jobs and social stability - another goal shared by beijing .

it could also slow down the growth in consumer credit - a novelty in china - and beijing 's plans for consumer-led growth .

the advert featured a photograph of a long-haired boy model wearing only a pair of baggy jeans and a necklace .
the advertising standards authority said the model 's gender was ambiguous and that the advert for armani 's junior range drew attention to his sexuality .
orthet ltd , which holds the brand 's licence , agreed to withdraw the advert .
' offensive ' the image , to promote armani 's junior childrenswear range , sparked 74 complaints to the agency after it appeared in a magazine .
some branded it " offensive " because it " sexualised children and encouraged them to emulate adults " , while others said it " exploited the child in the photo " or " could encourage paedophiles " .
after an investigation , the watchdog concluded that because the advert " sexualised the child " it was " likely to cause serious or widespread offence " .
it welcomed orthet 's decision to withdraw the advert but suggested the firm seek advice before advertising again .

the german car maker is to sell its 10.5 % stake in hyundai motor , and plans to set up a joint-venture engine plant and truck maker have been shelved .
hyundai said the aim was to " readjust their relationship to react to the rapidly changing global auto market . "
the decision ends weeks of speculation about the four-year-old relationship .
chorus of complaint the divorce is symptomatic of daimlerchrysler 's current strategic difficulties .
for some time now , the car maker - and particularly its chief executive , juergen schrempp - has faced a barrage of criticism over its international strategy .
the complaints date back to the 1998 merger between mercedes-benz and us chrysler , which many shareholders claimed was a mistake on the part of the german company .
in recent months , criticism has focused on asia , where daimlerchrysler last month said it would not bail out loss-making japanese unit mitsubishi .
going it alone hyundai is far more financially secure than mitsubishi , and is the leader in the south korean market , as well as increasingly successful abroad .
but it has fallen out with daimlerchrysler over the german company 's plans to invest in china in concert with a beijing-based firm .
the disagreement has raised questions over whether such alliances - a common feature of the car business - are a viable strategy in an increasingly globalised industry .
hyundai is reckoned unlikely to find an equivalent strategic partner , as most of the likely us and european firms are already established in the region .
instead , however , analysts say the firm - which also produces the kia brand - has the muscle to stand alone .
daimlerchrysler 's stake in the firm is reckoned to be worth almost $ 1bn -lrb- £ 570m -rrb- .

hyundai is reckoned unlikely to find an equivalent strategic partner , as most of the likely us and european firms are already established in the region .
instead , however , analysts say the firm - which also produces the kia brand - has the muscle to stand alone .
daimlerchrysler 's stake in the firm is reckoned to be worth almost $ 1bn -lrb- £ 570m -rrb- .

a new charity act will require independent schools to show they are meeting a public benefit test .
heads will be warned of the dangers of losing their charitable status at a conference organised by brighton college on wednesday .
they will also consider whether their charitable status is still justified .
' new public benefit test ' robert maas , tax partner of blackstone franks llp , is telling delegates : " i am here because one of the big advantages of being a charity is the exemption from tax . "
" i am sure you will not be surprised to hear that if a charity loses its charitable status the revenue will want to claw back the tax relief that has previously been given to the extent that the funds have not been used for charitable purposes . "
everybody should be concerned if there are children in underperforming schools " sir cyril taylor " although the advancement of education is still a charitable objective , it will have to be positively shown that a school meets a new public benefit test for it to be recognised as a charity . "
many independent schools already assist neighbouring state schools .
for example , eton college has a 2,000 metre international-standard rowing lake for shared use with other schools , colleges and community groups .
cheltenham ladies ' college allows maintained schools use of its ict facilities at no charge and pupils at malvern college , worcestershire run french and german language clubs for local school children .
but such schemes will have to become more widespread when the new charity act comes into effect .
helping specialist schools sir cyril taylor , chairman of the specialist schools trust , will urge independent school heads at the conference to sponsor new city academies and specialist schools .
" we want to build upon what is already happening - there are a whole raft of ways of doing this , " sir cyril told bbc news online .
" everybody should be concerned if there are children in underperforming schools .
it 's everybody 's responsibility to help change that .
" we want to see an inclusive education sector . "
the education secretary , charles clarke , is also due to address the conference .
anthony seldon , the head of brighton college , said the gap which had existed between the state and independent sector was closing .
" what has become clear is that the damaging educational apartheid that has existed in this country for 100 years , where neither sector really engages with the other , is coming to an end and i am full of hope that having the education secretary address independent heads will usher in a new age of co-operation , " he said .
