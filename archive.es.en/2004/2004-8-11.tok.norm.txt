the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .

the countries are soon expected to sign a bilateral agreement on international investment , and a german-libyan economic forum is planned for november that will bring business and political leaders from both countries together in tripoli , the libyan capital .
anda said schröder plans to visit libya soon as a result of the deal .

the deal came after german and libyan negotiators met this week for a new round of talks on compensating people hurt in the 1986 bombing .
the settlement had been seen as vital to establishing libya 's place in the diplomatic fold .
the last round of negotiations , which have been held intermittently for about a year , ended without success in july .
attack targeted us soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen search through debris after the bomb attack .
the bombing at the " la belle " discotheque , which was frequented by us servicemen , in then-west berlin killed two gis and a turkish woman and wounded more than 250 people .
former us president ronald reagan immediately blamed libya and ordered air strikes on its capital , tripoli .
the american victims and their families are still negotiating a separate settlement with the libyans .
in 2001 , a german court sentenced four people to up to 14 years in prison and ruled that libya was partially responsible for the attack .
tripoli has never accepted blame .
the gadhafi foundation , chaired by libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's son saif al-islam , offered last august to compensate the victims , but differences remained until tuesday over the payouts for the wounded and for the family of the woman killed .

but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies . then called german southwest africa , namibia was a german colony between 1884 and 1915 .
tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .
11 , 2004 , in what came to be known as the decisive battle of warterberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops prepare to put down the herero rebellion in 1904 .
during the fight , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death , from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed .
german general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described his policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " guerrilla warfare that october , the nama , another ethnic tribe , declared guerrilla war against the germans .
the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .
thousands died in the mayhem , and the survivors were locked in concentration camps .
women and children were forced to work in the building of ports and railways . outraged german missionaries who visited namibia at the time spoke of inhumane conditions and of inmates " dropping like poisoned flies " under the strains of forced labor . the horror first ended when germany was forced to hand over namibia to south africa after its defeat in world war i.

" healing the wounds of the past " despite the attempts to overcome the divisions of the past , the reconciliation process has been marred by a lawsuit filed by the herero people 's reparation corporation in the us .
it seeks $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation and shipping company deutsche afrika linie , all of which allegedly profited from germany 's occupation of namibia . the german government has refused to consider any compensation claims , pointing to its role as development aid provider in namibia , as proof of its commitment to mend fences . earlier this month germany 's ambassador to namibia , wolfgang massing , said the lawsuit would amount to naught .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.08.2004 court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' neighbors do n't want this runway to grow any longer a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .
the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .

" to date , there is no evidence that funds from the non-targeted eu direct budget assistance to the palestinian authorities have been used to finance illegal activities , including terrorism , " the office said . olaf worked closely together with the world bank and the international monetary fund , which disburses eu funds in the occupied territories , as well as with palestinian and israeli authorities during the investigation . " investigation will go on " on tuesday olaf stressed that the enquiry was still ongoing and final conclusions could not be drawn as yet . " the investigation will go on and that 's why every funding drive will be thoroughly examined , " it said .

fatah detainees in israeli prison had previously told the media that they received financial support from the palestinian authority and were given instructions from senior security service officials on carrying out attacks on israelis .
biggest donor in occupied territories the eu was financing the palestinian authority 's payrolls of 125,000 employees but suspended it at the end of 2002 after israel accused the palestinians of a misuse of eu funds .
funding was continued after a working group at the european parliament concluded there was no evidence for the financing of illegal activities such as terrorism by taxpayers in the eu .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .

" to date , there is no evidence that funds from the non-targeted eu direct budget assistance to the palestinian authorities have been used to finance illegal activities , including terrorism , " the office said . olaf worked closely together with the world bank and the international monetary fund , which disburses eu funds in the occupied territories , as well as with palestinian and israeli authorities during the investigation . " investigation will go on " on tuesday olaf stressed that the enquiry was still ongoing and final conclusions could not be drawn as yet .

fatah detainees in israeli prison had previously told the media that they received financial support from the palestinian authority and were given instructions from senior security service officials on carrying out attacks on israelis .
biggest donor in occupied territories the eu was financing the palestinian authority 's payrolls of 125,000 employees but suspended it at the end of 2002 after israel accused the palestinians of a misuse of eu funds .
funding was continued after a working group at the european parliament concluded there was no evidence for the financing of illegal activities such as terrorism by taxpayers in the eu .

according to the embassy , chief negotiator said abdulaati said libya was prepared to make compensation payments in the case totaling $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.4 million -rrb- .
of that , $ 1 million would go to the family of a turkish woman killed in the bombing .
the remaining money would go to the 164 mostly german survivors of the attack , with the denominations of each settlement to be determined by the severity of the injury .
move will improve berlin-tripoli relations on tuesday night , the office of german chancellor gerhard schröder greeted the deal , saying it would " make possible the further expansion and strengthening of german-libyan relations . "
schröder 's spokesman , béla anda , said : " the federal government and german businesses are ready to support libya in the modernization of its economy . "
the countries are soon expected to sign a bilateral agreement on international investment , and a german-libyan economic forum is planned for november that will bring business and political leaders from both countries together in tripoli , the libyan capital .
anda said schröder plans to visit libya soon as a result of the deal .

the last round of negotiations , which have been held intermittently for about a year , ended without success in july .

but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies . then called german southwest africa , namibia was a german colony between 1884 and 1915 .
tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .
11 , 2004 , in what came to be known as the decisive battle of warterberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops prepare to put down the herero rebellion in 1904 .
during the fight , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death , from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed .
german general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described his policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " guerrilla warfare that october , the nama , another ethnic tribe , declared guerrilla war against the germans .
the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .
thousands died in the mayhem , and the survivors were locked in concentration camps .
women and children were forced to work in the building of ports and railways . outraged german missionaries who visited namibia at the time spoke of inhumane conditions and of inmates " dropping like poisoned flies " under the strains of forced labor . the horror first ended when germany was forced to hand over namibia to south africa after its defeat in world war i. " a special responsibility " in recognition of a difficult colonial history with some shameful chapters , the german government has spoken of a " special responsibility " towards namibia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of a commercial street in the namibian capital of windhoek .
much of that has taken the form of development aid , with germany being namibia 's largest foreign aid donor .
berlin has pumped more than € 500 million into namibia since the country gained independence from south africa in 1990 .
most of it has been used for development and culture programs . this week germany will send its first senior government official to namibia .
in a symbolic act on saturday , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul will remember the victims of the waterberg massacre together with representatives of the herero in okakarara , the scene of the battle .
the german minister will also inaugurate a cultural and tourism center built with german aid funds . " healing the wounds of the past " despite the attempts to overcome the divisions of the past , the reconciliation process has been marred by a lawsuit filed by the herero people 's reparation corporation in the us .
it seeks $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation and shipping company deutsche afrika linie , all of which allegedly profited from germany 's occupation of namibia . the german government has refused to consider any compensation claims , pointing to its role as development aid provider in namibia , as proof of its commitment to mend fences . earlier this month germany 's ambassador to namibia , wolfgang massing , said the lawsuit would amount to naught .
" it will not lead to any results .
while it is necessary to remember the past , we should move forward together and find projects that will heal the wounds of the past . " apology awaited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of herero people celebrate herero day in okahandja .
the day is celebrated on the first sunday after august 23 every year .
but the ancestors of the herero insist on compensation as well as a public apology from berlin , just as other countries did for the crimes of the nazi era . " it was genocide , " herero tribal leader kuaima riruako told news agency dpa .
" we were massacred and our land , our cattle , our culture was seized . "
riruako added that the demand for reparation was an attempt to " restore our dignity and get back what was taken away unfairly from us . " so far german leaders have skirted the issue of apologizing to namibia 's ethnic tribes .
in january this year , german ambassador massing regretted the brutal reaction of the german army to the herero uprising , but refused to react to allegations of genocide . the fact that germany has n't officially apologized has angered many innamibia .
" the germans have shown themselves as masters of racism , andthey lack respect for black people , " arnold tjihuiko , the chairman ofthe herero committee for memorial festivities , told the newsweekly der spiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.08.2004 court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' neighbors do n't want this runway to grow any longer a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .
the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .
a final ruling in the case is not expected for several years . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.08.2004 court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' neighbors do n't want this runway to grow any longer a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .
the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .
a final ruling in the case is not expected for several years . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

not mtv anyway . friss oder stirb -lrb- eat or die -rrb- is the catchy title of the new show , featuring germany 's very own punk legend , the toten hosen -lrb- dead pants -rrb- .
in a series of 22 half-hour episodes , fans and otherwise will have unprecedented access to the chaos that reigns in the lives and worlds of the five band members . in the show , campino , breiti , kuddel , andi and vom ritchie , as they are affectionately known to their disciples , will open the lid on just about every aspect of life as high-profile german punks . mtv is not only promising its viewers the chance to see their heroes in classic band situations , such as the recording studio or the tour bus , but is bating potential audiences with the rare opportunity of watching them try their hands at more conventional pastimes , such as horse-riding or golfing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lead singer of the toten hosen , campino never ones to shy away from a challenge , the chance of having their own tv show was too good a gig to pass up .
lead singer campino says the aim is to give a little insight into their lives , to document the chaos which surrounds them , and show how they deal with the music and television circus which constantly follows them - and of which they are about to become a part . with the only rule for the show being that there were no rules , the series promises to have that ' anything goes ' attitude which has characterized the toten hosen since their birth into the music world back in 1978 . the osbournes will be a hard act to follow , and whether friss oder stirb will do the same for the toten hosen as mtv reality tv appears to have done for ozzy and his clan remains to be seen . then again , if past experience is anything to go on , the success of such shows is not necessarily related to music or to the charismatic on-screen presence of the protagonists . it might just be a winner ... dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german reality shows in need of reality check reality shows are increasingly attracting the ire of critics - some who object to the way animals are treated on a new farm docu-soap , and others who worry about the effects such shows have on the human participants . -lrb- 20 july 2004 -rrb- the best of " and finally ...

according to the embassy , chief negotiator said abdulaati said libya was prepared to make compensation payments in the case totaling $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.4 million -rrb- .
of that , $ 1 million would go to the family of a turkish woman killed in the bombing .
the remaining money would go to the 164 mostly german survivors of the attack , with the denominations of each settlement to be determined by the severity of the injury .
move will improve berlin-tripoli relations on tuesday night , the office of german chancellor gerhard schröder greeted the deal , saying it would " make possible the further expansion and strengthening of german-libyan relations . "
schröder 's spokesman , béla anda , said : " the federal government and german businesses are ready to support libya in the modernization of its economy . "
the countries are soon expected to sign a bilateral agreement on international investment , and a german-libyan economic forum is planned for november that will bring business and political leaders from both countries together in tripoli , the libyan capital .
anda said schröder plans to visit libya soon as a result of the deal .

the deal came after german and libyan negotiators met this week for a new round of talks on compensating people hurt in the 1986 bombing .
the settlement had been seen as vital to establishing libya 's place in the diplomatic fold .
the last round of negotiations , which have been held intermittently for about a year , ended without success in july .

in 2001 , a german court sentenced four people to up to 14 years in prison and ruled that libya was partially responsible for the attack .
tripoli has never accepted blame .
the gadhafi foundation , chaired by libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's son saif al-islam , offered last august to compensate the victims , but differences remained until tuesday over the payouts for the wounded and for the family of the woman killed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.08.2004 a painful reminder of german colonialism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the herero want compensation and a public apology from germany wednesday marks the 100th anniversary of germany 's brutal crushing of an ethnic uprising in namibia .
but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies . then called german southwest africa , namibia was a german colony between 1884 and 1915 .
tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .
11 , 2004 , in what came to be known as the decisive battle of warterberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops prepare to put down the herero rebellion in 1904 .
during the fight , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death , from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed .
german general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described his policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " guerrilla warfare that october , the nama , another ethnic tribe , declared guerrilla war against the germans .
the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .
thousands died in the mayhem , and the survivors were locked in concentration camps .
women and children were forced to work in the building of ports and railways . outraged german missionaries who visited namibia at the time spoke of inhumane conditions and of inmates " dropping like poisoned flies " under the strains of forced labor . the horror first ended when germany was forced to hand over namibia to south africa after its defeat in world war i. " a special responsibility " in recognition of a difficult colonial history with some shameful chapters , the german government has spoken of a " special responsibility " towards namibia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of a commercial street in the namibian capital of windhoek .
much of that has taken the form of development aid , with germany being namibia 's largest foreign aid donor .
berlin has pumped more than € 500 million into namibia since the country gained independence from south africa in 1990 .
most of it has been used for development and culture programs . this week germany will send its first senior government official to namibia .
in a symbolic act on saturday , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul will remember the victims of the waterberg massacre together with representatives of the herero in okakarara , the scene of the battle .
the german minister will also inaugurate a cultural and tourism center built with german aid funds . " healing the wounds of the past " despite the attempts to overcome the divisions of the past , the reconciliation process has been marred by a lawsuit filed by the herero people 's reparation corporation in the us .
it seeks $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation and shipping company deutsche afrika linie , all of which allegedly profited from germany 's occupation of namibia . the german government has refused to consider any compensation claims , pointing to its role as development aid provider in namibia , as proof of its commitment to mend fences . earlier this month germany 's ambassador to namibia , wolfgang massing , said the lawsuit would amount to naught .
" it will not lead to any results .
while it is necessary to remember the past , we should move forward together and find projects that will heal the wounds of the past . " apology awaited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of herero people celebrate herero day in okahandja .
the day is celebrated on the first sunday after august 23 every year .
but the ancestors of the herero insist on compensation as well as a public apology from berlin , just as other countries did for the crimes of the nazi era . " it was genocide , " herero tribal leader kuaima riruako told news agency dpa .
" we were massacred and our land , our cattle , our culture was seized . "
riruako added that the demand for reparation was an attempt to " restore our dignity and get back what was taken away unfairly from us . " so far german leaders have skirted the issue of apologizing to namibia 's ethnic tribes .
in january this year , german ambassador massing regretted the brutal reaction of the german army to the herero uprising , but refused to react to allegations of genocide . the fact that germany has n't officially apologized has angered many innamibia .
" the germans have shown themselves as masters of racism , andthey lack respect for black people , " arnold tjihuiko , the chairman ofthe herero committee for memorial festivities , told the newsweekly der spiegel .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .

tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .

but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies . then called german southwest africa , namibia was a german colony between 1884 and 1915 .
tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .
11 , 2004 , in what came to be known as the decisive battle of warterberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops prepare to put down the herero rebellion in 1904 .
during the fight , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death , from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed .
german general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described his policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " guerrilla warfare that october , the nama , another ethnic tribe , declared guerrilla war against the germans .
the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .
thousands died in the mayhem , and the survivors were locked in concentration camps .
women and children were forced to work in the building of ports and railways . outraged german missionaries who visited namibia at the time spoke of inhumane conditions and of inmates " dropping like poisoned flies " under the strains of forced labor . the horror first ended when germany was forced to hand over namibia to south africa after its defeat in world war i. " a special responsibility " in recognition of a difficult colonial history with some shameful chapters , the german government has spoken of a " special responsibility " towards namibia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of a commercial street in the namibian capital of windhoek .
much of that has taken the form of development aid , with germany being namibia 's largest foreign aid donor .
berlin has pumped more than € 500 million into namibia since the country gained independence from south africa in 1990 .
most of it has been used for development and culture programs . this week germany will send its first senior government official to namibia .
in a symbolic act on saturday , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul will remember the victims of the waterberg massacre together with representatives of the herero in okakarara , the scene of the battle .
the german minister will also inaugurate a cultural and tourism center built with german aid funds . " healing the wounds of the past " despite the attempts to overcome the divisions of the past , the reconciliation process has been marred by a lawsuit filed by the herero people 's reparation corporation in the us .
it seeks $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation and shipping company deutsche afrika linie , all of which allegedly profited from germany 's occupation of namibia . the german government has refused to consider any compensation claims , pointing to its role as development aid provider in namibia , as proof of its commitment to mend fences . earlier this month germany 's ambassador to namibia , wolfgang massing , said the lawsuit would amount to naught .
" it will not lead to any results .
while it is necessary to remember the past , we should move forward together and find projects that will heal the wounds of the past . " apology awaited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of herero people celebrate herero day in okahandja .
the day is celebrated on the first sunday after august 23 every year .
but the ancestors of the herero insist on compensation as well as a public apology from berlin , just as other countries did for the crimes of the nazi era . " it was genocide , " herero tribal leader kuaima riruako told news agency dpa .
" we were massacred and our land , our cattle , our culture was seized . "
riruako added that the demand for reparation was an attempt to " restore our dignity and get back what was taken away unfairly from us . " so far german leaders have skirted the issue of apologizing to namibia 's ethnic tribes .
in january this year , german ambassador massing regretted the brutal reaction of the german army to the herero uprising , but refused to react to allegations of genocide . the fact that germany has n't officially apologized has angered many innamibia .
" the germans have shown themselves as masters of racism , andthey lack respect for black people , " arnold tjihuiko , the chairman ofthe herero committee for memorial festivities , told the newsweekly der spiegel .

but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies . then called german southwest africa , namibia was a german colony between 1884 and 1915 .
tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .
11 , 2004 , in what came to be known as the decisive battle of warterberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops prepare to put down the herero rebellion in 1904 .
during the fight , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death , from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed .
german general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described his policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " guerrilla warfare that october , the nama , another ethnic tribe , declared guerrilla war against the germans .
the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .
thousands died in the mayhem , and the survivors were locked in concentration camps .
women and children were forced to work in the building of ports and railways . outraged german missionaries who visited namibia at the time spoke of inhumane conditions and of inmates " dropping like poisoned flies " under the strains of forced labor . the horror first ended when germany was forced to hand over namibia to south africa after its defeat in world war i. " a special responsibility " in recognition of a difficult colonial history with some shameful chapters , the german government has spoken of a " special responsibility " towards namibia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of a commercial street in the namibian capital of windhoek .
much of that has taken the form of development aid , with germany being namibia 's largest foreign aid donor .
berlin has pumped more than € 500 million into namibia since the country gained independence from south africa in 1990 .
most of it has been used for development and culture programs . this week germany will send its first senior government official to namibia .
in a symbolic act on saturday , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul will remember the victims of the waterberg massacre together with representatives of the herero in okakarara , the scene of the battle .
the german minister will also inaugurate a cultural and tourism center built with german aid funds . " healing the wounds of the past " despite the attempts to overcome the divisions of the past , the reconciliation process has been marred by a lawsuit filed by the herero people 's reparation corporation in the us .
it seeks $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation and shipping company deutsche afrika linie , all of which allegedly profited from germany 's occupation of namibia . the german government has refused to consider any compensation claims , pointing to its role as development aid provider in namibia , as proof of its commitment to mend fences . earlier this month germany 's ambassador to namibia , wolfgang massing , said the lawsuit would amount to naught .
" it will not lead to any results .
while it is necessary to remember the past , we should move forward together and find projects that will heal the wounds of the past . " apology awaited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of herero people celebrate herero day in okahandja .
the day is celebrated on the first sunday after august 23 every year .
but the ancestors of the herero insist on compensation as well as a public apology from berlin , just as other countries did for the crimes of the nazi era . " it was genocide , " herero tribal leader kuaima riruako told news agency dpa .
" we were massacred and our land , our cattle , our culture was seized . "
riruako added that the demand for reparation was an attempt to " restore our dignity and get back what was taken away unfairly from us . " so far german leaders have skirted the issue of apologizing to namibia 's ethnic tribes .
in january this year , german ambassador massing regretted the brutal reaction of the german army to the herero uprising , but refused to react to allegations of genocide . the fact that germany has n't officially apologized has angered many innamibia .
" the germans have shown themselves as masters of racism , andthey lack respect for black people , " arnold tjihuiko , the chairman ofthe herero committee for memorial festivities , told the newsweekly der spiegel .

according to the embassy , chief negotiator said abdulaati said libya was prepared to make compensation payments in the case totaling $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.4 million -rrb- .
of that , $ 1 million would go to the family of a turkish woman killed in the bombing .
the remaining money would go to the 164 mostly german survivors of the attack , with the denominations of each settlement to be determined by the severity of the injury .
move will improve berlin-tripoli relations on tuesday night , the office of german chancellor gerhard schröder greeted the deal , saying it would " make possible the further expansion and strengthening of german-libyan relations . "
schröder 's spokesman , béla anda , said : " the federal government and german businesses are ready to support libya in the modernization of its economy . "
the countries are soon expected to sign a bilateral agreement on international investment , and a german-libyan economic forum is planned for november that will bring business and political leaders from both countries together in tripoli , the libyan capital .

according to the embassy , chief negotiator said abdulaati said libya was prepared to make compensation payments in the case totaling $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.4 million -rrb- .
of that , $ 1 million would go to the family of a turkish woman killed in the bombing .
the remaining money would go to the 164 mostly german survivors of the attack , with the denominations of each settlement to be determined by the severity of the injury .
move will improve berlin-tripoli relations on tuesday night , the office of german chancellor gerhard schröder greeted the deal , saying it would " make possible the further expansion and strengthening of german-libyan relations . "
schröder 's spokesman , béla anda , said : " the federal government and german businesses are ready to support libya in the modernization of its economy . "
the countries are soon expected to sign a bilateral agreement on international investment , and a german-libyan economic forum is planned for november that will bring business and political leaders from both countries together in tripoli , the libyan capital .
anda said schröder plans to visit libya soon as a result of the deal .

the countries are soon expected to sign a bilateral agreement on international investment , and a german-libyan economic forum is planned for november that will bring business and political leaders from both countries together in tripoli , the libyan capital .
anda said schröder plans to visit libya soon as a result of the deal .

the deal came after german and libyan negotiators met this week for a new round of talks on compensating people hurt in the 1986 bombing .
the settlement had been seen as vital to establishing libya 's place in the diplomatic fold .
the last round of negotiations , which have been held intermittently for about a year , ended without success in july .

tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .

but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies . then called german southwest africa , namibia was a german colony between 1884 and 1915 .
tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .
11 , 2004 , in what came to be known as the decisive battle of warterberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops prepare to put down the herero rebellion in 1904 .
during the fight , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death , from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed .
german general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described his policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " guerrilla warfare that october , the nama , another ethnic tribe , declared guerrilla war against the germans .
the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .
thousands died in the mayhem , and the survivors were locked in concentration camps .
women and children were forced to work in the building of ports and railways . outraged german missionaries who visited namibia at the time spoke of inhumane conditions and of inmates " dropping like poisoned flies " under the strains of forced labor . the horror first ended when germany was forced to hand over namibia to south africa after its defeat in world war i. " a special responsibility " in recognition of a difficult colonial history with some shameful chapters , the german government has spoken of a " special responsibility " towards namibia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of a commercial street in the namibian capital of windhoek .
much of that has taken the form of development aid , with germany being namibia 's largest foreign aid donor .
berlin has pumped more than € 500 million into namibia since the country gained independence from south africa in 1990 .
most of it has been used for development and culture programs . this week germany will send its first senior government official to namibia .
in a symbolic act on saturday , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul will remember the victims of the waterberg massacre together with representatives of the herero in okakarara , the scene of the battle .
the german minister will also inaugurate a cultural and tourism center built with german aid funds . " healing the wounds of the past " despite the attempts to overcome the divisions of the past , the reconciliation process has been marred by a lawsuit filed by the herero people 's reparation corporation in the us .
it seeks $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation and shipping company deutsche afrika linie , all of which allegedly profited from germany 's occupation of namibia . the german government has refused to consider any compensation claims , pointing to its role as development aid provider in namibia , as proof of its commitment to mend fences . earlier this month germany 's ambassador to namibia , wolfgang massing , said the lawsuit would amount to naught .

but the ancestors of the herero insist on compensation as well as a public apology from berlin , just as other countries did for the crimes of the nazi era . " it was genocide , " herero tribal leader kuaima riruako told news agency dpa .
" we were massacred and our land , our cattle , our culture was seized . "
riruako added that the demand for reparation was an attempt to " restore our dignity and get back what was taken away unfairly from us . " so far german leaders have skirted the issue of apologizing to namibia 's ethnic tribes .
in january this year , german ambassador massing regretted the brutal reaction of the german army to the herero uprising , but refused to react to allegations of genocide . the fact that germany has n't officially apologized has angered many innamibia .

but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies . then called german southwest africa , namibia was a german colony between 1884 and 1915 .
tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .
11 , 2004 , in what came to be known as the decisive battle of warterberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops prepare to put down the herero rebellion in 1904 .
during the fight , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death , from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed .
german general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described his policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " guerrilla warfare that october , the nama , another ethnic tribe , declared guerrilla war against the germans .
the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .
thousands died in the mayhem , and the survivors were locked in concentration camps .
women and children were forced to work in the building of ports and railways . outraged german missionaries who visited namibia at the time spoke of inhumane conditions and of inmates " dropping like poisoned flies " under the strains of forced labor . the horror first ended when germany was forced to hand over namibia to south africa after its defeat in world war i. " a special responsibility " in recognition of a difficult colonial history with some shameful chapters , the german government has spoken of a " special responsibility " towards namibia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a view of a commercial street in the namibian capital of windhoek .
much of that has taken the form of development aid , with germany being namibia 's largest foreign aid donor .
berlin has pumped more than € 500 million into namibia since the country gained independence from south africa in 1990 .
most of it has been used for development and culture programs . this week germany will send its first senior government official to namibia .
in a symbolic act on saturday , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul will remember the victims of the waterberg massacre together with representatives of the herero in okakarara , the scene of the battle .
the german minister will also inaugurate a cultural and tourism center built with german aid funds . " healing the wounds of the past " despite the attempts to overcome the divisions of the past , the reconciliation process has been marred by a lawsuit filed by the herero people 's reparation corporation in the us .
it seeks $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation and shipping company deutsche afrika linie , all of which allegedly profited from germany 's occupation of namibia . the german government has refused to consider any compensation claims , pointing to its role as development aid provider in namibia , as proof of its commitment to mend fences . earlier this month germany 's ambassador to namibia , wolfgang massing , said the lawsuit would amount to naught .
" it will not lead to any results .
while it is necessary to remember the past , we should move forward together and find projects that will heal the wounds of the past . " apology awaited bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of herero people celebrate herero day in okahandja .
the day is celebrated on the first sunday after august 23 every year .
but the ancestors of the herero insist on compensation as well as a public apology from berlin , just as other countries did for the crimes of the nazi era . " it was genocide , " herero tribal leader kuaima riruako told news agency dpa .
" we were massacred and our land , our cattle , our culture was seized . "
riruako added that the demand for reparation was an attempt to " restore our dignity and get back what was taken away unfairly from us . " so far german leaders have skirted the issue of apologizing to namibia 's ethnic tribes .
in january this year , german ambassador massing regretted the brutal reaction of the german army to the herero uprising , but refused to react to allegations of genocide . the fact that germany has n't officially apologized has angered many innamibia .
" the germans have shown themselves as masters of racism , andthey lack respect for black people , " arnold tjihuiko , the chairman ofthe herero committee for memorial festivities , told the newsweekly der spiegel .

but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies . then called german southwest africa , namibia was a german colony between 1884 and 1915 .
tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .

during the fight , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death , from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed .
german general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described his policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " guerrilla warfare that october , the nama , another ethnic tribe , declared guerrilla war against the germans .
the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .
thousands died in the mayhem , and the survivors were locked in concentration camps .
women and children were forced to work in the building of ports and railways . outraged german missionaries who visited namibia at the time spoke of inhumane conditions and of inmates " dropping like poisoned flies " under the strains of forced labor . the horror first ended when germany was forced to hand over namibia to south africa after its defeat in world war i.

it seeks $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation and shipping company deutsche afrika linie , all of which allegedly profited from germany 's occupation of namibia . the german government has refused to consider any compensation claims , pointing to its role as development aid provider in namibia , as proof of its commitment to mend fences . earlier this month germany 's ambassador to namibia , wolfgang massing , said the lawsuit would amount to naught .

" we were massacred and our land , our cattle , our culture was seized . "
riruako added that the demand for reparation was an attempt to " restore our dignity and get back what was taken away unfairly from us . " so far german leaders have skirted the issue of apologizing to namibia 's ethnic tribes .

according to the embassy , chief negotiator said abdulaati said libya was prepared to make compensation payments in the case totaling $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.4 million -rrb- .
of that , $ 1 million would go to the family of a turkish woman killed in the bombing .
the remaining money would go to the 164 mostly german survivors of the attack , with the denominations of each settlement to be determined by the severity of the injury .
move will improve berlin-tripoli relations on tuesday night , the office of german chancellor gerhard schröder greeted the deal , saying it would " make possible the further expansion and strengthening of german-libyan relations . "
schröder 's spokesman , béla anda , said : " the federal government and german businesses are ready to support libya in the modernization of its economy . "
the countries are soon expected to sign a bilateral agreement on international investment , and a german-libyan economic forum is planned for november that will bring business and political leaders from both countries together in tripoli , the libyan capital .
anda said schröder plans to visit libya soon as a result of the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard george , a former u.s. soldier and barkeeper in the west berlin discotheque " la belle " , one of the survivors of the bombing , is seen after the pronouncement of judgement of the la belle revision in leipzig , eastern germany , on june 24 , 2004 .
the deal came after german and libyan negotiators met this week for a new round of talks on compensating people hurt in the 1986 bombing .
the settlement had been seen as vital to establishing libya 's place in the diplomatic fold .
the last round of negotiations , which have been held intermittently for about a year , ended without success in july .
attack targeted us soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen search through debris after the bomb attack .
the bombing at the " la belle " discotheque , which was frequented by us servicemen , in then-west berlin killed two gis and a turkish woman and wounded more than 250 people .
former us president ronald reagan immediately blamed libya and ordered air strikes on its capital , tripoli .
the american victims and their families are still negotiating a separate settlement with the libyans .
in 2001 , a german court sentenced four people to up to 14 years in prison and ruled that libya was partially responsible for the attack .
tripoli has never accepted blame .
the gadhafi foundation , chaired by libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's son saif al-islam , offered last august to compensate the victims , but differences remained until tuesday over the payouts for the wounded and for the family of the woman killed .

" to date , there is no evidence that funds from the non-targeted eu direct budget assistance to the palestinian authorities have been used to finance illegal activities , including terrorism , " the office said . olaf worked closely together with the world bank and the international monetary fund , which disburses eu funds in the occupied territories , as well as with palestinian and israeli authorities during the investigation . " investigation will go on " on tuesday olaf stressed that the enquiry was still ongoing and final conclusions could not be drawn as yet . " the investigation will go on and that 's why every funding drive will be thoroughly examined , " it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat earlier this month the eu was planning to send investigators to israel to interview palestinians held in israeli prisons after claims that yasser arafat , the chairman of the palestinian authority , and senior officials transferred eu funds to the al aqsa martyrs ' brigades , the military wing of arafat 's fatah faction .
fatah detainees in israeli prison had previously told the media that they received financial support from the palestinian authority and were given instructions from senior security service officials on carrying out attacks on israelis .
biggest donor in occupied territories the eu was financing the palestinian authority 's payrolls of 125,000 employees but suspended it at the end of 2002 after israel accused the palestinians of a misuse of eu funds .
funding was continued after a working group at the european parliament concluded there was no evidence for the financing of illegal activities such as terrorism by taxpayers in the eu .

the eu is the most important donor for the palestinian authority .
in the past decade , it has transferred about € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- to the palestinian authority .
in july the european commission said that total aid to the palestinians in 2004 amounted to € 250 million . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for freezing palestinian aid amidst corruption allegations and a leadership crisis , a growing chorus of german politicians are calling for measures to be taken against the government of yasser arafat , including a freezing of european union aid .

" to date , there is no evidence that funds from the non-targeted eu direct budget assistance to the palestinian authorities have been used to finance illegal activities , including terrorism , " the office said . olaf worked closely together with the world bank and the international monetary fund , which disburses eu funds in the occupied territories , as well as with palestinian and israeli authorities during the investigation . " investigation will go on " on tuesday olaf stressed that the enquiry was still ongoing and final conclusions could not be drawn as yet . " the investigation will go on and that 's why every funding drive will be thoroughly examined , " it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat earlier this month the eu was planning to send investigators to israel to interview palestinians held in israeli prisons after claims that yasser arafat , the chairman of the palestinian authority , and senior officials transferred eu funds to the al aqsa martyrs ' brigades , the military wing of arafat 's fatah faction .
fatah detainees in israeli prison had previously told the media that they received financial support from the palestinian authority and were given instructions from senior security service officials on carrying out attacks on israelis .
biggest donor in occupied territories the eu was financing the palestinian authority 's payrolls of 125,000 employees but suspended it at the end of 2002 after israel accused the palestinians of a misuse of eu funds .
funding was continued after a working group at the european parliament concluded there was no evidence for the financing of illegal activities such as terrorism by taxpayers in the eu .

in the past decade , it has transferred about € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- to the palestinian authority .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.08.2004 eu : funds not used for palestinian terror großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are fears that eu funds are falling into the wrong hands following a preliminary investigation , the european union said tuesday it had found no evidence that donations to the palestinian authority had been misused to fund terrorist activities . in a statement in brussels on tuesday , olaf said there was no proof of that .
" to date , there is no evidence that funds from the non-targeted eu direct budget assistance to the palestinian authorities have been used to finance illegal activities , including terrorism , " the office said . olaf worked closely together with the world bank and the international monetary fund , which disburses eu funds in the occupied territories , as well as with palestinian and israeli authorities during the investigation . " investigation will go on " on tuesday olaf stressed that the enquiry was still ongoing and final conclusions could not be drawn as yet . " the investigation will go on and that 's why every funding drive will be thoroughly examined , " it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat earlier this month the eu was planning to send investigators to israel to interview palestinians held in israeli prisons after claims that yasser arafat , the chairman of the palestinian authority , and senior officials transferred eu funds to the al aqsa martyrs ' brigades , the military wing of arafat 's fatah faction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.08.2004 court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' neighbors do n't want this runway to grow any longer a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .
the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .

an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .

this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.08.2004 silent movies still have a voice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent movie-goers not only enjoy the peace and quiet , but fresh air as well bonn is currently playing host to the quietest film festival in europe .
for 11 days , silent movies dance and flicker across an open-air screen as curious cinema-goers flock to watch . big-budget hollywood blockbuster films may dominate popular culture , but the silent movies of yesteryear continue to work their quiet magic on surprisingly large audiences .
the international silent movie festival is part of an annual event called " summer cinema , " which has been taking place in the former west german capital of bonn for the past 20 years . although organizer stefan drössler did n't set out with the express purpose of creating a forum for silent films , his program now attracts tens of thousands of viewers . " my intention was to show films that no one would be likely to know , films which are not shown in normal cinemas , " drössler told deutsche welle . " and there are a lot of unknown silent movies . " aesthetic diversity drössler tries to keep the program as varied as possible in a conscious effort to dispel the notion among viewers that all silent movies belong to the same genre and were made in the same style .
he wants his program to reflect the " incredible expanse and diversity of means of expression " that he said existed in the golden era of silent movies in just the same way as it does today .
and to illustrate his point , he has created an event that packs avant-garde short films , animation and major-league features into an 11-day program . the bonn festival has become so well known that it has now inspired film historians from around the world to restore old film material for showcase at the event .
many silent movies have to be reconstructed and copied from their original nitrate film base to modern tape without losing color or depth of focus before they can be shown . " our aim is to always show the best copy of every film , rather than bad , wobbly images , " drössler explained , " because that is also one of the clichés which is associated with old films . " too subtle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live piano accompanies the movies but just how timeless are silent movies ?
do today 's modern audiences pick up the unspoken nuances ?
" i think the films are generally comprehensible .
the later silent movies in particular perfected the art of telling their stories in a purely visual way .
in fact , the introduction of audio was a step back aesthetically speaking .
the camera was n't free to move about so much because the story was no longer only told through images , but through the dialogue , " drössler said . silent movie actors speak through subheadings which are faded in and out , but moreover through live music that often accompanies the films when they are screened today .
the music determines their characters and the strength of what they are saying .

for 11 days , silent movies dance and flicker across an open-air screen as curious cinema-goers flock to watch . big-budget hollywood blockbuster films may dominate popular culture , but the silent movies of yesteryear continue to work their quiet magic on surprisingly large audiences .
the international silent movie festival is part of an annual event called " summer cinema , " which has been taking place in the former west german capital of bonn for the past 20 years . although organizer stefan drössler did n't set out with the express purpose of creating a forum for silent films , his program now attracts tens of thousands of viewers . " my intention was to show films that no one would be likely to know , films which are not shown in normal cinemas , " drössler told deutsche welle . " and there are a lot of unknown silent movies . " aesthetic diversity drössler tries to keep the program as varied as possible in a conscious effort to dispel the notion among viewers that all silent movies belong to the same genre and were made in the same style .
he wants his program to reflect the " incredible expanse and diversity of means of expression " that he said existed in the golden era of silent movies in just the same way as it does today .
and to illustrate his point , he has created an event that packs avant-garde short films , animation and major-league features into an 11-day program . the bonn festival has become so well known that it has now inspired film historians from around the world to restore old film material for showcase at the event .
many silent movies have to be reconstructed and copied from their original nitrate film base to modern tape without losing color or depth of focus before they can be shown . " our aim is to always show the best copy of every film , rather than bad , wobbly images , " drössler explained , " because that is also one of the clichés which is associated with old films . " too subtle ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : live piano accompanies the movies but just how timeless are silent movies ?
do today 's modern audiences pick up the unspoken nuances ?
" i think the films are generally comprehensible .
the later silent movies in particular perfected the art of telling their stories in a purely visual way .
in fact , the introduction of audio was a step back aesthetically speaking .
the camera was n't free to move about so much because the story was no longer only told through images , but through the dialogue , " drössler said . silent movie actors speak through subheadings which are faded in and out , but moreover through live music that often accompanies the films when they are screened today .
the music determines their characters and the strength of what they are saying .
pianist aljoscha zimmermann believes that good music leads viewers to forget about the absence of dialogue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.08.2004 us extends new passport deadline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting into the united states is already taking longer countries which have a visa waiver agreement with the united states have been granted an extra year before they have to start issuing biometric passports . washington had originally been planning to introduce the new passports , which are to include biometric features such as fingerprints , iris recognition or facial geometry at the end of october this year .
but the time scale was proving unrealistic , with many of the 27 countries affected - including germany and many other eu states - not ready to implement the new id system . under the present rules citizens from the 27 countries are generally allowed to visit the united states for up to 90 days without a visa , but as of 26 october 2005 , they will either have to have a new passport or will have to obtain a visa from the us authorities .
" if they do not have them they will be refused entry , " a u.s. official said . the issuing of biometric passports was prompted by the sept.11 terrorist attacks and fears that the current system makes it too easy for terrorists to gain access to the states by using stolen or forged eu passports . tough line remains however , the state department in washington has not extended this year 's deadline for the creation of machine-readable passports .
a press release stated that " all passports used for travel in the visa waiver program must be machine-readable " by this october .
failing that , visitors will be obliged to get a visa . from the end of september this year , the us authorities will tighten security controls at both airports and harbors , where they will take fingerprints and digital photographs of those traveling into the country from visa waiver states .
the policy already applies to most foreigners entering the states , and has already caused much anger among visitors . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. decides to fingerprint european travelers visitors from many european countries will now be photographed and fingerprinted when entering the united states .
officials say the measures are necessary , but tourism experts worry they will act as a deterrent .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .
a final ruling in the case is not expected for several years . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

according to the embassy , chief negotiator said abdulaati said libya was prepared to make compensation payments in the case totaling $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.4 million -rrb- .
of that , $ 1 million would go to the family of a turkish woman killed in the bombing .
the remaining money would go to the 164 mostly german survivors of the attack , with the denominations of each settlement to be determined by the severity of the injury .
move will improve berlin-tripoli relations on tuesday night , the office of german chancellor gerhard schröder greeted the deal , saying it would " make possible the further expansion and strengthening of german-libyan relations . "
schröder 's spokesman , béla anda , said : " the federal government and german businesses are ready to support libya in the modernization of its economy . "
the countries are soon expected to sign a bilateral agreement on international investment , and a german-libyan economic forum is planned for november that will bring business and political leaders from both countries together in tripoli , the libyan capital .
anda said schröder plans to visit libya soon as a result of the deal .

the deal came after german and libyan negotiators met this week for a new round of talks on compensating people hurt in the 1986 bombing .
the settlement had been seen as vital to establishing libya 's place in the diplomatic fold .
the last round of negotiations , which have been held intermittently for about a year , ended without success in july .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.08.2004 court puts brakes on airbus super jumbo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' neighbors do n't want this runway to grow any longer a german court has ordered airbus to halt construction of a runway at its assembly plant in hamburg .
the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .
a final ruling in the case is not expected for several years . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

" to date , there is no evidence that funds from the non-targeted eu direct budget assistance to the palestinian authorities have been used to finance illegal activities , including terrorism , " the office said . olaf worked closely together with the world bank and the international monetary fund , which disburses eu funds in the occupied territories , as well as with palestinian and israeli authorities during the investigation . " investigation will go on " on tuesday olaf stressed that the enquiry was still ongoing and final conclusions could not be drawn as yet . " the investigation will go on and that 's why every funding drive will be thoroughly examined , " it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat earlier this month the eu was planning to send investigators to israel to interview palestinians held in israeli prisons after claims that yasser arafat , the chairman of the palestinian authority , and senior officials transferred eu funds to the al aqsa martyrs ' brigades , the military wing of arafat 's fatah faction .
fatah detainees in israeli prison had previously told the media that they received financial support from the palestinian authority and were given instructions from senior security service officials on carrying out attacks on israelis .
biggest donor in occupied territories the eu was financing the palestinian authority 's payrolls of 125,000 employees but suspended it at the end of 2002 after israel accused the palestinians of a misuse of eu funds .
funding was continued after a working group at the european parliament concluded there was no evidence for the financing of illegal activities such as terrorism by taxpayers in the eu .

the eu is the most important donor for the palestinian authority .
in the past decade , it has transferred about € 1.5 billion -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- to the palestinian authority .
in july the european commission said that total aid to the palestinians in 2004 amounted to € 250 million . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german politicians call for freezing palestinian aid amidst corruption allegations and a leadership crisis , a growing chorus of german politicians are calling for measures to be taken against the government of yasser arafat , including a freezing of european union aid .

according to the embassy , chief negotiator said abdulaati said libya was prepared to make compensation payments in the case totaling $ 35 million -lrb- € 28.4 million -rrb- .
of that , $ 1 million would go to the family of a turkish woman killed in the bombing .
the remaining money would go to the 164 mostly german survivors of the attack , with the denominations of each settlement to be determined by the severity of the injury .
move will improve berlin-tripoli relations on tuesday night , the office of german chancellor gerhard schröder greeted the deal , saying it would " make possible the further expansion and strengthening of german-libyan relations . "
schröder 's spokesman , béla anda , said : " the federal government and german businesses are ready to support libya in the modernization of its economy . "
the countries are soon expected to sign a bilateral agreement on international investment , and a german-libyan economic forum is planned for november that will bring business and political leaders from both countries together in tripoli , the libyan capital .
anda said schröder plans to visit libya soon as a result of the deal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : richard george , a former u.s. soldier and barkeeper in the west berlin discotheque " la belle " , one of the survivors of the bombing , is seen after the pronouncement of judgement of the la belle revision in leipzig , eastern germany , on june 24 , 2004 .
the deal came after german and libyan negotiators met this week for a new round of talks on compensating people hurt in the 1986 bombing .
the settlement had been seen as vital to establishing libya 's place in the diplomatic fold .
the last round of negotiations , which have been held intermittently for about a year , ended without success in july .
attack targeted us soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen search through debris after the bomb attack .
the bombing at the " la belle " discotheque , which was frequented by us servicemen , in then-west berlin killed two gis and a turkish woman and wounded more than 250 people .
former us president ronald reagan immediately blamed libya and ordered air strikes on its capital , tripoli .
the american victims and their families are still negotiating a separate settlement with the libyans .
in 2001 , a german court sentenced four people to up to 14 years in prison and ruled that libya was partially responsible for the attack .
tripoli has never accepted blame .
the gadhafi foundation , chaired by libyan leader moammar gadhafi 's son saif al-islam , offered last august to compensate the victims , but differences remained until tuesday over the payouts for the wounded and for the family of the woman killed .

but reconciliation has been marred by a lawsuit filed by namibia 's ethnic herero people against german companies . then called german southwest africa , namibia was a german colony between 1884 and 1915 .
tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .
11 , 2004 , in what came to be known as the decisive battle of warterberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops prepare to put down the herero rebellion in 1904 .
during the fight , german soldiers are said to have forced the surviving herero into the omaheke desert and blocked access to all water sources .
thousands died a painful death , from starvation and thirst .
between 45,000 and 65,000 herero are believed to have been killed .
german general lothar von trotha said at the time he would " wipe them out with rivers of blood . "
historians have described his policy as one of " blatant terrorism " and " shocking brutality . " guerrilla warfare that october , the nama , another ethnic tribe , declared guerrilla war against the germans .
the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .
thousands died in the mayhem , and the survivors were locked in concentration camps .
women and children were forced to work in the building of ports and railways . outraged german missionaries who visited namibia at the time spoke of inhumane conditions and of inmates " dropping like poisoned flies " under the strains of forced labor . the horror first ended when germany was forced to hand over namibia to south africa after its defeat in world war i.

the german minister will also inaugurate a cultural and tourism center built with german aid funds . " healing the wounds of the past " despite the attempts to overcome the divisions of the past , the reconciliation process has been marred by a lawsuit filed by the herero people 's reparation corporation in the us .
it seeks $ 2 billion in damages from several german companies including deutsche bank , mining company terex corporation and shipping company deutsche afrika linie , all of which allegedly profited from germany 's occupation of namibia . the german government has refused to consider any compensation claims , pointing to its role as development aid provider in namibia , as proof of its commitment to mend fences . earlier this month germany 's ambassador to namibia , wolfgang massing , said the lawsuit would amount to naught .

" we were massacred and our land , our cattle , our culture was seized . "
riruako added that the demand for reparation was an attempt to " restore our dignity and get back what was taken away unfairly from us . " so far german leaders have skirted the issue of apologizing to namibia 's ethnic tribes .

the company says the decision could jeopardize its € 11.7 billion -lrb- $ 14.3 billion -rrb- a380 super jumbo jet project . in the weeks leading up to tuesday 's ruling by hamburg 's upper administrative court , airbus argued that a major extension of its existing runway is necessary for the testing of the cargo version of its ambitious new a380 super jumbo jet program , which is expected to hit the market in 2006 .
airbus officials fear the decision could harm the company 's future in germany and comes at a sensitive time for the program , which is expected to increase company revenues by € 6 billion annually .
both airbus and representatives of the hamburg government said they regretted the decision , but residents and environmental activists said they were relieved by the ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ' planned a380f cargo jet will be able to carry 150 tons of freight on three decks over a distance of 10,400 kilometers .
a spokesperson for the european company said wednesday the runway expansion was " urgently needed " in order for hamburg to hold its position as a major base for the cargo plane -lrb- photo -rrb- and other further developments of the a380 line .
airbus ceo gerhard puttfarcken said a ruling against airbus in the case could bring " considerable " negative consequences for the aviation industry in hamburg and germany .
the company said it would now pursue legal and political avenues to reverse the injunction .
hamburg 's mayor , ole van beust of the conservative christian democratic union , also criticized the decision .
" now we 're reviewing what we can do to actually make it possible for the freight version of the a380 to be assembled in hamburg , " he said .
court : expansion unjustified ten hamburg residents whose properties were threatened with expropriation as a result of the expansion sued in court to stop the project .
this week , the court issued a second injunction stating the runway could not be extended by the additional 589 meters -lrb- 644 yards -rrb- airbus had hoped for at its plant in the finkenwerder neighborhood .
tuesday 's ruling was the second in the case and followed a lower court injunction against the construction project on june 28 .
airbus has said it needs the additional runway space for its a380 cargo jets , which are heavier than the passenger version when loaded with freight and require 277 meters additional runway space for take off and landing .
the jet could take off and land on the company 's current 2,678 meter runway , but the company said a total length of 3,267 meters would be needed to demonstrate the plane at two-thirds of its freight capacity for customers .
however , the court expressed doubts about the decision made by local authorities to issue construction permits for the project , saying the authorities had failed to properly weigh the reasoning for the runway expansion against the damage expropriating the people of their property would cause .
in addition , the court stated , they had failed to explain what concrete steps would be needed to further lengthen the runway .
the court indicated the existence of ample evidence that the importance of the cargo a380 would n't be significant enough to justify stripping the locals of their property .
however , the court 's preliminary ruling did not question the validity of the overall a380 project , which will for the first time put airbus into direct competition with boeing 's 747 jumbo jet .
a380 a boon to german industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at airbus ' hamburg assembly hall for the a380 super jumbo will complete the first jet in 2005 .
for the construction of the a380 line , airbus has said it will add 2,000 new jobs in hamburg .
an additional 2,000 positions will be created in the region at companies that provide parts for the massive jet .
currently , airbus employs more than 8,000 at its hamburg assembly plant .
hamburg officials fear the decision could lead airbus to focus more on its second major manufacturing base in toulouse , france , which is already responsible for the assembly of its current line of long-haul jets .
a final ruling in the case is not expected for several years . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus , boeing duel at air show the world 's biggest aviation giants descended on europe 's largest air show on monday in farnborough , england , in a mood of optimism and a bit more than the usual dosage of fierce rivalry .

tensions between the ethnic herero people and the german rulers spilled over in january 1904 when herero warriors , seeking to revolt against their masters for suppressing them and seizing their land , killed around 200 german soldiers and settlers . the germans were sent arms and reinforcements by the emperor in berlin and lashed back on aug .

the germans reacted with merciless tactics including poisoning watering holes .

the software giant said the new system , named windows xp starter edition , would go on sale in asia in october .
the company said the cut-price software was designed for " first-time desktop pc users in developing countries " .
the move is seen as a response to linux , a free-to-use system with a strong following in poor countries .
competitive threat analysts say linux poses a growing threat to microsoft 's dominant windows operating system , used on more than 90 % of the world 's computers .
a so-called ' open source ' system which pc users can install on their machines and modify without paying a licence fee , linux has made significant inroads into the software market in latin america and asia .
earlier this year , computer giant hp began shipping computers equipped with linux to china and india .
linux is also championed by microsoft critics who say the firm 's dominance of the global software market makes computer systems more vulnerable to potentially disabling viruses .
microsoft 's new software - dubbed " xp lite " - will feature lower resolution graphics and limited options for networking computers together .
it will also limit users to running three programs concurrently - a far cry from the full version of xp , where the only practical limit comes from the speed of the computer and the size of its memory .
it will be available initially in thailand , malaysia , indonesia and two other as yet unspecified asian countries .
microsoft said it hoped the new software would also help deter consumers from buying pirated versions of its xp system , widely available in many asian countries .

the software giant said the new system , named windows xp starter edition , would go on sale in asia in october .
the company said the cut-price software was designed for " first-time desktop pc users in developing countries " .
the move is seen as a response to linux , a free-to-use system with a strong following in poor countries .
competitive threat analysts say linux poses a growing threat to microsoft 's dominant windows operating system , used on more than 90 % of the world 's computers .
a so-called ' open source ' system which pc users can install on their machines and modify without paying a licence fee , linux has made significant inroads into the software market in latin america and asia .
earlier this year , computer giant hp began shipping computers equipped with linux to china and india .
linux is also championed by microsoft critics who say the firm 's dominance of the global software market makes computer systems more vulnerable to potentially disabling viruses .
microsoft 's new software - dubbed " xp lite " - will feature lower resolution graphics and limited options for networking computers together .
it will also limit users to running three programs concurrently - a far cry from the full version of xp , where the only practical limit comes from the speed of the computer and the size of its memory .
it will be available initially in thailand , malaysia , indonesia and two other as yet unspecified asian countries .

four unions - representing about 1,800 employees - have joined forces to oppose the plans , which will also mean the introduction of water charges .
the new company is due to start operating in 18 months time and it is planned that within five years it will be financed entirely by new water charges .
however , the trade union , nipsa , has said its members may take industrial action to save the jobs threatened by the proposals .
nipsa 's assistant general secretary bumper graham said strike action could not be ruled out .
" if that means having to close the water service down for a week or two , to safeguard the long-term public provision of water , we will , " he said .
nio minister john spellar said on tuesday that the water service was to become a government owned company , or goco .
the change means crown immunity will no longer apply , leaving bosses open to court action if the service does not meet legal standards .
the government will own the majority of the shares in the company .
the changes will happen around april 2006 and will be accompanied by the start of water charges , although this will not be confirmed until the autumn .
but by 2008 the new company will have to be almost completely self-funding .
mr spellar said the new company was part of a process of making the system more efficient .
the minister said the concerns of staff must be addressed in the establishment of the goco .
mr spellar said water reform would ensure increased and sustained levels of investment in northern ireland 's water and sewerage services , without compromising the funding of other public services .
ofreg which regulates gas and electricity in northern ireland will also take on a new role as water regulator from 2006 .
the general consumer council said reform of the water service would have a direct impact on households in the province .
