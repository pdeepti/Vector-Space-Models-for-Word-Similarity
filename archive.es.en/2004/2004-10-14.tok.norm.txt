11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .

when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .

meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .

the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .

the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .

at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .

but they normally are n't chalked up to faulty translation equipment . according to the reuters news agency , when schröder 's earpiece failed at joint press conference after a summit in rome on wednesday , berlusconi looked at it and declared : " it 's a german machine . " schröder , who has clashed with berlusconi on many political issues , not least iraq , looked at the brand name , philips , smiled back at his host and replied : " dutch " . the bit reveals that despite all the talk of common currency , treaties and policy , european union leaders are not above a bit of nationalistic jibing .
especially these two . the german-italian relationship has undergone a rocky period in recent years .
after berlusconi suggested a german member of the european parliament was acting like a concentration camp guard , schröder broke off his annual italian vacation . after the snafu , both leaders then went on to say relations between two of europe 's biggest countries were excellent , despite opposed positions on the war in iraq and on the future reform of the united nations .
rome opposes berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council for fear of losing relative influence in europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

for 30 years , berz 's job has been to study meteorological and environmental climate changes for the world 's largest reinsurer .
his research helps munich re decide how to react in the marketplace .
while hurricanes , tropical storms and heat waves are known to the masses by charming names like " isabel " , " queenie " or " michaela " , in the insurance industry they are simply referred to as " basic damage events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forest fires caused millions in damages in portugal in july such weather-related natural catastrophes have caused $ 333 billion -lrb- € 271 billion -rrb- in damage in the past 10 years - six times more than 50 years ago .
and costs for insured damages have risen tenfold in the same time .
one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .
mankind to blame ?
but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic on highway in atlanta , georgia if industrial nations cut their greenhouse emissions , then developing nations will be able to expand theirs without causing an overall further imbalance .

in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .

in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .
" if you walk along the shopping boulevards you see the same thing everywhere .
people want to go somewhere to be entertained , to be treated to something special . " brands to the limit inside , levi ’ s and adidas have set up little shrines to their brand .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .

" to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement -lrb- about the future -rrb- . " the remarks had sparked an outcry among some members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the junior partner in the ruling coalition , the greens party . powell confused the remarks also prompted us secretary of state colin powell to pick up the phone and call german foreign minister joschka fischer to ask if there had been a change of position , said a us state department spokesman in washington . but struck , attending a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania wednesday , insisted there was no difference between his position and that of his chancellor . " that is mad , the chancellor and i are of one view and that is the way it stays , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defense secretary geoff hoon but in a further twist british defense secretary geoff hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed struck 's comments , which he said the german minister had repeated in the romanian ski resort of poiana brasov . " it was a very welcome observation , something that i would expect germany as a good conscientious ally to undertake , " hoon said .
" i do n't see that that should come as any great surprise to anyone . focus on training truck drivers " he set out a number of conditions but made clear that germany would want to play its part if appropriate in helping .
that is obviously something that we welcome , " hoon told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a us army base in iraq in july germany does plan to train hundreds of iraqi drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months . separately , the handelsblatt business daily reported that schröder 's foreign policy advisor bernd mützelburg had traveled to washington two and a half weeks ago and told the campaign team of democratic presidential candidate john kerry that germany would not send troops to iraq . no involvement under kerry , either the newspaper , citing government sources in an advance copy of its thursday issue , said berlin aimed to make it clear that regardless of the outcome of the us election on nov .
2 , it would maintain its " red lines " on iraq . " any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " the report quoted rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , as saying . in his financial times deutschland interview , however , struck indicated germany 's support for a proposal by kerry to convene an international conference on iraq . " this is a very sensible proposal , " he told the paper .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .
merkel calls for petition against turkish membership germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel has called for a petition to be drawn up against turkey 's membership of the european union and has advocated privileged partnership status as an alternative .

dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .

he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .

however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .

this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.10.2004 experts doubt success of far-right alliance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two far-right parties , one poster come elections in 2006 ?
a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .
" it will still not be enough for both together .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

for 30 years , berz 's job has been to study meteorological and environmental climate changes for the world 's largest reinsurer .
his research helps munich re decide how to react in the marketplace .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forest fires caused millions in damages in portugal in july such weather-related natural catastrophes have caused $ 333 billion -lrb- € 271 billion -rrb- in damage in the past 10 years - six times more than 50 years ago .
and costs for insured damages have risen tenfold in the same time .
one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .
mankind to blame ?
but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic on highway in atlanta , georgia if industrial nations cut their greenhouse emissions , then developing nations will be able to expand theirs without causing an overall further imbalance .
" the industrial nations have done most of the development to this point , and have also gained the most from it , " he said .

but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic on highway in atlanta , georgia if industrial nations cut their greenhouse emissions , then developing nations will be able to expand theirs without causing an overall further imbalance .
" the industrial nations have done most of the development to this point , and have also gained the most from it , " he said .
" so in my opinion , we should have the responsibility of doing everything in our power not to increase development , but to stabilize it .

dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .

however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .

for 30 years , berz 's job has been to study meteorological and environmental climate changes for the world 's largest reinsurer .
his research helps munich re decide how to react in the marketplace .
while hurricanes , tropical storms and heat waves are known to the masses by charming names like " isabel " , " queenie " or " michaela " , in the insurance industry they are simply referred to as " basic damage events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forest fires caused millions in damages in portugal in july such weather-related natural catastrophes have caused $ 333 billion -lrb- € 271 billion -rrb- in damage in the past 10 years - six times more than 50 years ago .
and costs for insured damages have risen tenfold in the same time .
one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .
mankind to blame ?
but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.10.2004 french lawmakers debate turkish eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac backs a referendum the french parliament is set for a heated debate on the controversial issue of turkey 's eu accession , an issue that divides french politicians and public alike . french president jacques chirac has been treading carefully on the sensitive issue of turkish accession to the european union . in december , european heads of state will meet in brussels to decide whether accession talks should begin ; the current german government is widely expected to vote for talks to start . but opinions are anything but united on the issue ; in france as well as germany , there has been talks of petition drives opposing the negotiations , and france even considered changing its constitution to allow a popular referendum on the issue . in recent days chirac has noted that turkey has been given the prospect of possible eu accession for years – and that prior commitments must be adhered to .
but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .
merkel calls for petition against turkish membership germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel has called for a petition to be drawn up against turkey 's membership of the european union and has advocated privileged partnership status as an alternative .

for 30 years , berz 's job has been to study meteorological and environmental climate changes for the world 's largest reinsurer .
his research helps munich re decide how to react in the marketplace .
while hurricanes , tropical storms and heat waves are known to the masses by charming names like " isabel " , " queenie " or " michaela " , in the insurance industry they are simply referred to as " basic damage events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forest fires caused millions in damages in portugal in july such weather-related natural catastrophes have caused $ 333 billion -lrb- € 271 billion -rrb- in damage in the past 10 years - six times more than 50 years ago .
and costs for insured damages have risen tenfold in the same time .
one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .
mankind to blame ?
but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .

but they normally are n't chalked up to faulty translation equipment . according to the reuters news agency , when schröder 's earpiece failed at joint press conference after a summit in rome on wednesday , berlusconi looked at it and declared : " it 's a german machine . " schröder , who has clashed with berlusconi on many political issues , not least iraq , looked at the brand name , philips , smiled back at his host and replied : " dutch " . the bit reveals that despite all the talk of common currency , treaties and policy , european union leaders are not above a bit of nationalistic jibing .
especially these two . the german-italian relationship has undergone a rocky period in recent years .
after berlusconi suggested a german member of the european parliament was acting like a concentration camp guard , schröder broke off his annual italian vacation . after the snafu , both leaders then went on to say relations between two of europe 's biggest countries were excellent , despite opposed positions on the war in iraq and on the future reform of the united nations .
rome opposes berlin 's bid for a permanent seat on the un security council for fear of losing relative influence in europe . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the company has a total european workforce of about 60,000 . the drastic measures were necessary to address the negative outlook for the european auto market , where demand for new cars was expected to remain sluggish , competition from other car makers - both european and asian - would likely increase and car prices fall in the coming years , gm europe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at opel 's rüsselsheim factory germany will be hit especially hard by the cuts : german car maker opel is to axe 10,000 jobs from a total workforce of 33,000 in germany by 2008 , rainer einenkel , the deputy worker 's council leader at opel 's plant in the western german town of bochum told reporters .
bochum and another plant in rüsselsheim will each lose about 4,000 jobs , he added . according to einenkel , 3,000 jobs will be cut in bochum in 2005 despite earlier reports that a job guarantee existed until 2006 . another 1,000 jobs will be cut by 2007 . no immediate plans to shut plants while gm europe chief fritz henderson said that there were no immediate plans to shut down any plants , as unions and politicians had initially feared , factory closures could not be ruled out altogether . opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , and the site in bochum in the heavy-industrialized ruhr region have been seen as the most likely targets for possible closure . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , where rüsselsheim is located said he was " deeply concerned " about the job cutting plans and urged gm to issue a guarantee that the rüsselsheim factory would not be shut down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch " it 's now about preventing the worst and limiting the damage , " koch -lrb- photo -rrb- said . in addition to opel , gm europe comprises vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden . the woes at opel were the reason why german economy minister wolfgang clement cancelled a planned meeting thursday with his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy at the last minute . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de up to 7,000 jobs threatened at opel german car maker opel , the loss-making subsidiary of general motors , is to axe 6,000-7,000 jobs from a total german workforce of around 12,000 , according to news reports .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 14.10.2004 distorting the us ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders is a long-time resident of los angeles in his lates movie , " land of plenty , " german director wim wenders takes a critical look at the us after the sept .
11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

" there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement -lrb- about the future -rrb- .

2 , it would maintain its " red lines " on iraq . " any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " the report quoted rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , as saying . in his financial times deutschland interview , however , struck indicated germany 's support for a proposal by kerry to convene an international conference on iraq . " this is a very sensible proposal , " he told the paper .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .

" to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement -lrb- about the future -rrb- . " the remarks had sparked an outcry among some members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the junior partner in the ruling coalition , the greens party . powell confused the remarks also prompted us secretary of state colin powell to pick up the phone and call german foreign minister joschka fischer to ask if there had been a change of position , said a us state department spokesman in washington . but struck , attending a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania wednesday , insisted there was no difference between his position and that of his chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 14.10.2004 distorting the us ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders is a long-time resident of los angeles in his lates movie , " land of plenty , " german director wim wenders takes a critical look at the us after the sept .
11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .

archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .
" if you walk along the shopping boulevards you see the same thing everywhere .
people want to go somewhere to be entertained , to be treated to something special . " brands to the limit inside , levi ’ s and adidas have set up little shrines to their brand .
if they want to , shoppers can buy a pair of € 500 -lrb- $ 613 -rrb- levi ’ s jeans dipped in gold leaf finish , only 100 pairs of which are available .
adidas offers limited edition shoes in a soccer-themed corner complete with a flat screen showing replays of world cups gone by . the motto of the brands is " limited and exclusive " - items bought in the pop-up store are not sold in normal stores .
german designers featured on mtv ’ s fashion showcase " designorama " offer original pieces sold only in the store .
and one of the most popular products this time around has been a sony ericsson phone that won ’ t be available in germany for another three months . “ that ’ s why i ’ m here , ” said patrick peiki , 36 , a stylishly-dressed local who organizes club events in cologne .
“ i like getting the tech stuff ahead of everyone else . ” a place for trend-setters to browse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pop-up store in germany shoppers milling around the store seemed to perfectly fit the profile of the type of people the brands are after .
schmieder spoke of reaching hip kids and “ opinion leaders ” - adspeak for people that spend money in order to set themselves apart from the masses .
though many browsed and tried on , they didn ’ t ultimately buy . “ i think the store is good in some ways , ” said frank schumann , 32 , an electrician .
“ and there are things here i ’ d like to buy .
but it ’ s also a bit expensive . ” those types of comments don ’ t bother the people behind the concept .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .
" it will still not be enough for both together .

now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .

for 30 years , berz 's job has been to study meteorological and environmental climate changes for the world 's largest reinsurer .
his research helps munich re decide how to react in the marketplace .
while hurricanes , tropical storms and heat waves are known to the masses by charming names like " isabel " , " queenie " or " michaela " , in the insurance industry they are simply referred to as " basic damage events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forest fires caused millions in damages in portugal in july such weather-related natural catastrophes have caused $ 333 billion -lrb- € 271 billion -rrb- in damage in the past 10 years - six times more than 50 years ago .
and costs for insured damages have risen tenfold in the same time .
one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .
mankind to blame ?
but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic on highway in atlanta , georgia if industrial nations cut their greenhouse emissions , then developing nations will be able to expand theirs without causing an overall further imbalance .
" the industrial nations have done most of the development to this point , and have also gained the most from it , " he said .

in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .
" if you walk along the shopping boulevards you see the same thing everywhere .

in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .
" if you walk along the shopping boulevards you see the same thing everywhere .
people want to go somewhere to be entertained , to be treated to something special . " brands to the limit inside , levi ’ s and adidas have set up little shrines to their brand .
if they want to , shoppers can buy a pair of € 500 -lrb- $ 613 -rrb- levi ’ s jeans dipped in gold leaf finish , only 100 pairs of which are available .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.10.2004 experts doubt success of far-right alliance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two far-right parties , one poster come elections in 2006 ?
a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .
" it will still not be enough for both together .

dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .

he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .

however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .

chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .

many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

but they normally are n't chalked up to faulty translation equipment . according to the reuters news agency , when schröder 's earpiece failed at joint press conference after a summit in rome on wednesday , berlusconi looked at it and declared : " it 's a german machine . " schröder , who has clashed with berlusconi on many political issues , not least iraq , looked at the brand name , philips , smiled back at his host and replied : " dutch " . the bit reveals that despite all the talk of common currency , treaties and policy , european union leaders are not above a bit of nationalistic jibing .
especially these two . the german-italian relationship has undergone a rocky period in recent years .
after berlusconi suggested a german member of the european parliament was acting like a concentration camp guard , schröder broke off his annual italian vacation . after the snafu , both leaders then went on to say relations between two of europe 's biggest countries were excellent , despite opposed positions on the war in iraq and on the future reform of the united nations .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .

" to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement -lrb- about the future -rrb- . " the remarks had sparked an outcry among some members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the junior partner in the ruling coalition , the greens party . powell confused the remarks also prompted us secretary of state colin powell to pick up the phone and call german foreign minister joschka fischer to ask if there had been a change of position , said a us state department spokesman in washington . but struck , attending a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania wednesday , insisted there was no difference between his position and that of his chancellor . " that is mad , the chancellor and i are of one view and that is the way it stays , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defense secretary geoff hoon but in a further twist british defense secretary geoff hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed struck 's comments , which he said the german minister had repeated in the romanian ski resort of poiana brasov . " it was a very welcome observation , something that i would expect germany as a good conscientious ally to undertake , " hoon said .
" i do n't see that that should come as any great surprise to anyone . focus on training truck drivers " he set out a number of conditions but made clear that germany would want to play its part if appropriate in helping .
that is obviously something that we welcome , " hoon told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a us army base in iraq in july germany does plan to train hundreds of iraqi drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months . separately , the handelsblatt business daily reported that schröder 's foreign policy advisor bernd mützelburg had traveled to washington two and a half weeks ago and told the campaign team of democratic presidential candidate john kerry that germany would not send troops to iraq . no involvement under kerry , either the newspaper , citing government sources in an advance copy of its thursday issue , said berlin aimed to make it clear that regardless of the outcome of the us election on nov .
2 , it would maintain its " red lines " on iraq . " any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " the report quoted rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , as saying . in his financial times deutschland interview , however , struck indicated germany 's support for a proposal by kerry to convene an international conference on iraq . " this is a very sensible proposal , " he told the paper .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .

but they normally are n't chalked up to faulty translation equipment . according to the reuters news agency , when schröder 's earpiece failed at joint press conference after a summit in rome on wednesday , berlusconi looked at it and declared : " it 's a german machine . " schröder , who has clashed with berlusconi on many political issues , not least iraq , looked at the brand name , philips , smiled back at his host and replied : " dutch " . the bit reveals that despite all the talk of common currency , treaties and policy , european union leaders are not above a bit of nationalistic jibing .
especially these two . the german-italian relationship has undergone a rocky period in recent years .
after berlusconi suggested a german member of the european parliament was acting like a concentration camp guard , schröder broke off his annual italian vacation . after the snafu , both leaders then went on to say relations between two of europe 's biggest countries were excellent , despite opposed positions on the war in iraq and on the future reform of the united nations .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .
" it will still not be enough for both together .

for 30 years , berz 's job has been to study meteorological and environmental climate changes for the world 's largest reinsurer .
his research helps munich re decide how to react in the marketplace .
while hurricanes , tropical storms and heat waves are known to the masses by charming names like " isabel " , " queenie " or " michaela " , in the insurance industry they are simply referred to as " basic damage events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forest fires caused millions in damages in portugal in july such weather-related natural catastrophes have caused $ 333 billion -lrb- € 271 billion -rrb- in damage in the past 10 years - six times more than 50 years ago .
and costs for insured damages have risen tenfold in the same time .
one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .
mankind to blame ?
but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic on highway in atlanta , georgia if industrial nations cut their greenhouse emissions , then developing nations will be able to expand theirs without causing an overall further imbalance .
" the industrial nations have done most of the development to this point , and have also gained the most from it , " he said .
" so in my opinion , we should have the responsibility of doing everything in our power not to increase development , but to stabilize it .

in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .
" if you walk along the shopping boulevards you see the same thing everywhere .
people want to go somewhere to be entertained , to be treated to something special . " brands to the limit inside , levi ’ s and adidas have set up little shrines to their brand .
if they want to , shoppers can buy a pair of € 500 -lrb- $ 613 -rrb- levi ’ s jeans dipped in gold leaf finish , only 100 pairs of which are available .
adidas offers limited edition shoes in a soccer-themed corner complete with a flat screen showing replays of world cups gone by . the motto of the brands is " limited and exclusive " - items bought in the pop-up store are not sold in normal stores .
german designers featured on mtv ’ s fashion showcase " designorama " offer original pieces sold only in the store .
and one of the most popular products this time around has been a sony ericsson phone that won ’ t be available in germany for another three months . “ that ’ s why i ’ m here , ” said patrick peiki , 36 , a stylishly-dressed local who organizes club events in cologne .
“ i like getting the tech stuff ahead of everyone else . ” a place for trend-setters to browse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pop-up store in germany shoppers milling around the store seemed to perfectly fit the profile of the type of people the brands are after .
schmieder spoke of reaching hip kids and “ opinion leaders ” - adspeak for people that spend money in order to set themselves apart from the masses .
though many browsed and tried on , they didn ’ t ultimately buy . “ i think the store is good in some ways , ” said frank schumann , 32 , an electrician .
“ and there are things here i ’ d like to buy .
but it ’ s also a bit expensive . ” those types of comments don ’ t bother the people behind the concept .
in the end , the pop-up store , which will end its tour in munich at the end of october , is about building image , not making money . “ it ’ s more important that it ’ s a communication platform for the brand , ” freytag said .

" there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .

" to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement -lrb- about the future -rrb- . " the remarks had sparked an outcry among some members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the junior partner in the ruling coalition , the greens party . powell confused the remarks also prompted us secretary of state colin powell to pick up the phone and call german foreign minister joschka fischer to ask if there had been a change of position , said a us state department spokesman in washington . but struck , attending a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania wednesday , insisted there was no difference between his position and that of his chancellor . " that is mad , the chancellor and i are of one view and that is the way it stays , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defense secretary geoff hoon but in a further twist british defense secretary geoff hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed struck 's comments , which he said the german minister had repeated in the romanian ski resort of poiana brasov . " it was a very welcome observation , something that i would expect germany as a good conscientious ally to undertake , " hoon said .
" i do n't see that that should come as any great surprise to anyone . focus on training truck drivers " he set out a number of conditions but made clear that germany would want to play its part if appropriate in helping .
that is obviously something that we welcome , " hoon told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a us army base in iraq in july germany does plan to train hundreds of iraqi drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months . separately , the handelsblatt business daily reported that schröder 's foreign policy advisor bernd mützelburg had traveled to washington two and a half weeks ago and told the campaign team of democratic presidential candidate john kerry that germany would not send troops to iraq . no involvement under kerry , either the newspaper , citing government sources in an advance copy of its thursday issue , said berlin aimed to make it clear that regardless of the outcome of the us election on nov .
2 , it would maintain its " red lines " on iraq . " any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " the report quoted rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , as saying . in his financial times deutschland interview , however , struck indicated germany 's support for a proposal by kerry to convene an international conference on iraq . " this is a very sensible proposal , " he told the paper .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference .

the company has a total european workforce of about 60,000 . the drastic measures were necessary to address the negative outlook for the european auto market , where demand for new cars was expected to remain sluggish , competition from other car makers - both european and asian - would likely increase and car prices fall in the coming years , gm europe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at opel 's rüsselsheim factory germany will be hit especially hard by the cuts : german car maker opel is to axe 10,000 jobs from a total workforce of 33,000 in germany by 2008 , rainer einenkel , the deputy worker 's council leader at opel 's plant in the western german town of bochum told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .

but they normally are n't chalked up to faulty translation equipment . according to the reuters news agency , when schröder 's earpiece failed at joint press conference after a summit in rome on wednesday , berlusconi looked at it and declared : " it 's a german machine . " schröder , who has clashed with berlusconi on many political issues , not least iraq , looked at the brand name , philips , smiled back at his host and replied : " dutch " . the bit reveals that despite all the talk of common currency , treaties and policy , european union leaders are not above a bit of nationalistic jibing .
especially these two . the german-italian relationship has undergone a rocky period in recent years .
after berlusconi suggested a german member of the european parliament was acting like a concentration camp guard , schröder broke off his annual italian vacation . after the snafu , both leaders then went on to say relations between two of europe 's biggest countries were excellent , despite opposed positions on the war in iraq and on the future reform of the united nations .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .

" to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement -lrb- about the future -rrb- . " the remarks had sparked an outcry among some members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the junior partner in the ruling coalition , the greens party . powell confused the remarks also prompted us secretary of state colin powell to pick up the phone and call german foreign minister joschka fischer to ask if there had been a change of position , said a us state department spokesman in washington . but struck , attending a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania wednesday , insisted there was no difference between his position and that of his chancellor . " that is mad , the chancellor and i are of one view and that is the way it stays , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defense secretary geoff hoon but in a further twist british defense secretary geoff hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed struck 's comments , which he said the german minister had repeated in the romanian ski resort of poiana brasov . " it was a very welcome observation , something that i would expect germany as a good conscientious ally to undertake , " hoon said .
" i do n't see that that should come as any great surprise to anyone . focus on training truck drivers " he set out a number of conditions but made clear that germany would want to play its part if appropriate in helping .
that is obviously something that we welcome , " hoon told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a us army base in iraq in july germany does plan to train hundreds of iraqi drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months . separately , the handelsblatt business daily reported that schröder 's foreign policy advisor bernd mützelburg had traveled to washington two and a half weeks ago and told the campaign team of democratic presidential candidate john kerry that germany would not send troops to iraq . no involvement under kerry , either the newspaper , citing government sources in an advance copy of its thursday issue , said berlin aimed to make it clear that regardless of the outcome of the us election on nov .
2 , it would maintain its " red lines " on iraq . " any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " the report quoted rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , as saying . in his financial times deutschland interview , however , struck indicated germany 's support for a proposal by kerry to convene an international conference on iraq . " this is a very sensible proposal , " he told the paper .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .

the company has a total european workforce of about 60,000 . the drastic measures were necessary to address the negative outlook for the european auto market , where demand for new cars was expected to remain sluggish , competition from other car makers - both european and asian - would likely increase and car prices fall in the coming years , gm europe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at opel 's rüsselsheim factory germany will be hit especially hard by the cuts : german car maker opel is to axe 10,000 jobs from a total workforce of 33,000 in germany by 2008 , rainer einenkel , the deputy worker 's council leader at opel 's plant in the western german town of bochum told reporters .
bochum and another plant in rüsselsheim will each lose about 4,000 jobs , he added . according to einenkel , 3,000 jobs will be cut in bochum in 2005 despite earlier reports that a job guarantee existed until 2006 . another 1,000 jobs will be cut by 2007 . no immediate plans to shut plants while gm europe chief fritz henderson said that there were no immediate plans to shut down any plants , as unions and politicians had initially feared , factory closures could not be ruled out altogether . opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , and the site in bochum in the heavy-industrialized ruhr region have been seen as the most likely targets for possible closure . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , where rüsselsheim is located said he was " deeply concerned " about the job cutting plans and urged gm to issue a guarantee that the rüsselsheim factory would not be shut down .

for 30 years , berz 's job has been to study meteorological and environmental climate changes for the world 's largest reinsurer .
his research helps munich re decide how to react in the marketplace .
while hurricanes , tropical storms and heat waves are known to the masses by charming names like " isabel " , " queenie " or " michaela " , in the insurance industry they are simply referred to as " basic damage events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forest fires caused millions in damages in portugal in july such weather-related natural catastrophes have caused $ 333 billion -lrb- € 271 billion -rrb- in damage in the past 10 years - six times more than 50 years ago .
and costs for insured damages have risen tenfold in the same time .
one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .
mankind to blame ?
but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic on highway in atlanta , georgia if industrial nations cut their greenhouse emissions , then developing nations will be able to expand theirs without causing an overall further imbalance .
" the industrial nations have done most of the development to this point , and have also gained the most from it , " he said .
" so in my opinion , we should have the responsibility of doing everything in our power not to increase development , but to stabilize it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 14.10.2004 distorting the us ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders is a long-time resident of los angeles in his lates movie , " land of plenty , " german director wim wenders takes a critical look at the us after the sept .
11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .

however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 " guerilla stores " hit germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " limited and exclusive " is the mantra of the pop-up stores in order to combat consumer malaise in germany , brands and clothing stores are unleashing “ guerilla stores ” offering limited clothes for a limited time aimed at building their own image and sales . a week ago , the large space at the corner of cologne ’ s rudolfplatz was just another empty storefront and another silent reminder of germany ’ s economic malaise . but passers-by early this week had to do a double take .
in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .
" if you walk along the shopping boulevards you see the same thing everywhere .
people want to go somewhere to be entertained , to be treated to something special . " brands to the limit inside , levi ’ s and adidas have set up little shrines to their brand .
if they want to , shoppers can buy a pair of € 500 -lrb- $ 613 -rrb- levi ’ s jeans dipped in gold leaf finish , only 100 pairs of which are available .
adidas offers limited edition shoes in a soccer-themed corner complete with a flat screen showing replays of world cups gone by . the motto of the brands is " limited and exclusive " - items bought in the pop-up store are not sold in normal stores .
german designers featured on mtv ’ s fashion showcase " designorama " offer original pieces sold only in the store .
and one of the most popular products this time around has been a sony ericsson phone that won ’ t be available in germany for another three months . “ that ’ s why i ’ m here , ” said patrick peiki , 36 , a stylishly-dressed local who organizes club events in cologne .
“ i like getting the tech stuff ahead of everyone else . ” a place for trend-setters to browse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pop-up store in germany shoppers milling around the store seemed to perfectly fit the profile of the type of people the brands are after .
schmieder spoke of reaching hip kids and “ opinion leaders ” - adspeak for people that spend money in order to set themselves apart from the masses .
though many browsed and tried on , they didn ’ t ultimately buy . “ i think the store is good in some ways , ” said frank schumann , 32 , an electrician .
“ and there are things here i ’ d like to buy .
but it ’ s also a bit expensive . ” those types of comments don ’ t bother the people behind the concept .
in the end , the pop-up store , which will end its tour in munich at the end of october , is about building image , not making money . “ it ’ s more important that it ’ s a communication platform for the brand , ” freytag said .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 " guerilla stores " hit germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " limited and exclusive " is the mantra of the pop-up stores in order to combat consumer malaise in germany , brands and clothing stores are unleashing “ guerilla stores ” offering limited clothes for a limited time aimed at building their own image and sales . a week ago , the large space at the corner of cologne ’ s rudolfplatz was just another empty storefront and another silent reminder of germany ’ s economic malaise . but passers-by early this week had to do a double take .
in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .
" if you walk along the shopping boulevards you see the same thing everywhere .
people want to go somewhere to be entertained , to be treated to something special . " brands to the limit inside , levi ’ s and adidas have set up little shrines to their brand .
if they want to , shoppers can buy a pair of € 500 -lrb- $ 613 -rrb- levi ’ s jeans dipped in gold leaf finish , only 100 pairs of which are available .
adidas offers limited edition shoes in a soccer-themed corner complete with a flat screen showing replays of world cups gone by . the motto of the brands is " limited and exclusive " - items bought in the pop-up store are not sold in normal stores .
german designers featured on mtv ’ s fashion showcase " designorama " offer original pieces sold only in the store .
and one of the most popular products this time around has been a sony ericsson phone that won ’ t be available in germany for another three months . “ that ’ s why i ’ m here , ” said patrick peiki , 36 , a stylishly-dressed local who organizes club events in cologne .
“ i like getting the tech stuff ahead of everyone else . ” a place for trend-setters to browse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pop-up store in germany shoppers milling around the store seemed to perfectly fit the profile of the type of people the brands are after .
schmieder spoke of reaching hip kids and “ opinion leaders ” - adspeak for people that spend money in order to set themselves apart from the masses .
though many browsed and tried on , they didn ’ t ultimately buy . “ i think the store is good in some ways , ” said frank schumann , 32 , an electrician .
“ and there are things here i ’ d like to buy .
but it ’ s also a bit expensive . ” those types of comments don ’ t bother the people behind the concept .
in the end , the pop-up store , which will end its tour in munich at the end of october , is about building image , not making money . “ it ’ s more important that it ’ s a communication platform for the brand , ” freytag said .

in the former italian fashion store , mtv , adidas , sony ericcson and levi ’ s had set up a gleaming white display space featuring limited edition phones , jeans and other hip gear . the pop-up store , the third version in as many weeks and cities , is a joint venture by the four companies designed to reach so-called trend setters in germany as well as piquing the interest of average shoppers reluctant to loosen their purse-strings at the moment . the one-week shop is the latest incarnation of the “ guerilla store ” strategy increasingly employed by retailers as a way to create a buzz around their products and image . “ it ’ s a clever business idea and it maybe offers the consumer another reason to buy , ” olaf roek of the german retailer ’ s association told dw-world .
“ nowadays , where retail is stagnating , you definitely need to think about what kind of new methods of promotion you can offer consumers . ” cool , not commercial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mtv pop-up store in germany in the months before they opened their first pop-up store in berlin at the beginning of october , heberlein & mauerer , the creative agency behind the event , scouted potential locations .
the conditions : the store had to be away from the commercial strips in a neighborhood considered cool and underground .
the landlord also had to be willing to rent out the space for no longer than a week . “ that ’ s one of the hardest things , ” uwe freytag , one of heberlein & mauerer ’ s managing directors , told dw-world . two weeks before a store is to open , freytag and his team bombard the city with stickers and flyers to generate buzz .
five days before the store opens , the address and opening hours are listed on the pop-up store web site .
on the opening days in berlin and hamburg , the two cities that preceded cologne , dozens walked into the nondescript storefronts . " the consumer in germany is extremely bored , " said martin schmieder , spokesman for the creative agency behind the mtv pop-up store .
" if you walk along the shopping boulevards you see the same thing everywhere .
people want to go somewhere to be entertained , to be treated to something special . " brands to the limit inside , levi ’ s and adidas have set up little shrines to their brand .
if they want to , shoppers can buy a pair of € 500 -lrb- $ 613 -rrb- levi ’ s jeans dipped in gold leaf finish , only 100 pairs of which are available .
adidas offers limited edition shoes in a soccer-themed corner complete with a flat screen showing replays of world cups gone by . the motto of the brands is " limited and exclusive " - items bought in the pop-up store are not sold in normal stores .
german designers featured on mtv ’ s fashion showcase " designorama " offer original pieces sold only in the store .
and one of the most popular products this time around has been a sony ericsson phone that won ’ t be available in germany for another three months . “ that ’ s why i ’ m here , ” said patrick peiki , 36 , a stylishly-dressed local who organizes club events in cologne .
“ i like getting the tech stuff ahead of everyone else . ” a place for trend-setters to browse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pop-up store in germany shoppers milling around the store seemed to perfectly fit the profile of the type of people the brands are after .
schmieder spoke of reaching hip kids and “ opinion leaders ” - adspeak for people that spend money in order to set themselves apart from the masses .
though many browsed and tried on , they didn ’ t ultimately buy . “ i think the store is good in some ways , ” said frank schumann , 32 , an electrician .
“ and there are things here i ’ d like to buy .
but it ’ s also a bit expensive . ” those types of comments don ’ t bother the people behind the concept .
in the end , the pop-up store , which will end its tour in munich at the end of october , is about building image , not making money . “ it ’ s more important that it ’ s a communication platform for the brand , ” freytag said .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

" to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .

" i do n't see that that should come as any great surprise to anyone . focus on training truck drivers " he set out a number of conditions but made clear that germany would want to play its part if appropriate in helping .

the company has a total european workforce of about 60,000 . the drastic measures were necessary to address the negative outlook for the european auto market , where demand for new cars was expected to remain sluggish , competition from other car makers - both european and asian - would likely increase and car prices fall in the coming years , gm europe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at opel 's rüsselsheim factory germany will be hit especially hard by the cuts : german car maker opel is to axe 10,000 jobs from a total workforce of 33,000 in germany by 2008 , rainer einenkel , the deputy worker 's council leader at opel 's plant in the western german town of bochum told reporters .
bochum and another plant in rüsselsheim will each lose about 4,000 jobs , he added . according to einenkel , 3,000 jobs will be cut in bochum in 2005 despite earlier reports that a job guarantee existed until 2006 . another 1,000 jobs will be cut by 2007 . no immediate plans to shut plants while gm europe chief fritz henderson said that there were no immediate plans to shut down any plants , as unions and politicians had initially feared , factory closures could not be ruled out altogether . opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , and the site in bochum in the heavy-industrialized ruhr region have been seen as the most likely targets for possible closure . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , where rüsselsheim is located said he was " deeply concerned " about the job cutting plans and urged gm to issue a guarantee that the rüsselsheim factory would not be shut down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roland koch " it 's now about preventing the worst and limiting the damage , " koch -lrb- photo -rrb- said . in addition to opel , gm europe comprises vauxhall in britain and saab in sweden . the woes at opel were the reason why german economy minister wolfgang clement cancelled a planned meeting thursday with his french counterpart nicolas sarkozy at the last minute . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de up to 7,000 jobs threatened at opel german car maker opel , the loss-making subsidiary of general motors , is to axe 6,000-7,000 jobs from a total german workforce of around 12,000 , according to news reports .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .

chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

" to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement -lrb- about the future -rrb- . " the remarks had sparked an outcry among some members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the junior partner in the ruling coalition , the greens party . powell confused the remarks also prompted us secretary of state colin powell to pick up the phone and call german foreign minister joschka fischer to ask if there had been a change of position , said a us state department spokesman in washington . but struck , attending a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania wednesday , insisted there was no difference between his position and that of his chancellor . " that is mad , the chancellor and i are of one view and that is the way it stays , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defense secretary geoff hoon but in a further twist british defense secretary geoff hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed struck 's comments , which he said the german minister had repeated in the romanian ski resort of poiana brasov . " it was a very welcome observation , something that i would expect germany as a good conscientious ally to undertake , " hoon said .
" i do n't see that that should come as any great surprise to anyone . focus on training truck drivers " he set out a number of conditions but made clear that germany would want to play its part if appropriate in helping .
that is obviously something that we welcome , " hoon told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a us army base in iraq in july germany does plan to train hundreds of iraqi drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months . separately , the handelsblatt business daily reported that schröder 's foreign policy advisor bernd mützelburg had traveled to washington two and a half weeks ago and told the campaign team of democratic presidential candidate john kerry that germany would not send troops to iraq . no involvement under kerry , either the newspaper , citing government sources in an advance copy of its thursday issue , said berlin aimed to make it clear that regardless of the outcome of the us election on nov .
2 , it would maintain its " red lines " on iraq . " any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " the report quoted rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , as saying . in his financial times deutschland interview , however , struck indicated germany 's support for a proposal by kerry to convene an international conference on iraq . " this is a very sensible proposal , " he told the paper .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .

" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "

pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 14.10.2004 distorting the us ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders is a long-time resident of los angeles in his lates movie , " land of plenty , " german director wim wenders takes a critical look at the us after the sept .
11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

" to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement -lrb- about the future -rrb- . " the remarks had sparked an outcry among some members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the junior partner in the ruling coalition , the greens party . powell confused the remarks also prompted us secretary of state colin powell to pick up the phone and call german foreign minister joschka fischer to ask if there had been a change of position , said a us state department spokesman in washington . but struck , attending a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania wednesday , insisted there was no difference between his position and that of his chancellor . " that is mad , the chancellor and i are of one view and that is the way it stays , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defense secretary geoff hoon but in a further twist british defense secretary geoff hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed struck 's comments , which he said the german minister had repeated in the romanian ski resort of poiana brasov . " it was a very welcome observation , something that i would expect germany as a good conscientious ally to undertake , " hoon said .
" i do n't see that that should come as any great surprise to anyone . focus on training truck drivers " he set out a number of conditions but made clear that germany would want to play its part if appropriate in helping .
that is obviously something that we welcome , " hoon told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a us army base in iraq in july germany does plan to train hundreds of iraqi drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months . separately , the handelsblatt business daily reported that schröder 's foreign policy advisor bernd mützelburg had traveled to washington two and a half weeks ago and told the campaign team of democratic presidential candidate john kerry that germany would not send troops to iraq . no involvement under kerry , either the newspaper , citing government sources in an advance copy of its thursday issue , said berlin aimed to make it clear that regardless of the outcome of the us election on nov .
2 , it would maintain its " red lines " on iraq . " any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " the report quoted rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , as saying . in his financial times deutschland interview , however , struck indicated germany 's support for a proposal by kerry to convene an international conference on iraq . " this is a very sensible proposal , " he told the paper .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .

" to be clear , we will send no troops to iraq , " schröder said at a press conference with italian prime minister silvio berlusconi in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq . " there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .
" in general , however , there is no one who can predict developments in iraq in such a way that he could make such a binding statement -lrb- about the future -rrb- . " the remarks had sparked an outcry among some members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the junior partner in the ruling coalition , the greens party . powell confused the remarks also prompted us secretary of state colin powell to pick up the phone and call german foreign minister joschka fischer to ask if there had been a change of position , said a us state department spokesman in washington . but struck , attending a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania wednesday , insisted there was no difference between his position and that of his chancellor . " that is mad , the chancellor and i are of one view and that is the way it stays , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defense secretary geoff hoon but in a further twist british defense secretary geoff hoon -lrb- photo -rrb- welcomed struck 's comments , which he said the german minister had repeated in the romanian ski resort of poiana brasov . " it was a very welcome observation , something that i would expect germany as a good conscientious ally to undertake , " hoon said .
" i do n't see that that should come as any great surprise to anyone . focus on training truck drivers " he set out a number of conditions but made clear that germany would want to play its part if appropriate in helping .
that is obviously something that we welcome , " hoon told reporters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqi national guard recruits fire ak-47 rifles during basic training exercises held on a us army base in iraq in july germany does plan to train hundreds of iraqi drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months . separately , the handelsblatt business daily reported that schröder 's foreign policy advisor bernd mützelburg had traveled to washington two and a half weeks ago and told the campaign team of democratic presidential candidate john kerry that germany would not send troops to iraq . no involvement under kerry , either the newspaper , citing government sources in an advance copy of its thursday issue , said berlin aimed to make it clear that regardless of the outcome of the us election on nov .
2 , it would maintain its " red lines " on iraq . " any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " the report quoted rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , as saying . in his financial times deutschland interview , however , struck indicated germany 's support for a proposal by kerry to convene an international conference on iraq . " this is a very sensible proposal , " he told the paper .
" the situation in iraq can only be cleared up when all those involved sit together at one table .
germany has taken on responsibilities in iraq , including financial ones ; this would naturally justify our involvement in such a conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.10.2004 french lawmakers debate turkish eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac backs a referendum the french parliament is set for a heated debate on the controversial issue of turkey 's eu accession , an issue that divides french politicians and public alike . french president jacques chirac has been treading carefully on the sensitive issue of turkish accession to the european union . in december , european heads of state will meet in brussels to decide whether accession talks should begin ; the current german government is widely expected to vote for talks to start . but opinions are anything but united on the issue ; in france as well as germany , there has been talks of petition drives opposing the negotiations , and france even considered changing its constitution to allow a popular referendum on the issue . in recent days chirac has noted that turkey has been given the prospect of possible eu accession for years – and that prior commitments must be adhered to .
but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .
merkel calls for petition against turkish membership germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel has called for a petition to be drawn up against turkey 's membership of the european union and has advocated privileged partnership status as an alternative .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .

he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .

however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .

some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .

i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "

" there will be no change " in our policy at this point , said the chancellor . the questions concerning a possible change in germany 's position followed the publication of an interview in wednesday 's financial times deutschland in which defense minister peter struck indicated that berlin , which fiercely opposed the us-led invasion , might deploy troops to iraq if conditions there change . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder meeting german soliders stationed in afghanistan last week " at present i rule out the deployment of german troops in iraq , " struck said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .

so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .

that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.10.2004 french lawmakers debate turkish eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac backs a referendum the french parliament is set for a heated debate on the controversial issue of turkey 's eu accession , an issue that divides french politicians and public alike . french president jacques chirac has been treading carefully on the sensitive issue of turkish accession to the european union . in december , european heads of state will meet in brussels to decide whether accession talks should begin ; the current german government is widely expected to vote for talks to start . but opinions are anything but united on the issue ; in france as well as germany , there has been talks of petition drives opposing the negotiations , and france even considered changing its constitution to allow a popular referendum on the issue . in recent days chirac has noted that turkey has been given the prospect of possible eu accession for years – and that prior commitments must be adhered to .
but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .
merkel calls for petition against turkish membership germany 's conservative opposition leader angela merkel has called for a petition to be drawn up against turkey 's membership of the european union and has advocated privileged partnership status as an alternative .

the company has a total european workforce of about 60,000 . the drastic measures were necessary to address the negative outlook for the european auto market , where demand for new cars was expected to remain sluggish , competition from other car makers - both european and asian - would likely increase and car prices fall in the coming years , gm europe said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at opel 's rüsselsheim factory germany will be hit especially hard by the cuts : german car maker opel is to axe 10,000 jobs from a total workforce of 33,000 in germany by 2008 , rainer einenkel , the deputy worker 's council leader at opel 's plant in the western german town of bochum told reporters .
bochum and another plant in rüsselsheim will each lose about 4,000 jobs , he added . according to einenkel , 3,000 jobs will be cut in bochum in 2005 despite earlier reports that a job guarantee existed until 2006 . another 1,000 jobs will be cut by 2007 . no immediate plans to shut plants while gm europe chief fritz henderson said that there were no immediate plans to shut down any plants , as unions and politicians had initially feared , factory closures could not be ruled out altogether . opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , and the site in bochum in the heavy-industrialized ruhr region have been seen as the most likely targets for possible closure . roland koch , the christian democratic premier of the state of hesse , where rüsselsheim is located said he was " deeply concerned " about the job cutting plans and urged gm to issue a guarantee that the rüsselsheim factory would not be shut down .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.10.2004 french lawmakers debate turkish eu bid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac backs a referendum the french parliament is set for a heated debate on the controversial issue of turkey 's eu accession , an issue that divides french politicians and public alike . french president jacques chirac has been treading carefully on the sensitive issue of turkish accession to the european union . in december , european heads of state will meet in brussels to decide whether accession talks should begin ; the current german government is widely expected to vote for talks to start . but opinions are anything but united on the issue ; in france as well as germany , there has been talks of petition drives opposing the negotiations , and france even considered changing its constitution to allow a popular referendum on the issue . in recent days chirac has noted that turkey has been given the prospect of possible eu accession for years – and that prior commitments must be adhered to .
but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .

for 30 years , berz 's job has been to study meteorological and environmental climate changes for the world 's largest reinsurer .
his research helps munich re decide how to react in the marketplace .
while hurricanes , tropical storms and heat waves are known to the masses by charming names like " isabel " , " queenie " or " michaela " , in the insurance industry they are simply referred to as " basic damage events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forest fires caused millions in damages in portugal in july such weather-related natural catastrophes have caused $ 333 billion -lrb- € 271 billion -rrb- in damage in the past 10 years - six times more than 50 years ago .
and costs for insured damages have risen tenfold in the same time .
one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .
mankind to blame ?
but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traffic on highway in atlanta , georgia if industrial nations cut their greenhouse emissions , then developing nations will be able to expand theirs without causing an overall further imbalance .
" the industrial nations have done most of the development to this point , and have also gained the most from it , " he said .
" so in my opinion , we should have the responsibility of doing everything in our power not to increase development , but to stabilize it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

kahn was blasted for a recent fracas with international team-mate miroslav klose , when he pushed his gloves into the face of the werder bremen striker , and vfb stuttgart 's hildebrand claims kahn needs to grow up .
" you do not put your gloves in the face of a fellow player especially when you play together for the national side , " hildebrand told die zeit newspaper .
" at his age and after all he has achieved in football that aggressive nature should not be needed . "
hildebrand , ten years kahn 's junior at 25 , insisted that he , unlike kahn , can keep his emotions under control .
" i am not the type of person to treat team-mates like that and and i do not want to be someone who goes for the throat . "
hildebrand , currently third choice goalkeeper for germany , has watched arsenal shot-stopper jens lehman and kahn vye for the number one jersey both on and off the pitch .
" in the case of kahn and lehmann two personalities are clashing and in the long run timo will be the winner , " stuttgart manager matthias sammer said .
a poll by kicker magazine on thursday claimed hildebrand was the best choice , ahead of lehmann and kahn .

one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .

" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .

in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .

for 30 years , berz 's job has been to study meteorological and environmental climate changes for the world 's largest reinsurer .
his research helps munich re decide how to react in the marketplace .
while hurricanes , tropical storms and heat waves are known to the masses by charming names like " isabel " , " queenie " or " michaela " , in the insurance industry they are simply referred to as " basic damage events . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forest fires caused millions in damages in portugal in july such weather-related natural catastrophes have caused $ 333 billion -lrb- € 271 billion -rrb- in damage in the past 10 years - six times more than 50 years ago .
and costs for insured damages have risen tenfold in the same time .
one reason for the increase in natural catastrophes is global warming , which has led to a rise in weather-related catastrophes , according to scientists .
global warming is thought to be caused by increased greenhouse emissions .
according to a un report on global warming , by the end of this century the mean global temperature will have risen by somewhere between 1.5 and 6 degrees centigrade .
" that means , we 'll have temperatures on the earth that mankind has never experienced , combined with a strong increase in extreme temperatures , " berz told deutsche welle .
mankind to blame ?
but climate change is n't the only thing responsible for the increase in damages - mankind has had a hand in the affair as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico city is just one of a growing number of cities with tens of millions of people around the world .
a disaster today tends to hit more people because of overall greater population .
the world population has more than doubled in the past fifty years and most people now live in cities - which are not only more densely populated , but also more spread out , berz said .
so when a " basic damage event " strikes , " the probability of it hitting a big town is getting greater and greater , " he said .
" in addition , many cities are particularly exposed - think of the coastal areas .
and this trend goes worldwide . "
and because our society has become so reliant on infrastructure we are particularly vulnerable , berz added .
" we are on a 24-hour drip of functioning infrastructure , " berz said .
" a disturbance like a natural catastrophe , means necessities like gas , electricity or oil are disturbed , as well as traffic and communication .
all these things are necessary for the economy to function , and individuals as well . "
big business about one fifth of all weather-related damages are paid for by insurance .
some 6,000 primary insurers are then re-insured by munich re .
as a business , then , munich re says it has to take the current trend of global warming into account .
one way to do this is to passing some of the risk on to the customer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the morteratsch glacier in switzerland has been melting at a fast pace " premiums will have to be increased relatively , " berz said .
" and we have to let our customers know that we , as reinsurer , also have to take more big catastrophes into account , and thus need greater cash reserves .
that is our main problem . "
not only do the reinsurers take measures to gird their wallets , they also work on the prevention angle .
in order to keep damages low , munich re is involved in initiatives in areas from infrastructure to city planning .
the company would for instance try to influence decisions on things like building codes in earthquake areas , or land-use regulations in flood zones .
local initiatives important risk-analyst berz said local initiatives are key in these areas , which can be influenced by individual cities and countries .
but local action is less relevant when it comes to a world-wide issue like the weather .
a global phenomenon requires global climate protection , berz said .

in the end , the pop-up store , which will end its tour in munich at the end of october , is about building image , not making money . “ it ’ s more important that it ’ s a communication platform for the brand , ” freytag said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.10.2004 experts doubt success of far-right alliance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two far-right parties , one poster come elections in 2006 ?
a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .

a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts . germany 's most prominent far-right parties , the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- and the national party -lrb- npd -rrb- , have announced plans to combine forces for an assault on the bundestag in the general election in 2006 . germany 's neighbors are fearful of the rise of right-wing extremism in light of the country 's nazi past .
but political experts give the unholy alliance little chance of gaining enough votes to enter the german parliament : a party has to get at least 5 percent of votes in order to get seats in the bundestag . the whole of europe looked on in dismay as the far-right parties enjoyed relative successes in germany 's recent state elections .
the npd garnered enough support to enter the state parliament in saxony while the dvu did the same in brandenburg . the spanish newspaper el pais called the results a " dangerous radicalization " of german politics while il messagero in italy deplored the rise of the ultra-right and lamented its popularity within a segment of the german population . germany 's neighbors were not alone in airing concern .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein warned on tuesday of the rise of a " right popular front . "
the polling institute forsa further increased the fear by predicting that the combined right-wing party could get between 10 and 15 percent of the vote in a general election - more than enough to sit in the bundestag . all talk , no action ? oskar niedermayer , a professor of political sciences at berlin 's free university , has been watching developments concerning the far-right with interest . " there have been attempts at collaborations for many years , " niedermayer told dw-world .
" before the last european elections , the npd attempted it again .
but the republicans and the dvu did not react . " even now , he said , there has only been a declaration of intent : " still nothing is final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd leader udo voigt and dvu leader gerhard frey should the npd and dvu cooperate , however , this would really " be something qualitatively new , " niedermayer said .
nevertheless , he does not believe the right wing alliance would succeed in getting into the bundestag . lack of cohesion oscar gabriel , a political scientist from the university of stuttgart , said he believes the conditions are not right for any right wing alliance to succeed . " there is no party program , " gabriel said .
" there are no persuasive , guiding personalities .
and there is no exhaustive organization . " niedermayer added that both right-wing parties would have too little money to fund a full-scale nationwide campaign . " besides , they have little media support in contrast -lrb- to similar parties in -rrb- other european countries , " he said . ideological differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ideological differences also remain between the two prospective partners and could make such an alliance difficult : the dvu would find it hard to assimilate the more radical aspects of the npd and an approach to the republicans would also prove problematic " because they try to distance themselves from the far-right , " niedermayer said . despite the barriers to an alliance , oscar gabriel said he still believes right-wing extremism is a problem , above all in the east of germany .
but he added that he is doubtful " that the campaign there is openly against democracy . " caught up in the glow of success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger apfel celebrates with his fellow party members as the npd triumphs in saxony .
anetta kahane , the chairperson of the amadeu antonio association , a group that promotes projects against right , said she believes that any alliance will be a ramshackle one . " this has come into being in the immediate elation of the election success , " kahane said .
" but there is so much potential conflict in it .
and it is also doubtful whether the collaboration would be recognized by the courts .
should they create it , however , this would be menacing . " none of the experts ruled out the right-wing parties entering the bundestag in the future but a success in the 2006 election for a combined alliance remains unlikely .
gabriel said he believes that any gains will be minimal . " if one adds 0.5 and the other 0.7 percent , that 's still only 1.2 percent , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .

now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .

now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .

he is to stand trial on high treason charges for planning a terror attack on the turkish capital ankara .
turkey 's justice minister assured the press that kaplan would receive a fair trial .
the trial is seen by many as a test of whether turkey 's updated court system - once synonymous with torture tactics , human rights abuses and rigged verdicts - now befits a country seeking entry into the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.10.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc germany rejects french shipbuilding plan the german government does not believe that the concept put forward by the french government for the creation of a european shipbuilding giant is workable , the business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday .
berlin objected to the idea of merging french naval shipbuilders dcn and french defense electronics group thales with the corresponding activities of german firms thyssenkrupp and hdw to form a european giant similar to eads in the aerospace sector , because dcn is still state-owned , the newspaper reported quoting german economy ministry sources .
any tie-up would have to be between private-sector companies in order to ensure that it was a merger of equals , the sources were quoted as saying .
the shipyards would therefore have to be privatized first and made profitable before a merger could go ahead .
similarly , berlin rejected the proposal by french economy minister nicolas sarkozy that the loss-making civilian shipbuilding activities of french group alstom should be incorporated into any eads-like tie-up .
alstom has been looking for a buyer for its loss-making shipyards for years .
it was such differences between sarkozy and his german counterpart wolfgang clement over european industrial policy that were behind the last-minute cancellation of a planned meeting of the two ministers on thursday , handelsblatt said .
the german government said clement called off the meeting at the last minute late wednesday citing the difficult situation at general motors 's german unit opel .

berlin objected to the idea of merging french naval shipbuilders dcn and french defense electronics group thales with the corresponding activities of german firms thyssenkrupp and hdw to form a european giant similar to eads in the aerospace sector , because dcn is still state-owned , the newspaper reported quoting german economy ministry sources .
any tie-up would have to be between private-sector companies in order to ensure that it was a merger of equals , the sources were quoted as saying .
the shipyards would therefore have to be privatized first and made profitable before a merger could go ahead .
similarly , berlin rejected the proposal by french economy minister nicolas sarkozy that the loss-making civilian shipbuilding activities of french group alstom should be incorporated into any eads-like tie-up .
alstom has been looking for a buyer for its loss-making shipyards for years .
it was such differences between sarkozy and his german counterpart wolfgang clement over european industrial policy that were behind the last-minute cancellation of a planned meeting of the two ministers on thursday , handelsblatt said .
the german government said clement called off the meeting at the last minute late wednesday citing the difficult situation at general motors 's german unit opel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 14.10.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc germany rejects french shipbuilding plan the german government does not believe that the concept put forward by the french government for the creation of a european shipbuilding giant is workable , the business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday .
berlin objected to the idea of merging french naval shipbuilders dcn and french defense electronics group thales with the corresponding activities of german firms thyssenkrupp and hdw to form a european giant similar to eads in the aerospace sector , because dcn is still state-owned , the newspaper reported quoting german economy ministry sources .
any tie-up would have to be between private-sector companies in order to ensure that it was a merger of equals , the sources were quoted as saying .
the shipyards would therefore have to be privatized first and made profitable before a merger could go ahead .
similarly , berlin rejected the proposal by french economy minister nicolas sarkozy that the loss-making civilian shipbuilding activities of french group alstom should be incorporated into any eads-like tie-up .
alstom has been looking for a buyer for its loss-making shipyards for years .
it was such differences between sarkozy and his german counterpart wolfgang clement over european industrial policy that were behind the last-minute cancellation of a planned meeting of the two ministers on thursday , handelsblatt said .
the german government said clement called off the meeting at the last minute late wednesday citing the difficult situation at general motors 's german unit opel .

the train will leave the la hague nuclear plant in northern france on november 6 , will cross the french-german border on november 7 and is expected to reach the german town of dannenberg 24 hours later .
the 12 containers will then be loaded on to trucks to cover the last few kilometers to the gorleben dump , said the x-tausendmalquer protest group .
anti-nuclear demonstrators will gather in dannenberg on november 6 and stage a sit-in across a road in an attempt to stop the trucks reaching gorleben .
police refused to confirm the date of the transport .
more than 12,000 police were deployed last year for similar convoys in one of the largest security operations of its kind ever mounted in germany .
anti-nuclear and environmental campaigners say the shipments are dangerous and that the waste will contaminate the water table at gorleben .
germany , which has no treatment facilities of its own , sends spent fuel rods for reprocessing at the la hague plant before they are returned here for storage .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .

chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .

but he ’ s also mentioned that france could put an end to membership negotiations any time by exercising a veto .
these remarks have triggered a heated debate across the country , reflected in thursday 's parliamentary debate in paris .
chirac tries new tactic the debate is hottest within jacques chirac ’ s own party .
chirac tried to pass of the responsibility for a decision by suggesting a change in the constitution to allow a public referendum on the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister erdogan gave a speech on eu accession but the members of the national assembly are demanding a parliamentary decision before the eu summit in december , when european leaders are to decide whether or not to begin membership negotiations .
chirac has tried to defuse the situation .
" of course parliament will be heard and consulted on this matter at all times of the decision making process , " he told reporters .
" but of course in a way that is in accordance with our constitution . "
according to the french constitution , the president determines the country ’ s foreign policy .
the only way the parliament could force its will on the government in foreign policy matters would be a vote of no confidence toppling the whole government .
toothless debate ?
the conservative dominated parliament may not want to go that far , but in order to prevent any embarrassment , chirac is attempting to avoid a vote on the matter altogether .
a debate yes , but not a vote .
dominique paillet , from chirac 's center-right ump party , is one of those who are upset at the prospect of a debate without any real consequences .
he has been collecting signatures against turkey ’ s eu membership and claims that one hundred parliamentarians in the ruling party ’ s camp have signed .
" the government does not want to hear the opinions of the representatives of the people for fear of criticism , " paillet told reporters .
" there is no question that a majority of the parliamentarians are opposed to turkish eu membership .
debating is good , but real democracy would include a vote . "
laurent fabius from the opposition socialists agreed .
pointing to the turkish parliament ’ s vote on the matter , he said : " it would be paradoxical if the french parliament would have less of a say than the turkish one . "
while the french opposition also stands divided on the matter of turkey ’ s eu membership , analysts say they are keeping a lid on discussions and are rather sitting back to rub their hands in glee as the conservative camp damages itself on the matter .
hostile public meanwhile the french public is growing increasingly hostile to the idea of turkish eu membership .
a majority say they are against it on principle , believing that turkey is not culturally or geographically a part of europe .
passions are running high in france , with the issue of turkish membership dominating the front pages almost every day .
german politics recently saw an uproar when angela merkel , head of the opposition christian democrat party , announced she would start a petition drive to collect signatures opposing turkish entry in the european union .
the move was denounced by some as low-level populism , and split opinion even within her own party . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's eu moment of truth click here for dw-world 's special dossier on turkey 's progress towards eu membership .

the train will leave the la hague nuclear plant in northern france on november 6 , will cross the french-german border on november 7 and is expected to reach the german town of dannenberg 24 hours later .
the 12 containers will then be loaded on to trucks to cover the last few kilometers to the gorleben dump , said the x-tausendmalquer protest group .
anti-nuclear demonstrators will gather in dannenberg on november 6 and stage a sit-in across a road in an attempt to stop the trucks reaching gorleben .
police refused to confirm the date of the transport .
more than 12,000 police were deployed last year for similar convoys in one of the largest security operations of its kind ever mounted in germany .
anti-nuclear and environmental campaigners say the shipments are dangerous and that the waste will contaminate the water table at gorleben .
germany , which has no treatment facilities of its own , sends spent fuel rods for reprocessing at the la hague plant before they are returned here for storage .

11 attacks .
dw-world readers shared their views on whether an outsider can accurately protray the country . wim wenders has as much business critiquing americans and american society as i 'd have presuming to critique german society and german kultur .
no one who has n't been raised in any particular country can possibly understand the nuances involved .
i am sick and tired of the way outsiders reduce americans to cartoonish figures simply to validate their pet views . - laurie kunze i believe outsiders can accurately portray life in the us , but they do have to go in with an open mind .
a fixation of life in la and a hatred for president bush is not what i would call an open mind . - boyd lawrence , usa wenders circle of friends only include like-minded thinkers -lrb- liberals -rrb- .
he has probably never has a discussing with americans about why they love their country .
he is probably puzzled why we would fight and die for our country , not like the french who run rather than defend their country .
although germany also appears not to have the stomach to fight terrorism .
i wish he would have gone home to his little apartment , high gas prices , high unemployment and unhappy people .
maybe he should just stick to doing pictures about germans and leave us poor american alone . - marc johnson sr. , usa of course outside film makers can portray life in any free country - i 'm not sure what " accurately " means though .
what we can say about him is he only " portrays " where he takes no risks for his health , safety or pocketbook .
more power to him - it 's up to others to decide how " accurate " he is . - harriette rodari , switzerland normally , i do not reply to such leftist-socialist people .
however , i wish to state my perspective since i live in part of the usa far away from the leftist-extremism of hollywood .
first , americans are not fearful .
most are living their lives as before , trusting in our government to tackle the problem of terrorism within the us .
second , most commentaries i have read from people outside the us have a very slanted leftist-socialist tone , a tone which the majority here reject .
third , again most outside commentaries view christianity in the us as extreme fundamentalist .
this is far from the truth .
most believe what is in the bible is true and generally live their lives based on a belief in jesus christ as the messiah .
we are not an agressive people , that is not expansionist , rather the majority is actually isolationist .
many people can not tell you what is happening in the world , let alone what is happening in other us states .
we tend to focus on our lives and those around us .
we want to be friendly with everyone , but distrust anyone who wishes us wrong . - keith a peregrine on the question , can outsiders like wenders accurately portray life in america , to paraphrase bill clinton the answer is , it depends on how you define " accurately . "
america is such a huge and diverse and often contradictory country that it is actually impossible for anyone , whether us national or foreigner , to provide the one single valid " accurate " picture .
some groups - like the religious right in the us - of course claim to speak for a certain kind of america and would gladly quash all dissenting views and perspectives , which do not fit into their " accurate " description .
this is why , as a us national living in germany , i welcome wenders ' attempt - and that by any foreigner , for that matter - to provide a different perspective .
not because it might give americans any true answers , but instead because it might help us to ask some truthful questions . - douglas sutton i certainly have not seen this film .
however , the description looks like just another propaganda attack at america .
let 's not forget what america stands for .
this country was founded upon cultural diversity , and continues to attract more immigrants than the sum of all other countries combined .
do these millions of immigrants not see the paranoid xenophobia that this " artist " is so willing to portray ?
i have witnessed first hand the homelessness at many of the bahnhofs of germany 's large cities as well .
i notice how , after much consternation , mr. wenders decided not to leave america .
maybe , just maybe he should tell us why he left germany in the first place .
perhaps it had something to do with run-away unemployment , taxes , or a welfare state gone overboard . - c. kuch , usa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attacking the " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.10.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc german-russian gang leader on trial a 21-year-old russian-german man who led a gang of drug dealers on a killing spree which left five people dead in the space of six weeks went on trial with his accomplices in bochum on thursday .
eugen n. and five eastern european men aged 21 to 27 are accused of killing the men following disagreements over drug deals .
the prosecution alleges eugen n. killed a turkish estate agent , kemal turan , with three shots to the head in december last year after luring him to waste ground near the western town of herne .
the turk , the prosecution says , had owed money to a member of eugen n. 's gang .
the gang leader is accused of killing three of his heroin suppliers in rotterdam after a disagreement a month later .

eugen n. and five eastern european men aged 21 to 27 are accused of killing the men following disagreements over drug deals .
the prosecution alleges eugen n. killed a turkish estate agent , kemal turan , with three shots to the head in december last year after luring him to waste ground near the western town of herne .
the turk , the prosecution says , had owed money to a member of eugen n. 's gang .
the gang leader is accused of killing three of his heroin suppliers in rotterdam after a disagreement a month later .
the final of the five murders is alleged to have taken place six days later , on january 22 , after eugen n. and one of his gang fell out with a dealer over a heroin sale near the city of cologne .
the man was shot three times in the back .
although he managed to flee the scene in a car , he died in hospital .
prosecutors also suspect the accused killed two brothers from georgia whose bodies were found in a forest near herne , although that investigation continues .
eugen n. moved to germany from russia with his parents aged 12 in 1996 and grew up in a tough neighborhood of mainly russian immigrants where violence was the only way to climb up the hierarchy , according to press reports .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.10.2004 germany 's bronze age blockbuster großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : archeologists have dated the disc to 1600 b.c. the 3,600 year old sky disk of nebra - the world 's oldest image of the cosmos - is the centerpiece of the biggest bronze age show of europe , in the eastern german town of halle . it caused a world-wide sensation when it was brought to the attention of the german public in 2002 , having been discovered in the state of saxony-anhalt two years earlier .
now the sky disc of nebra - a bronze disc with gold-leaf appliques representing the sun , moon , stars and a ship - is back in the limelight , at the opening of a blockbuster show entitled " the forged sky : the wide world in the heart of europe 3,600 years ago . "
for the first time the disc , which is around 32 centimeters -lrb- 12 inches -rrb- in diameter and weighs about 2 kilos -lrb- 1 pound -rrb- , will be on public view in its fully restored state .
1,600 artifacts in addition to oldest concrete representation of the cosmos known to date , the forged sky exhibit , at the state museum of prehistory in the town of halle , will feature the sun chariot of trundholm -lrb- denmark -rrb- and 1,600 more of the most important archeological finds representing europe in the bronze age .
when it was discovered , the sky disc was considered a key find not only for archaeology but also for astronomy and the history of religion .
deposited some 3,600 years ago , it was found on the summit of the mittelberg hill , near the wooded area of nebra in eastern germany , together with valuable swords , jewelry and tools .
the find initiated a new presentation of the bronze age world in central germany .
the natural riches of this region - copper , salt and fertile soils - formed the power basis for the resident early bronze age princes , who exchanged goods from all regions of europe .
mighty tombs , extensive bronze treasures , gold jewelry and unique display weapons survive as their status symbols , and a representative sample of them is pulled together for the current blockbuster show .
crowds expected " peoples ' interest in the disc since it was unearthed two years ago has not let up , " saxony-anhalt state archeologist harald meller told the dpa news agency .
he explained : " we put the show together in record time , 18 months . "
meller said he expects 100,000 people to visit the exhibit , which runs to april 24 .
if there is enough interest , he said , the show will be extended .
the objects on view have been donated by 68 museums in 18 countries .
" most of the objects , like burial offerings , cult objects , gold jewelry and various decorated armaments , have never before been out on loan , and they will only be gathered together like this for the show in halle , " meller told dpa .
aside from european countries , lebanon also loaned some pieces to the show .
sun chariots and golden boats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sun chariot of trundholm , denmark for example , the organizers got special permission to borrow the 3,400 year old sun chariot of trundholm from its home at the national museum in copenhagen , for the duration of the halle show .
the national museum had previously decided that , for security reasons , the 50 centimeter long , 30 centimeter high sun chariot should never again leave denmark .
similarly , the 88 super thin golden ships from nors , denmark , are so brittle that they hardly ever leave the national museum , according to museum director flemming kaul .
but having a group of artifacts from around europe is important , because " we show that ... there is a long process of developing knowledge about religion and astronomy in europe , which is part of the history of mankind , " meller said .
the disc itself was a cult object , and describes the world view during the bronze age .
people imagined the earth as a disc , with a dome-shaped sky covering it .
a cluster of seven dots has been interpreted as the pleiades constellation as it appeared 3,600 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a nebra baker made this reproduction of the sun disc out of butter cream and marzipan .
at the same time , the piece is thought to be related to primitive observatories , one of which is the " german stonehenge " in the nearby town of goseck .
archeologists believe the disc may have been used in the pre-calendar bronze age as an instrument for determining seasonal changes .
the popularity of the disc has led to a boom in reproductions .
demand for € 800 -lrb- $ 990 -rrb- copies of the disc is booming : " there are already 50 on order , and the fabricator can barely keep up with production , " meller said .
on the other hand , the disc 's popularity ca n't stanch the flood of lawsuits that followed its discovery .
although the copyright case was decided in favor of the state of saxony-anhalt , there is still a suit before the halle appeals courts against two suspected fencers from north rhine westphalia who claim the sky disc is a fake that was found outside of germany .
the disc was found on july 4 , 1999 from two convicted grave robbers .
in february , 2002 it was bought along with other bronze objects from art fencers in a police operation in switzerland . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : archaeologists unearth german stonehenge german experts hailed europe ’ s oldest astronomical observatory , discovered in saxony-anhalt last year , a “ milestone in archaeological research ” after the details of the sensational find were made public .

the study by accountancy firm deloitte found farmers are expected to earn an average of £ 84 per hectare , compared with £ 200 in 2003-04 .
but earnings from non-farming activities are rising , it said .
the main factors behind the " dramatic swings " in income were poor summer weather and world market conditions .
the report predicted the amount farmers earn from food production will become increasingly unpredictable , while returns on non-farming land uses look set to continue rising gently .
the professional can still make a good living mark hill , deloitte washout ' worse than foot-and-mouth ' mark hill , head of the deloitte food & agriculture group said : " for a 400 hectare farm , this means net farm income over three years will have swung from £ 17,000 to £ 80,000 and back to £ 33,600 . "
deloitte food and agriculture partner richard crane said 2003-04 was probably the first time in five years many farms had made money from growing food .
income from non-food production , such as tourism and property letting , has risen by £ 35 per hectare , according to the 2004 results .
the study also forecasts a steady income for farmers from tax-backed environmental schemes .
the deloitte farm results survey analysed the accounts of farms that represent around 100,000 hectares of lowland england .
rotting crops its forecast for the rest of 2004-05 takes account of a " very difficult " 2004 grain harvest and low prices .
this summer only about half the wheat in the country was harvested and entire fields of crops were left to rot because of prolonged heavy rainfall .
the report also said continued price pressure in the dairy industry would lead to another year of poor returns for milk producers .
bbc rural affairs correspondent tom heap said many farmers may decide the crop and livestock income is " too dodgy " and stop farming altogether .
mr hill added : " the professional can still make a good living .
our top farmers can expect to generate net farm more than twice the average .
" this level of return should be sufficient to invest in the continued development of the industry . "

rotting crops its forecast for the rest of 2004-05 takes account of a " very difficult " 2004 grain harvest and low prices .
this summer only about half the wheat in the country was harvested and entire fields of crops were left to rot because of prolonged heavy rainfall .
the report also said continued price pressure in the dairy industry would lead to another year of poor returns for milk producers .
bbc rural affairs correspondent tom heap said many farmers may decide the crop and livestock income is " too dodgy " and stop farming altogether .
mr hill added : " the professional can still make a good living .

the study by accountancy firm deloitte found farmers are expected to earn an average of £ 84 per hectare , compared with £ 200 in 2003-04 .
but earnings from non-farming activities are rising , it said .
the main factors behind the " dramatic swings " in income were poor summer weather and world market conditions .
the report predicted the amount farmers earn from food production will become increasingly unpredictable , while returns on non-farming land uses look set to continue rising gently . "
the professional can still make a good living " mark hill , deloitte mark hill , head of the deloitte food & agriculture group said : " for a 400 hectare farm , this means net farm income over three years will have swung from £ 17,000 to £ 80,000 and back to £ 33,600 . "
deloitte food and agriculture partner richard crane said 2003-04 was probably the first time in five years many farms had made money from growing food .
income from non-food production , such as tourism and property letting , has risen by £ 35 per hectare , according to the 2004 results .
the study also forecasts a steady income for farmers from tax-backed environmental schemes .

planning permission to redevelop the existing café , labelled " the highest slum in britain " by the prince of wales , was granted in january .
the proposed scheme will see it replaced by an £ 8m building finished in stone and glass .
aneurin phillips , chief executive of snowdonia national park authority -lrb- snpa -rrb- , said the contribution showed the importance of the project to the whole nation .
" not only will the residents and businesses within the communities of snowdonia benefit from this investment , north wales and wales as a whole will also benefit , " he said .

previous attempts to redevelop it failed because of a lack of cash .
work on the new building is expected to start next september , and finished by june 2007 .
the £ 3m from the assembly government will be added to £ 1.24m which has been secured by grant offers from the wales tourist board , welsh development agency and snowdon mountain railway .
other money will come from snowdonia national park authority , and applications are being made for the heritage lottery fund and objective one european funds .
