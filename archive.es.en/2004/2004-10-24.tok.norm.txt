meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .

in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "
no longer credit-wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards are gaining in acceptance in the past , germany was known as a society of savers .
credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .

a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .

" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .

the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metroplite affilohije , left , serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica , center , and parliament speaker predrag markovic , right , lead a protest march to st. sava orthodox temple , friday , march 19 , 2004 .
thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "
no longer credit-wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards are gaining in acceptance in the past , germany was known as a society of savers .
credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .

the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .
she said that germany 's private banks should be required to help borrowers struggling to keep up with payments , as it 's the banks that most profit from credit agreements . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debt clock moves next door to government after strolling past the exclusive boutiques on berlin 's friedrichstrasse , tourists , locals and cabinet members may find solace - or distress - in the capital 's newest sight : the rapidly ticking national debt clock .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metroplite affilohije , left , serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica , center , and parliament speaker predrag markovic , right , lead a protest march to st. sava orthodox temple , friday , march 19 , 2004 .
thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "
no longer credit-wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards are gaining in acceptance in the past , germany was known as a society of savers .
credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .
ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ethnic boycott mars kosovo election renewed ethnic tensions and uncertainty over final status talks overshadowed kosovo 's general election saturday , the second in the province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "
no longer credit-wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards are gaining in acceptance in the past , germany was known as a society of savers .
credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "
no longer credit-wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards are gaining in acceptance in the past , germany was known as a society of savers .
credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .
she said that germany 's private banks should be required to help borrowers struggling to keep up with payments , as it 's the banks that most profit from credit agreements . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debt clock moves next door to government after strolling past the exclusive boutiques on berlin 's friedrichstrasse , tourists , locals and cabinet members may find solace - or distress - in the capital 's newest sight : the rapidly ticking national debt clock .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "
no longer credit-wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards are gaining in acceptance in the past , germany was known as a society of savers .
credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "
no longer credit-wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards are gaining in acceptance in the past , germany was known as a society of savers .
credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .
she said that germany 's private banks should be required to help borrowers struggling to keep up with payments , as it 's the banks that most profit from credit agreements . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debt clock moves next door to government after strolling past the exclusive boutiques on berlin 's friedrichstrasse , tourists , locals and cabinet members may find solace - or distress - in the capital 's newest sight : the rapidly ticking national debt clock .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metroplite affilohije , left , serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica , center , and parliament speaker predrag markovic , right , lead a protest march to st. sava orthodox temple , friday , march 19 , 2004 .
thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .
ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ethnic boycott mars kosovo election renewed ethnic tensions and uncertainty over final status talks overshadowed kosovo 's general election saturday , the second in the province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "

credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .

in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "

but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "
no longer credit-wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards are gaining in acceptance in the past , germany was known as a society of savers .
credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .
she said that germany 's private banks should be required to help borrowers struggling to keep up with payments , as it 's the banks that most profit from credit agreements . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debt clock moves next door to government after strolling past the exclusive boutiques on berlin 's friedrichstrasse , tourists , locals and cabinet members may find solace - or distress - in the capital 's newest sight : the rapidly ticking national debt clock .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "
no longer credit-wary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit cards are gaining in acceptance in the past , germany was known as a society of savers .
credit cards were something of a rarity .
travelers hoping to get by with their visa or mastercard in germany frequently found they had to access cash to pay for goods and services .
but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "
in britain , borrowers are often tempted by ads and mass mailings from dubious firms offering quick , easy approval for credit cards and loans .
even the country 's big banks have been called before parliament , accused of pushing credit card debt on borrowers who ca n't afford it .
a similar phenomenon is becoming observable in germany .
as the number of people struggling with debt increases , so do the offers for quick credit .
malu dreyer says the states wo n't be able to keep up with the demand for debt counseling , particularly once germany 's latest labor market and welfare reforms are introduced in 2005 .
she said that germany 's private banks should be required to help borrowers struggling to keep up with payments , as it 's the banks that most profit from credit agreements . deanne corbett send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debt clock moves next door to government after strolling past the exclusive boutiques on berlin 's friedrichstrasse , tourists , locals and cabinet members may find solace - or distress - in the capital 's newest sight : the rapidly ticking national debt clock .

the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .
ethnic albanians demand complete independence from serbia but ethnic serbs and the government in belgrade insist that the territory is an inalienable part of the former yugoslav republic . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ethnic boycott mars kosovo election renewed ethnic tensions and uncertainty over final status talks overshadowed kosovo 's general election saturday , the second in the province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .

meanwhile , some states are freezing or cutting funding for debt counseling programs , leaving debtors in the lurch . it 's not uncommon for german families to have some form of debt , such as credit , a mortgage or a loan to finance bigger purchases .
but if a family experiences unemployment , divorce , or a lengthy illness , it 's often difficult to avoid the slippery slope toward unmanageable debt .
a new study by the ministry for families reveals that the number of households struggling with debt in germany is increasing .
in 1994 , around 2 million households were classed as overly in debt .
by 2002 , that number had risen to 3.1 million or 8.1 percent of all households .
" it 's a number we have to take very seriously , " said german family minister renate schmidt .
" debt can have bitter consequences for those affected by it , especially when they have children .
borrowers ca n't be allowed to stay in the trap of debt - they need a way out so they can lead normal lives again . "
the study defined being in debt as when an individual or family is unable to cover their costs or pay off their debts despite a permanent reduction in living standards .
once that stage is reached , debt quickly spirals out of control , said gunther zimmermann , a sociologist at karlsruhe university .
" if there 's no more money coming from the bank , then other debts for things such as rent and electricity quickly add up , " zimmermann said .
going bankrupt starting in 1999 , individuals and households in germany were given the option of registering bankruptcy , just as a company would .
those who pursue this option need the assistance of their local debt counselor , a service which is funded at the state level .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting in line but due to tough economic times , states are reluctant to put any more funding in debt counseling , despite the increase in the number of people who need the service .
in hesse , the state government has capped funding at € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- per year .
in bavaria , the debt counseling program is having to make do with a two-thirds reduction in funds .
the result is that many germans are being left alone with their problems , or facing waiting times of more than six months before they get an appointment .
" the federal states have to take their responsibility seriously and continue to fund debt counseling , " schmidt said .
" in addition to this , general financial education needs to become part of the school curriculum , so children learn how to handle money while they 're still young . "

but that 's starting to change .
while germany 's difficult economic situation is partly to blame for the increase in private debt , some experts say a change in the german mentality is also responsible .
malu dreyer , a state secretary in rheinland-palatinate 's ministry for social affairs , said she 's convinced that germans ' general willingness to take on debt - combined with fiscal irresponsibility - has grown .
" those affected by debt often do n't realize that they have to adapt their lifestyle if they 're suddenly confronted with having to get by on one income , " dreyer told the associated press news agency .
germany still has a long way to go , however , before it gets close to the record level of consumer debt in britain .
the bank of england estimates the collective household debt in britain at more than € 1.4 trillion - the equivalent of what is owed by africa , asia and latin america to international banks and through loans from other countries .
britain a leader in consumer debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britons do n't mind borrowing to shop britain 's national consumer council said around six million families are struggling with debt - twice the number affected in germany .
" the reason for this big difference is housing and housing credit , " martin weale , director of the britain 's national institute of economic and social research told dw-world .
" fewer germans own their houses , whereas in britain , two-thirds of people own houses , meaning mortgage credit is a really big form of borrowing . "

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .
he said that " there would have been more serb voters if those who wanted to have a monopoly over the kosovo serbs had not appeared , " in a reference to nationalist community leaders , still influential in the province .
some 200,000 serbs have left kosovo since the end of the war , faced with reprisal attacks by albanian extremists after more than a decade of serbian repression under former strongman slobodan milosevic .
only a handful of voters cast their ballots in serb areas .
in one polling station in the central village of gracanica , only three of 340 registered voters showed up at the polling station .

thousands of protesters marched peacefully in serbia in support of their ethnic kin in kosovo .
serbian prime minister vojislav kostunica as well as the serbian orthodox church backed the boycott , insisting that greater local autonomy was the only way to ensure security for non-albanians .
a turning point ?
jessen-petersen has said that the election marked a " turning point " and would set the stage for a un review of democracy standards early next year and possible talks on the province 's final status .
he insisted that only serb politicians who had taken part in the polls " are legitimate representatives " of the serb minority who could participate in any future talks on kosovo 's status .
the un has promised a review of kosovo 's progress in meeting standards of democracy and human rights which could eventually lead to a dialogue on the province 's final status .

his main rival , the democratic party of kosovo of former guerrilla leader hashim thaci , gained 27 percent , while the alliance for the future of kosovo of former guerrilla leader ramush haradinaj came third with eight percent , makolli said .
if the results were confirmed , no single party would be able to form a government and a future coalition government would have to be negotiated , as had been the case after the 2001 election .
first preliminary results were expected on monday .
the central electoral commission said turnout among kosovo 's 1.4 million voters was 53 percent .
but a massive boycott by the serb minority overshadowed the election , the second in the un-administered serbian province since the 1998-99 war between serbian forces and ethnic albanian separatists .
the vote for kosovo 's 120-seat assembly was seen as a test for the international community 's effort to build a multi-ethnic democracy in the southern serbian province which has been administered by the united nations since a nato bombing campaign forced belgrade to withdraw its troops in june 1999 .
serbs boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but as the polls closed it became clear that the vast majority of ethnic serbs had boycotted the vote to demand greater autonomy and security in the mainly ethnic albanian province .
some 2,000 extra nato peacekeepers were deployed to secure the election after 19 people died when an ethnic albanian mob rioted in serb-populated villages in march , in the worst unrest since the war .
despite the security fears un officials said no major incidents disturbed the election .
but kosovo 's chief un administrator soren jessen-petersen said pressure brought on the 80,000-strong serb minority was the main reason for the boycott .
" more serbs have decided not to vote because of the pressures , " jessen-petersen told reporters after the polls closed .

7 of 11 by 1991 , it was time for a change .
food riots led mr kaunda to allow multi-party elections , which he lost to former unionist frederick chiluba -lrb- left -rrb- , re-elected five years later .
8 of 11 mr chiluba promised higher living standards but these never materialised .
by 1999 , some 90,000 children were living rough on zambia 's streets - many orphaned by aids .
9 of 11 although mr kaunda presided over zambia 's economic decline , he was praised for being one of the first african leaders to acknowledge that one of his relatives had died from aids .
10 of 11 mr chiluba stood down in 2001 and was later charged with 80 counts of theft worth $ 40m .
these have now been scaled back to six counts , valued at $ 500,000 .
11 of 11 mr chiluba 's successor is trying to diversify the economy , but the future looks far from rosy , with more than six out of 10 zambians now living on less than a dollar a day .
south korea 's economy is now 100 times bigger than that of zambia .

lord chancellor lord falconer says witnesses and victims will be able to be screened from defendants or give evidence by video link .
the number of courts specialising in anti-social behaviour will increase from 12 to 41 .
lord falconer told the bbc the measures could be in place by next spring .
since anti-social behaviour orders -lrb- asbos -rrb- were introduced four years ago , 2,455 have been made in england and wales - less than the government had hoped .
asbos are fine , if they were brought in about 10 to 15 years ago norman brennan , victims of crime trust ' the intimidation was horrendous ' lord falconer , the minister in charge of courts , believes it is because many people are too frightened to give evidence against their own neighbours .
" if they are giving evidence against people who live in their own communities , that 's a terrifying and sometimes intimidating experience , " he told bbc news .
he said : " you need to give people confidence they will be protected . "
he said primary legislation already existed to give witnesses protection but would need to go through parliament to be extended to other courts .
lord falconer denied it was in " any sense geared " to the general election and said it could be on the law books by spring .
but victims of crime trust director norman brennan said asbos had come too late to make a difference in many cases .
some victims are too intimidated to complain , the government says " asbos are fine , if they were brought in about 10 to 15 years ago , " he told the bbc .
" we have allowed young offenders in particular to get away with so much crime and behave in such an appallingly bad way that now , by the time we implement asbos in some of these cases , they are beyond certain redemption .
" their behaviour is such -lsb- that -rsb- only a term of imprisonment or in a young offenders ' institution is the right punishment . "
and shadow home affairs minister cheryl gillan said the timing of the announcement was wrong .
she said it was " not backed up with resources or made to parliament so we have a chance to cross question the government on it " .
lord falconer 's announcement comes ahead of the publication of the review of year-old legislation brought in to deal with " street thuggery " , introduced by home secretary david blunkett .
it is expected to reveal a sharp rise in the use of asbos , dispersal orders , acceptable behaviour contracts and fixed penalty notices .

the princess royal trust for carers said more is now known about the number of children who care at home .
but the trust 's louise macdonald , speaking on bbc radio scotland 's sunday live show , said there was still a lack of awareness among officials .
ministers say they are doing their best and have increased funding help from £ 5m to £ 21m in four years .
one young carer is 14-year-old alan from west lothian .
he told the sunday live programme , which was broadcast at 0900 bst on sunday , about how he helps his problem brother scott .
click here to listen to sunday live 's report and debate on the story the boys ' mother works part-time so when she is not at home , alan is in charge .
he said : " my brother is asthmatic , epileptic and sufferers from adhd .
" that means he is hyperactive , he can not concentrate a great deal and you have to watch him all the time .
" he goes to the cooker when it is on , i tell him not to do it , but he still does it . "
it 's quite easy , when i was wee i did n't know what to do , but i know what to do now brenda mclaughlin , 15 the children 's father walked out on the family when scott was just four-months-old .
" it 's hard for my mother to bring up two children on her own , " said alan .
ms macdonald said the research done on the numbers of young people taking on caring roles was revealing .
" i do n't think we ever realised before that so many young people were actually caught to this extent in this caring role .
" so , i think that lots more could be done by local authorities , i think the scottish executive could give a much clearer lead to local authorities as to how young carers could be supported .
' nothing stops us ' " but i really do believe that there is a lack of awareness on their part about the numbers involved , " said ms macdonald .
former scottish national party leader john swinney has also called on the government to give more support to young carers .
mr swinney , who stood down as snp leader in september , will lead a members debate at the scottish parliament next week on the issue of young carers .
john swinney is a former leader of the snp the north tayside msp said : " the government , to be fair , has given an increased amount of support to carers ' projects over the past few years .
" i think we 've got to live in the real world and recognise that this support is not nearly touching all of the services that are required to be put in place .
he said the executive had a responsibility to make sure there were " respite places for young people , support in place for assisting educational development and more support in the home " .
brenda mclaughlin is 15 and looks after her blind grandparents , nan and gerry .
she has lived with them since she was an infant .
nan said : " we ca n't see , it 's even difficult to walk across the floor in a room .
" but with brenda , nothing stops us - we go on holiday , we do everything you can think of .
the trust believes young carers are not getting the support they need " she reads the labels at the shops and she 's very good at spotting a bargain . "
although brenda 's grandparents make sure she goes to school and plays with her friends , life is full of responsibility .
brenda for example has to dish out the daily medication , including blood pressure and diabetes tablets , to her grandmother .
the teenager said : " i do the dishes , i cook the tea , i do the shopping and i wash out my budgie 's cage .
" it 's quite easy , when i was wee i did n't know what to do , but i know what to do now . "
pick up signs her grandfather gerry said he believes life would be very different for brenda if there was more help for him and his wife in their home .
the scottish executive said it was committed to helping young carers look after themselves , as well as the people they care for .
they have set up the carers strategy which is designed to create a more coherent joined up approach to deal with problems .
but they have acknowledged that more could be done to co-ordinate services on offer .
an executive spokeswoman added : " we are working closely with national carers ' organisations to improve the available support for all carers , including young carers , and we are investing record amounts to achieve this .
" we plan to work with key stakeholders to improve the support for young carers and we will look at how best this can be done .
later this year we will issue revised guidance on the planning and delivery of services for children and young people in need . "
