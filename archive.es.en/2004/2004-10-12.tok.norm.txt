his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

some of the country 's human rights activists beg to differ . on the door leading into hünsü öndül 's office there are seven bullet holes , each circled in black marker .
inside the office of the president of the turkish human rights association there are two more on the bookcase , and another in a chair . the murder attempt by a paramilitary group took place in 1998 , when his predecessor sat behind the simple wooden desk .
akin birdal escaped the assassination attempt , but the event 's horrifying legacy remains . " we decided to keep this door , as a sort of bad memory , " öndül told dw-world . see-saw battle that 's not to say all recent memories have been good .
since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül . " in the last five years , the operations against us are not physical , but are done through the law , " said öndül . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kemal atatürk bridge in istanbul the words are unwelcome in the halls of turkish government buildings nowadays .
in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .
the death penalty has been eliminated , rights given to turkey 's large kurdish minority and laws passed that aim to stop systematic torture in turkish prisons .
the steps are among the reasons the eu 's executive body last week recommended the european union take up membership negotiations with turkey in the near future . now it 's up to european leaders to give final approval when they meet in december . just a little " ill treatment " the country 's chances are good .
what prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has achieved through his akp party 's absolute parliamentary majority , has taken the country light years ahead , say western diplomats and observers .
" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .
in a recent interview with a group of journalists , erdogan reacted testily to a question that suggested torture was still widespread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister recep tayyip erdogan " if you want to see what is happening please be my guest and come to turkey and investigate for yourself , " erdogan said , echoing a speech he gave before the european parliament .
" because a claim is not enough on this position .
the claim has to be proven . " numbers say torture still widespread öndül is happy to do so .
according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .
" democratization in turkey is unavoidable , " said öndül , before ushering a few reporters out of his office .

some of the country 's human rights activists beg to differ . on the door leading into hünsü öndül 's office there are seven bullet holes , each circled in black marker .
inside the office of the president of the turkish human rights association there are two more on the bookcase , and another in a chair . the murder attempt by a paramilitary group took place in 1998 , when his predecessor sat behind the simple wooden desk .
akin birdal escaped the assassination attempt , but the event 's horrifying legacy remains . " we decided to keep this door , as a sort of bad memory , " öndül told dw-world . see-saw battle that 's not to say all recent memories have been good .
since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 italian eu commissioner rejected for conservative views großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does it matter if he believes homosexuality is a sin ?
the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .

5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .

some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.10.2004 germany mulls tanks sale to turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military no longer needs the tanks barely a week after the european commission recommended initiating membership talks with turkey , the german government is reportedly considering to deliver tanks to that country . government officials are mulling the shipment of several hundred leopard 2 tanks to turkey , according to the financial times deutschland newspaper . the german defense ministry has denied any such plans , adding that turkish officials have n't made an official request so far . but german defence minister peter struck said last week that the progress turkey has made on opening negotiations to join the european union mean arms sales should no longer be a taboo subject . the bundeswehr , the german military , no longer needs the tanks , which were built for combat in central europe 's open and flat regions .
the vehicles no longer suit the military 's new concept of being able to quickly respond to crisis situations abroad . five years ago , the proposal to sell the tanks to turkey already provoked one of the worst conflicts within germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens . at the time , the then parliamentary leader of the greens , kerstin müller , voiced her party 's concerns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 italian eu commissioner rejected for conservative views großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does it matter if he believes homosexuality is a sin ?
the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .
1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .
some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission , neelie kroes , has also faced objection from several quarters for her past connection to big business .
although the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs has noted a potential conflict of interest , it did not reject her nomination . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu commission faces intense grilling the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .

" they can threaten to cut jobs and close plants , " hartwig oertel , a spokesman for the metalworkers ' union ig metall in frankfurt told reporters , according to reuters news service . that 's why workers had to use a different strategy , focusing on the damage to the company 's image and brand loyalty a plant closure would have .
he added that highly qualified workers in germany were another reason for opel to stay there .
while equally concerned about job security in bochum , that plant 's workers ' council leader said he did n't expect layoffs to happen until 2006 .

ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .

more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "

ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .

france and germany are certainly not alone in improving business ties with the asian powerhouse .

more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "

german foreign minister joschka fischer , who is in favor of removing the ban , said on monday china had demonstrated it was on the road to improving its human rights records .
it was now up to the eu , to the european parliament and to the council of ministers to determine whether the improvements justified lifting the embargo .

and the interest seems to be mutual , with the chinese foreign ministry dubbing a new trade policy initiative " the year of europe . "
according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .
more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "
" president chirac 's remarks conveniently ignore china 's obligations under international human rights law , " the activist group said in a statement monday .

" crimes against humanity such as those committed by the nazis in world war ii , under apartheid in south africa and during the genocide in rwanda , are not diminished or erased by the mere passage of years or even decades , " said the group , which is also lobbying the eu to keep a weapons embargo in place .
continued ban on arms trade the weapons ban , which was imposed after the tiananmen square massacre 15 years ago , has been a subject of much debate between brussels and beijing , with french president chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder endorsing its removal .
although the bloc 's foreign ministers on monday agreed to keep the embargo in place , the eu 's dutch presidency said it may be heading towards a revision of that decision in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinesische soldiers on parade " we hope to be able to indicate a positive orientation towards lifting , " dutch foreign minister bernanrd told reporters after a meeting in luxembourg .
he said the 25-member bloc was studying in particular how to strengthen a self-imposed eu code of conduct on weapons sales , to ensure that arms were not sold for dubious purposes if the embargo were lifted .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who is in favor of removing the ban , said on monday china had demonstrated it was on the road to improving its human rights records .
it was now up to the eu , to the european parliament and to the council of ministers to determine whether the improvements justified lifting the embargo .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country has been one of the most reluctant to remove the ban , said earlier monday that the eu could consider lifting the arms embargo only in a " proper and sensible way .

the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .

the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .

ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , and eu commission president romano prodi during a conference at the eu commission may 6 , 2004 .
france and germany are certainly not alone in improving business ties with the asian powerhouse .
in the past year , the european union has focused on increasing trade and investment in china .
as a bloc , the eu surpassed the united states in direct foreign investment in china for the first time in 2003 .
and the interest seems to be mutual , with the chinese foreign ministry dubbing a new trade policy initiative " the year of europe . "
according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .

ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , and eu commission president romano prodi during a conference at the eu commission may 6 , 2004 .
france and germany are certainly not alone in improving business ties with the asian powerhouse .
in the past year , the european union has focused on increasing trade and investment in china .
as a bloc , the eu surpassed the united states in direct foreign investment in china for the first time in 2003 .
and the interest seems to be mutual , with the chinese foreign ministry dubbing a new trade policy initiative " the year of europe . "
according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .
more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .

the discussion is a " declaration of war , " they say . populism is not diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel 's suggestion lacks even the slightest scrap of reason , instead scraping the barrel of the lowest kind of populism .
but populism can not be a guideline of political diplomacy .
it ca n't take the place of informed debate .
would anyone in germany actually want to rebuild the berlin wall - automatic firing devices and all - simply because polls show more and more people who are upset with the economic situation in the country want their wall back ? eu expansion to the east and southeast is a necessary , and thus correct , decision .
for a long time now , the eu has been more than just a group of nations seeking to improve economic conditions for its members .
it has become a federation that seeks to solidify and promote certain systems and values : democracy , human rights , protection of minorities , and a dialogue between cultures and religions .
and it seeks to do this far beyond the geographic borders of europe . this is exactly why a decision for or against turkish accession to the european union is such an important test of whether europeans are serious about having more decision-making power - and greater influence - on the world stage . test case in other words , turkey is a test case for whether germany and the european union can really take on a role of " global player . "
but politicians and countries that call for a popular " yes / no " referendum on the matter of turkish accession -lrb- such as french president jacques chirac -rrb- seem to lack the necessary maturity to take on such a role . even more primitive is the idea of the christian democrats in germany to start a petition drive . the suggestion has , rightly , met with loud opposition in germany ; in the current government and within the ruling parties , but also within the union .
thus , acting union floor leader wolfgang bosbach speaks of " misunderstandings " and a " queasy feeling " in the face of his party leader 's newest idea . jumping the gun never mind that bosbach himself is opposed to turkish entry into the european union , because he fears turkish accession will lead to more terror inside europe .
this fear is in itself baseless , since the blasphemy of terrorism is not bound by religion or culture , and kills irrespective of a person 's political or religious beliefs . the question remains : is such a polarization necessary just now ?
because up to now , it has n't even been definitively decided whether to being accession talks , let alone allow turkey imminent eu entry . it will be at least 15 years before this question needs to be addressed - if it ever needs to be addressed .
in other words , there is plenty of time for a political and societal discussion on the basis of fact .
the only sure thing now is : there are plenty of good reasons to be in favor of accession , and also several understandable fears that speak against turkey 's entry into the eu . the union suggestion paves the way to a spiral of opposing positions that could lead to excesses that would harm germany 's carefully-groomed image of being an enlightened , humanitarian , and tolerant democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right-wing fire attack on a home inhabited by turks in may 1993 in solingen killed five people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 opinion : anti-turkish petition drive misguided großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the petition would be seen as a vote against germany 's 2.5 million turks with her plan to start a petition drive against turkey 's eu entry , the head of germany 's largest opposition party risks a dangerous polarization and stirs up old memories , writes dw-world 's baha güngör . a petition campaign opposing turkish entry into the eu - as recently suggested by opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leader angela merkel - would be seen as many as a german vote against the turkish nation and culture . and also as a vote for or against the turkish people - 2.5 million of whom currently live and work in germany , with 4 million living and working in the european union as a whole . turks in germany say they feel deeply wounded by the suggestion of the petition drive , and rightly so .
the discussion is a " declaration of war , " they say . populism is not diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel 's suggestion lacks even the slightest scrap of reason , instead scraping the barrel of the lowest kind of populism .
but populism can not be a guideline of political diplomacy .
it ca n't take the place of informed debate .
would anyone in germany actually want to rebuild the berlin wall - automatic firing devices and all - simply because polls show more and more people who are upset with the economic situation in the country want their wall back ? eu expansion to the east and southeast is a necessary , and thus correct , decision .
for a long time now , the eu has been more than just a group of nations seeking to improve economic conditions for its members .
it has become a federation that seeks to solidify and promote certain systems and values : democracy , human rights , protection of minorities , and a dialogue between cultures and religions .
and it seeks to do this far beyond the geographic borders of europe . this is exactly why a decision for or against turkish accession to the european union is such an important test of whether europeans are serious about having more decision-making power - and greater influence - on the world stage . test case in other words , turkey is a test case for whether germany and the european union can really take on a role of " global player . "
but politicians and countries that call for a popular " yes / no " referendum on the matter of turkish accession -lrb- such as french president jacques chirac -rrb- seem to lack the necessary maturity to take on such a role . even more primitive is the idea of the christian democrats in germany to start a petition drive . the suggestion has , rightly , met with loud opposition in germany ; in the current government and within the ruling parties , but also within the union .
thus , acting union floor leader wolfgang bosbach speaks of " misunderstandings " and a " queasy feeling " in the face of his party leader 's newest idea . jumping the gun never mind that bosbach himself is opposed to turkish entry into the european union , because he fears turkish accession will lead to more terror inside europe .
this fear is in itself baseless , since the blasphemy of terrorism is not bound by religion or culture , and kills irrespective of a person 's political or religious beliefs . the question remains : is such a polarization necessary just now ?
because up to now , it has n't even been definitively decided whether to being accession talks , let alone allow turkey imminent eu entry . it will be at least 15 years before this question needs to be addressed - if it ever needs to be addressed .
in other words , there is plenty of time for a political and societal discussion on the basis of fact .
the only sure thing now is : there are plenty of good reasons to be in favor of accession , and also several understandable fears that speak against turkey 's entry into the eu . the union suggestion paves the way to a spiral of opposing positions that could lead to excesses that would harm germany 's carefully-groomed image of being an enlightened , humanitarian , and tolerant democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right-wing fire attack on a home inhabited by turks in may 1993 in solingen killed five people .

for a long time now , the eu has been more than just a group of nations seeking to improve economic conditions for its members .
it has become a federation that seeks to solidify and promote certain systems and values : democracy , human rights , protection of minorities , and a dialogue between cultures and religions .

"
but politicians and countries that call for a popular " yes / no " referendum on the matter of turkish accession -lrb- such as french president jacques chirac -rrb- seem to lack the necessary maturity to take on such a role . even more primitive is the idea of the christian democrats in germany to start a petition drive . the suggestion has , rightly , met with loud opposition in germany ; in the current government and within the ruling parties , but also within the union .
thus , acting union floor leader wolfgang bosbach speaks of " misunderstandings " and a " queasy feeling " in the face of his party leader 's newest idea . jumping the gun never mind that bosbach himself is opposed to turkish entry into the european union , because he fears turkish accession will lead to more terror inside europe .
this fear is in itself baseless , since the blasphemy of terrorism is not bound by religion or culture , and kills irrespective of a person 's political or religious beliefs . the question remains : is such a polarization necessary just now ?
because up to now , it has n't even been definitively decided whether to being accession talks , let alone allow turkey imminent eu entry . it will be at least 15 years before this question needs to be addressed - if it ever needs to be addressed .
in other words , there is plenty of time for a political and societal discussion on the basis of fact .
the only sure thing now is : there are plenty of good reasons to be in favor of accession , and also several understandable fears that speak against turkey 's entry into the eu . the union suggestion paves the way to a spiral of opposing positions that could lead to excesses that would harm germany 's carefully-groomed image of being an enlightened , humanitarian , and tolerant democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right-wing fire attack on a home inhabited by turks in may 1993 in solingen killed five people .

would anyone in germany actually want to rebuild the berlin wall - automatic firing devices and all - simply because polls show more and more people who are upset with the economic situation in the country want their wall back ? eu expansion to the east and southeast is a necessary , and thus correct , decision .
for a long time now , the eu has been more than just a group of nations seeking to improve economic conditions for its members .
it has become a federation that seeks to solidify and promote certain systems and values : democracy , human rights , protection of minorities , and a dialogue between cultures and religions .
and it seeks to do this far beyond the geographic borders of europe . this is exactly why a decision for or against turkish accession to the european union is such an important test of whether europeans are serious about having more decision-making power - and greater influence - on the world stage . test case in other words , turkey is a test case for whether germany and the european union can really take on a role of " global player . "
but politicians and countries that call for a popular " yes / no " referendum on the matter of turkish accession -lrb- such as french president jacques chirac -rrb- seem to lack the necessary maturity to take on such a role . even more primitive is the idea of the christian democrats in germany to start a petition drive . the suggestion has , rightly , met with loud opposition in germany ; in the current government and within the ruling parties , but also within the union .
thus , acting union floor leader wolfgang bosbach speaks of " misunderstandings " and a " queasy feeling " in the face of his party leader 's newest idea . jumping the gun never mind that bosbach himself is opposed to turkish entry into the european union , because he fears turkish accession will lead to more terror inside europe .
this fear is in itself baseless , since the blasphemy of terrorism is not bound by religion or culture , and kills irrespective of a person 's political or religious beliefs . the question remains : is such a polarization necessary just now ?
because up to now , it has n't even been definitively decided whether to being accession talks , let alone allow turkey imminent eu entry . it will be at least 15 years before this question needs to be addressed - if it ever needs to be addressed .
in other words , there is plenty of time for a political and societal discussion on the basis of fact .
the only sure thing now is : there are plenty of good reasons to be in favor of accession , and also several understandable fears that speak against turkey 's entry into the eu . the union suggestion paves the way to a spiral of opposing positions that could lead to excesses that would harm germany 's carefully-groomed image of being an enlightened , humanitarian , and tolerant democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right-wing fire attack on a home inhabited by turks in may 1993 in solingen killed five people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 italian eu commissioner rejected for conservative views großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does it matter if he believes homosexuality is a sin ?
the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .
1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .
some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission , neelie kroes , has also faced objection from several quarters for her past connection to big business .
although the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs has noted a potential conflict of interest , it did not reject her nomination . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu commission faces intense grilling the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .

" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .

but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 italian eu commissioner rejected for conservative views großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does it matter if he believes homosexuality is a sin ?
the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .

the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .

stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 italian eu commissioner rejected for conservative views großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does it matter if he believes homosexuality is a sin ?
the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .
1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .
some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .

" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .

some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .

" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .

1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .
some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission , neelie kroes , has also faced objection from several quarters for her past connection to big business .

on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 12.10.2004 attacking the " land of plenty " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michelle williams plays lana in " land of plenty " german film director wim wenders has never been known to make easy to digest movies .
his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

the vehicles no longer suit the military 's new concept of being able to quickly respond to crisis situations abroad . five years ago , the proposal to sell the tanks to turkey already provoked one of the worst conflicts within germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens . at the time , the then parliamentary leader of the greens , kerstin müller , voiced her party 's concerns . " we think this is the wrong decision , " she said .
the greens ' resistance eventually blocked the sale of 1,000 leopard 2 tanks for about € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- . now , the junior coalition partner is once again raising questions about a possible deal with turkey . " the european commission recommends negotiations -lrb- with turkey -rrb- and germany starts talking about tanks , " said claudia roth , the party 's new co-chair , adding that the discussion left a bad taste in her mouth . no automatic approval roth added that she was n't necessarily opposed to a sale . but " there 's no blank check for a single country in the world - no eu country , no nato country , " she said , adding that the commission 's recommendation on turkey did not automatically justify an arms sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " every single application has to be examined and then people will have to make a decision , " roth -lrb- photo -rrb- said . germany had previously rejected arms sales to turkey because of concerns about the oppression of the country 's kurdish minority .

some of the country 's human rights activists beg to differ . on the door leading into hünsü öndül 's office there are seven bullet holes , each circled in black marker .
inside the office of the president of the turkish human rights association there are two more on the bookcase , and another in a chair . the murder attempt by a paramilitary group took place in 1998 , when his predecessor sat behind the simple wooden desk .
akin birdal escaped the assassination attempt , but the event 's horrifying legacy remains . " we decided to keep this door , as a sort of bad memory , " öndül told dw-world . see-saw battle that 's not to say all recent memories have been good .
since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül . " in the last five years , the operations against us are not physical , but are done through the law , " said öndül . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kemal atatürk bridge in istanbul the words are unwelcome in the halls of turkish government buildings nowadays .
in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .
the death penalty has been eliminated , rights given to turkey 's large kurdish minority and laws passed that aim to stop systematic torture in turkish prisons .
the steps are among the reasons the eu 's executive body last week recommended the european union take up membership negotiations with turkey in the near future . now it 's up to european leaders to give final approval when they meet in december . just a little " ill treatment " the country 's chances are good .
what prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has achieved through his akp party 's absolute parliamentary majority , has taken the country light years ahead , say western diplomats and observers .
" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .
in a recent interview with a group of journalists , erdogan reacted testily to a question that suggested torture was still widespread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister recep tayyip erdogan " if you want to see what is happening please be my guest and come to turkey and investigate for yourself , " erdogan said , echoing a speech he gave before the european parliament .
" because a claim is not enough on this position .
the claim has to be proven . " numbers say torture still widespread öndül is happy to do so .
according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .
1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .
some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission , neelie kroes , has also faced objection from several quarters for her past connection to big business .
although the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs has noted a potential conflict of interest , it did not reject her nomination . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu commission faces intense grilling the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .

german car maker opel , the loss-making subsidiary of general motors , is to axe 6,000-7,000 jobs from a total german workforce of around 12,000 , according to news reports . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- plans to axe a total 12,000 jobs in europe , or nearly one in five of its 62,000-strong european workforce , with germany to bear the brunt of the cuts , the financial times reported quoting gm sources . the job cuts are to be announced on thursday when gm unveils its plans to restructure its loss-making european activities , which alongside opel include saab in sweden and vauxhall in britain , the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported separately . the german paper also put the number of jobs on the line at 6,000-7,000 . gm 's european brands have lost more than € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- over the last four years , including several hundred million euros this year , according to the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung . two of gm 's biggest european factories - opel 's rüsselheim plant in the central german state of hesse and saab 's trollhättan site in sweden - were under threat of closure , according to the financial times . gm executives have been growing increasingly frustrated at regulatory and labor restrictions in europe .

north rhine-westphalian economics minister harald schartau said the state government could help with bureaucratic issues but not with money . union leaders said they realized employers had much more power in the matter . " they can threaten to cut jobs and close plants , " hartwig oertel , a spokesman for the metalworkers ' union ig metall in frankfurt told reporters , according to reuters news service . that 's why workers had to use a different strategy , focusing on the damage to the company 's image and brand loyalty a plant closure would have .
he added that highly qualified workers in germany were another reason for opel to stay there .
while equally concerned about job security in bochum , that plant 's workers ' council leader said he did n't expect layoffs to happen until 2006 .

ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .

france and germany are certainly not alone in improving business ties with the asian powerhouse .
in the past year , the european union has focused on increasing trade and investment in china .
as a bloc , the eu surpassed the united states in direct foreign investment in china for the first time in 2003 .
and the interest seems to be mutual , with the chinese foreign ministry dubbing a new trade policy initiative " the year of europe . "
according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .
more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "
" president chirac 's remarks conveniently ignore china 's obligations under international human rights law , " the activist group said in a statement monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese paramilitary police march onto beijing 's tiananmen square to perform the flag raising ceremony on june 4 , 2004 , the 15th anniversary of the military crackdown on democracy protesters .
" crimes against humanity such as those committed by the nazis in world war ii , under apartheid in south africa and during the genocide in rwanda , are not diminished or erased by the mere passage of years or even decades , " said the group , which is also lobbying the eu to keep a weapons embargo in place .
continued ban on arms trade the weapons ban , which was imposed after the tiananmen square massacre 15 years ago , has been a subject of much debate between brussels and beijing , with french president chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder endorsing its removal .
although the bloc 's foreign ministers on monday agreed to keep the embargo in place , the eu 's dutch presidency said it may be heading towards a revision of that decision in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 italian eu commissioner rejected for conservative views großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does it matter if he believes homosexuality is a sin ?
the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .
1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .

some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .

ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .

france and germany are certainly not alone in improving business ties with the asian powerhouse .
in the past year , the european union has focused on increasing trade and investment in china .
as a bloc , the eu surpassed the united states in direct foreign investment in china for the first time in 2003 .
and the interest seems to be mutual , with the chinese foreign ministry dubbing a new trade policy initiative " the year of europe . "
according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .
more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "
" president chirac 's remarks conveniently ignore china 's obligations under international human rights law , " the activist group said in a statement monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese paramilitary police march onto beijing 's tiananmen square to perform the flag raising ceremony on june 4 , 2004 , the 15th anniversary of the military crackdown on democracy protesters .
" crimes against humanity such as those committed by the nazis in world war ii , under apartheid in south africa and during the genocide in rwanda , are not diminished or erased by the mere passage of years or even decades , " said the group , which is also lobbying the eu to keep a weapons embargo in place .
continued ban on arms trade the weapons ban , which was imposed after the tiananmen square massacre 15 years ago , has been a subject of much debate between brussels and beijing , with french president chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder endorsing its removal .
although the bloc 's foreign ministers on monday agreed to keep the embargo in place , the eu 's dutch presidency said it may be heading towards a revision of that decision in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinesische soldiers on parade " we hope to be able to indicate a positive orientation towards lifting , " dutch foreign minister bernanrd told reporters after a meeting in luxembourg .
he said the 25-member bloc was studying in particular how to strengthen a self-imposed eu code of conduct on weapons sales , to ensure that arms were not sold for dubious purposes if the embargo were lifted .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who is in favor of removing the ban , said on monday china had demonstrated it was on the road to improving its human rights records .
it was now up to the eu , to the european parliament and to the council of ministers to determine whether the improvements justified lifting the embargo .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country has been one of the most reluctant to remove the ban , said earlier monday that the eu could consider lifting the arms embargo only in a " proper and sensible way .

the discussion is a " declaration of war , " they say . populism is not diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel 's suggestion lacks even the slightest scrap of reason , instead scraping the barrel of the lowest kind of populism .
but populism can not be a guideline of political diplomacy .
it ca n't take the place of informed debate .
would anyone in germany actually want to rebuild the berlin wall - automatic firing devices and all - simply because polls show more and more people who are upset with the economic situation in the country want their wall back ? eu expansion to the east and southeast is a necessary , and thus correct , decision .
for a long time now , the eu has been more than just a group of nations seeking to improve economic conditions for its members .
it has become a federation that seeks to solidify and promote certain systems and values : democracy , human rights , protection of minorities , and a dialogue between cultures and religions .
and it seeks to do this far beyond the geographic borders of europe . this is exactly why a decision for or against turkish accession to the european union is such an important test of whether europeans are serious about having more decision-making power - and greater influence - on the world stage . test case in other words , turkey is a test case for whether germany and the european union can really take on a role of " global player . "
but politicians and countries that call for a popular " yes / no " referendum on the matter of turkish accession -lrb- such as french president jacques chirac -rrb- seem to lack the necessary maturity to take on such a role . even more primitive is the idea of the christian democrats in germany to start a petition drive . the suggestion has , rightly , met with loud opposition in germany ; in the current government and within the ruling parties , but also within the union .
thus , acting union floor leader wolfgang bosbach speaks of " misunderstandings " and a " queasy feeling " in the face of his party leader 's newest idea . jumping the gun never mind that bosbach himself is opposed to turkish entry into the european union , because he fears turkish accession will lead to more terror inside europe .
this fear is in itself baseless , since the blasphemy of terrorism is not bound by religion or culture , and kills irrespective of a person 's political or religious beliefs . the question remains : is such a polarization necessary just now ?
because up to now , it has n't even been definitively decided whether to being accession talks , let alone allow turkey imminent eu entry . it will be at least 15 years before this question needs to be addressed - if it ever needs to be addressed .
in other words , there is plenty of time for a political and societal discussion on the basis of fact .
the only sure thing now is : there are plenty of good reasons to be in favor of accession , and also several understandable fears that speak against turkey 's entry into the eu . the union suggestion paves the way to a spiral of opposing positions that could lead to excesses that would harm germany 's carefully-groomed image of being an enlightened , humanitarian , and tolerant democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right-wing fire attack on a home inhabited by turks in may 1993 in solingen killed five people .
there is the danger that populism aimed at lampooning a people , its culture and religion , could have incalculable results : unruly masses shouting " turks get out " in germany 's streets ; boycotts of turkish stores , and perhaps even physical attacks on turks -lrb- throwing stones , torching shops and apartments . -rrb-
such actions would not only wake recent memories of victims of racist fire attacks in mölln und solingen , but also memories of november 9th .

the vehicles no longer suit the military 's new concept of being able to quickly respond to crisis situations abroad . five years ago , the proposal to sell the tanks to turkey already provoked one of the worst conflicts within germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens . at the time , the then parliamentary leader of the greens , kerstin müller , voiced her party 's concerns . " we think this is the wrong decision , " she said .
the greens ' resistance eventually blocked the sale of 1,000 leopard 2 tanks for about € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- . now , the junior coalition partner is once again raising questions about a possible deal with turkey . " the european commission recommends negotiations -lrb- with turkey -rrb- and germany starts talking about tanks , " said claudia roth , the party 's new co-chair , adding that the discussion left a bad taste in her mouth . no automatic approval roth added that she was n't necessarily opposed to a sale . but " there 's no blank check for a single country in the world - no eu country , no nato country , " she said , adding that the commission 's recommendation on turkey did not automatically justify an arms sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " every single application has to be examined and then people will have to make a decision , " roth -lrb- photo -rrb- said . germany had previously rejected arms sales to turkey because of concerns about the oppression of the country 's kurdish minority .

the vehicles no longer suit the military 's new concept of being able to quickly respond to crisis situations abroad . five years ago , the proposal to sell the tanks to turkey already provoked one of the worst conflicts within germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens . at the time , the then parliamentary leader of the greens , kerstin müller , voiced her party 's concerns . " we think this is the wrong decision , " she said .
the greens ' resistance eventually blocked the sale of 1,000 leopard 2 tanks for about € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- . now , the junior coalition partner is once again raising questions about a possible deal with turkey . " the european commission recommends negotiations -lrb- with turkey -rrb- and germany starts talking about tanks , " said claudia roth , the party 's new co-chair , adding that the discussion left a bad taste in her mouth . no automatic approval roth added that she was n't necessarily opposed to a sale . but " there 's no blank check for a single country in the world - no eu country , no nato country , " she said , adding that the commission 's recommendation on turkey did not automatically justify an arms sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " every single application has to be examined and then people will have to make a decision , " roth -lrb- photo -rrb- said . germany had previously rejected arms sales to turkey because of concerns about the oppression of the country 's kurdish minority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 europe remains skeptical of china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-chinese business ties are not enough to convince all of the eu while a flurry of eu delegations pay tribute to beijing 's growing economic prowess , many still harbor reservations about china 's human rights record as evidenced by brussels ' recent decision to continue the arms embargo . berlin and paris have been vying to strengthen their economic interests in china over the last several days .
ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , and eu commission president romano prodi during a conference at the eu commission may 6 , 2004 .
france and germany are certainly not alone in improving business ties with the asian powerhouse .
in the past year , the european union has focused on increasing trade and investment in china .
as a bloc , the eu surpassed the united states in direct foreign investment in china for the first time in 2003 .
and the interest seems to be mutual , with the chinese foreign ministry dubbing a new trade policy initiative " the year of europe . "
according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .
more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "
" president chirac 's remarks conveniently ignore china 's obligations under international human rights law , " the activist group said in a statement monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese paramilitary police march onto beijing 's tiananmen square to perform the flag raising ceremony on june 4 , 2004 , the 15th anniversary of the military crackdown on democracy protesters .
" crimes against humanity such as those committed by the nazis in world war ii , under apartheid in south africa and during the genocide in rwanda , are not diminished or erased by the mere passage of years or even decades , " said the group , which is also lobbying the eu to keep a weapons embargo in place .
continued ban on arms trade the weapons ban , which was imposed after the tiananmen square massacre 15 years ago , has been a subject of much debate between brussels and beijing , with french president chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder endorsing its removal .
although the bloc 's foreign ministers on monday agreed to keep the embargo in place , the eu 's dutch presidency said it may be heading towards a revision of that decision in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinesische soldiers on parade " we hope to be able to indicate a positive orientation towards lifting , " dutch foreign minister bernanrd told reporters after a meeting in luxembourg .
he said the 25-member bloc was studying in particular how to strengthen a self-imposed eu code of conduct on weapons sales , to ensure that arms were not sold for dubious purposes if the embargo were lifted .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who is in favor of removing the ban , said on monday china had demonstrated it was on the road to improving its human rights records .
it was now up to the eu , to the european parliament and to the council of ministers to determine whether the improvements justified lifting the embargo .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country has been one of the most reluctant to remove the ban , said earlier monday that the eu could consider lifting the arms embargo only in a " proper and sensible way .

the discussion is a " declaration of war , " they say . populism is not diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel 's suggestion lacks even the slightest scrap of reason , instead scraping the barrel of the lowest kind of populism .

would anyone in germany actually want to rebuild the berlin wall - automatic firing devices and all - simply because polls show more and more people who are upset with the economic situation in the country want their wall back ? eu expansion to the east and southeast is a necessary , and thus correct , decision .
for a long time now , the eu has been more than just a group of nations seeking to improve economic conditions for its members .
it has become a federation that seeks to solidify and promote certain systems and values : democracy , human rights , protection of minorities , and a dialogue between cultures and religions .
and it seeks to do this far beyond the geographic borders of europe . this is exactly why a decision for or against turkish accession to the european union is such an important test of whether europeans are serious about having more decision-making power - and greater influence - on the world stage . test case in other words , turkey is a test case for whether germany and the european union can really take on a role of " global player . "
but politicians and countries that call for a popular " yes / no " referendum on the matter of turkish accession -lrb- such as french president jacques chirac -rrb- seem to lack the necessary maturity to take on such a role . even more primitive is the idea of the christian democrats in germany to start a petition drive . the suggestion has , rightly , met with loud opposition in germany ; in the current government and within the ruling parties , but also within the union .
thus , acting union floor leader wolfgang bosbach speaks of " misunderstandings " and a " queasy feeling " in the face of his party leader 's newest idea . jumping the gun never mind that bosbach himself is opposed to turkish entry into the european union , because he fears turkish accession will lead to more terror inside europe .
this fear is in itself baseless , since the blasphemy of terrorism is not bound by religion or culture , and kills irrespective of a person 's political or religious beliefs . the question remains : is such a polarization necessary just now ?
because up to now , it has n't even been definitively decided whether to being accession talks , let alone allow turkey imminent eu entry . it will be at least 15 years before this question needs to be addressed - if it ever needs to be addressed .
in other words , there is plenty of time for a political and societal discussion on the basis of fact .
the only sure thing now is : there are plenty of good reasons to be in favor of accession , and also several understandable fears that speak against turkey 's entry into the eu . the union suggestion paves the way to a spiral of opposing positions that could lead to excesses that would harm germany 's carefully-groomed image of being an enlightened , humanitarian , and tolerant democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right-wing fire attack on a home inhabited by turks in may 1993 in solingen killed five people .

the discussion is a " declaration of war , " they say . populism is not diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel 's suggestion lacks even the slightest scrap of reason , instead scraping the barrel of the lowest kind of populism .
but populism can not be a guideline of political diplomacy .
it ca n't take the place of informed debate .
would anyone in germany actually want to rebuild the berlin wall - automatic firing devices and all - simply because polls show more and more people who are upset with the economic situation in the country want their wall back ? eu expansion to the east and southeast is a necessary , and thus correct , decision .
for a long time now , the eu has been more than just a group of nations seeking to improve economic conditions for its members .
it has become a federation that seeks to solidify and promote certain systems and values : democracy , human rights , protection of minorities , and a dialogue between cultures and religions .
and it seeks to do this far beyond the geographic borders of europe . this is exactly why a decision for or against turkish accession to the european union is such an important test of whether europeans are serious about having more decision-making power - and greater influence - on the world stage . test case in other words , turkey is a test case for whether germany and the european union can really take on a role of " global player . "
but politicians and countries that call for a popular " yes / no " referendum on the matter of turkish accession -lrb- such as french president jacques chirac -rrb- seem to lack the necessary maturity to take on such a role . even more primitive is the idea of the christian democrats in germany to start a petition drive . the suggestion has , rightly , met with loud opposition in germany ; in the current government and within the ruling parties , but also within the union .

the vehicles no longer suit the military 's new concept of being able to quickly respond to crisis situations abroad . five years ago , the proposal to sell the tanks to turkey already provoked one of the worst conflicts within germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens . at the time , the then parliamentary leader of the greens , kerstin müller , voiced her party 's concerns . " we think this is the wrong decision , " she said .
the greens ' resistance eventually blocked the sale of 1,000 leopard 2 tanks for about € 7 billion -lrb- $ 8.6 billion -rrb- . now , the junior coalition partner is once again raising questions about a possible deal with turkey . " the european commission recommends negotiations -lrb- with turkey -rrb- and germany starts talking about tanks , " said claudia roth , the party 's new co-chair , adding that the discussion left a bad taste in her mouth . no automatic approval roth added that she was n't necessarily opposed to a sale . but " there 's no blank check for a single country in the world - no eu country , no nato country , " she said , adding that the commission 's recommendation on turkey did not automatically justify an arms sale . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : claudia roth " every single application has to be examined and then people will have to make a decision , " roth -lrb- photo -rrb- said . germany had previously rejected arms sales to turkey because of concerns about the oppression of the country 's kurdish minority .

german car maker opel , the loss-making subsidiary of general motors , is to axe 6,000-7,000 jobs from a total german workforce of around 12,000 , according to news reports . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- plans to axe a total 12,000 jobs in europe , or nearly one in five of its 62,000-strong european workforce , with germany to bear the brunt of the cuts , the financial times reported quoting gm sources . the job cuts are to be announced on thursday when gm unveils its plans to restructure its loss-making european activities , which alongside opel include saab in sweden and vauxhall in britain , the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported separately . the german paper also put the number of jobs on the line at 6,000-7,000 . gm 's european brands have lost more than € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- over the last four years , including several hundred million euros this year , according to the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung . two of gm 's biggest european factories - opel 's rüsselheim plant in the central german state of hesse and saab 's trollhättan site in sweden - were under threat of closure , according to the financial times . gm executives have been growing increasingly frustrated at regulatory and labor restrictions in europe .

" western europe , and germany in particular , has become a very expensive place to do business , " he said . government gets involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement german government officials said they are already involved in talks about the crisis .
economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said federal , state and local officials were trying to help preserve jobs at the plant in rüsselsheim as well as another one in bochum in the western state of north rhine-westphalia . but clement added that company and employee representatives first had to work on reaching a solution .
north rhine-westphalian economics minister harald schartau said the state government could help with bureaucratic issues but not with money . union leaders said they realized employers had much more power in the matter . " they can threaten to cut jobs and close plants , " hartwig oertel , a spokesman for the metalworkers ' union ig metall in frankfurt told reporters , according to reuters news service . that 's why workers had to use a different strategy , focusing on the damage to the company 's image and brand loyalty a plant closure would have .
he added that highly qualified workers in germany were another reason for opel to stay there .
while equally concerned about job security in bochum , that plant 's workers ' council leader said he did n't expect layoffs to happen until 2006 .
" we have job security contracts with management , " ditmar hahn told süddeutsche zeitung , adding that company officials were already preparing a polish plant to take over production of opel 's astra line . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm savings to hit opel american car manufacturer general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- intends to save more than € 500 million -lrb- $ 619 million -rrb- on its operations in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 europe remains skeptical of china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-chinese business ties are not enough to convince all of the eu while a flurry of eu delegations pay tribute to beijing 's growing economic prowess , many still harbor reservations about china 's human rights record as evidenced by brussels ' recent decision to continue the arms embargo . berlin and paris have been vying to strengthen their economic interests in china over the last several days .
ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , and eu commission president romano prodi during a conference at the eu commission may 6 , 2004 .
france and germany are certainly not alone in improving business ties with the asian powerhouse .
in the past year , the european union has focused on increasing trade and investment in china .
as a bloc , the eu surpassed the united states in direct foreign investment in china for the first time in 2003 .
and the interest seems to be mutual , with the chinese foreign ministry dubbing a new trade policy initiative " the year of europe . "
according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .
more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "
" president chirac 's remarks conveniently ignore china 's obligations under international human rights law , " the activist group said in a statement monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese paramilitary police march onto beijing 's tiananmen square to perform the flag raising ceremony on june 4 , 2004 , the 15th anniversary of the military crackdown on democracy protesters .
" crimes against humanity such as those committed by the nazis in world war ii , under apartheid in south africa and during the genocide in rwanda , are not diminished or erased by the mere passage of years or even decades , " said the group , which is also lobbying the eu to keep a weapons embargo in place .
continued ban on arms trade the weapons ban , which was imposed after the tiananmen square massacre 15 years ago , has been a subject of much debate between brussels and beijing , with french president chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder endorsing its removal .
although the bloc 's foreign ministers on monday agreed to keep the embargo in place , the eu 's dutch presidency said it may be heading towards a revision of that decision in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinesische soldiers on parade " we hope to be able to indicate a positive orientation towards lifting , " dutch foreign minister bernanrd told reporters after a meeting in luxembourg .
he said the 25-member bloc was studying in particular how to strengthen a self-imposed eu code of conduct on weapons sales , to ensure that arms were not sold for dubious purposes if the embargo were lifted .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who is in favor of removing the ban , said on monday china had demonstrated it was on the road to improving its human rights records .
it was now up to the eu , to the european parliament and to the council of ministers to determine whether the improvements justified lifting the embargo .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country has been one of the most reluctant to remove the ban , said earlier monday that the eu could consider lifting the arms embargo only in a " proper and sensible way .

akin birdal escaped the assassination attempt , but the event 's horrifying legacy remains . " we decided to keep this door , as a sort of bad memory , " öndül told dw-world . see-saw battle that 's not to say all recent memories have been good .
since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül . " in the last five years , the operations against us are not physical , but are done through the law , " said öndül . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kemal atatürk bridge in istanbul the words are unwelcome in the halls of turkish government buildings nowadays .
in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .
the death penalty has been eliminated , rights given to turkey 's large kurdish minority and laws passed that aim to stop systematic torture in turkish prisons .
the steps are among the reasons the eu 's executive body last week recommended the european union take up membership negotiations with turkey in the near future . now it 's up to european leaders to give final approval when they meet in december . just a little " ill treatment " the country 's chances are good .
what prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has achieved through his akp party 's absolute parliamentary majority , has taken the country light years ahead , say western diplomats and observers .
" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .
in a recent interview with a group of journalists , erdogan reacted testily to a question that suggested torture was still widespread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister recep tayyip erdogan " if you want to see what is happening please be my guest and come to turkey and investigate for yourself , " erdogan said , echoing a speech he gave before the european parliament .
" because a claim is not enough on this position .
the claim has to be proven . " numbers say torture still widespread öndül is happy to do so .
according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .
" democratization in turkey is unavoidable , " said öndül , before ushering a few reporters out of his office .
" and it will continue , whether the eu opens negotiations or not .

in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .

" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .

" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .
1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .
some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .

instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .

" a kind of kick-start would be required " to break the deadlock and lead to a resumption in negotiations at an oct .
20 meeting scheduled in lisbon with foreign ministers of the four mercosur countries , lamy said at a brussels news conference on tuesday .
the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .
31 as a deadline for completing the negotiations .
the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "

16 , a day after the killings , journalists could move freely among the bodies and disturbed the scene . " some colleagues rearranged the bodies in order to photograph them better ...
from a forensic point of view we were actually destroying evidence , " he said . milosevic stands accused of over 60 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the war in croatia 1991-95 , the 1992-95 bosnian war and the 1998-99 kosovo conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identified bodies of 335 victims of the srebrenica massacre were buried in july 2004 for the bloody war in bosnia , which left over 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the most serious of war crimes . if convicted , milosevic could be sentenced to life in prison . milosevic rejects defense lawyers in court on tuesday milosevic again clashed with the judges over the defence lawyers the court forced upon him because of his bad health . he poured scorn on kay 's questioning of the witness , labelling it " one further example that you ought to give me back my right to defend myself . " the former president refused the opportunity the judges gave him to ask questions of the witness himself . " i do n't wish to use scraps of a right that you took away in the first place , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic entering the courtroom during a previous session an appeal has been lodged with the appeals chamber of the un court to overturn the court 's decision to appoint defence counsel but it is unclear when they will hand down their ruling . since a lawyer was forced on him milosevic has asked the judges to reinstate his right to present his own defence on every day he has come to court so far . the trial will continue wednesday with the prosecution cross-examination of hutsch . first hearing for srebrenica genocide suspect the bosnian serb army 's former security chief , facing genocide charges for his alleged role in coordinating the 1995 srebrenica massacre , meanwhile called on his " comrades in arms " to turn themselves in during his first appearance before the un war crimes court on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beara in court on tuesday lubisja beara , 65 -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was transferred to the hague on sunday , did not enter a plea to the genocide charges against him but instead called on all remaining fugitives to turn themselves in . " all of those who would see this , my comrades in arms , i call on them to voluntarily surrender to get rid of the stone that hangs around the neck of our nation , " beara said . he did not specifically name bosnian serb military leader ratko mladic , who has been on the run for the past nine years since he was charged with genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes during the 1992-95 bosnian war . mladic was beara 's direct superior at the time of the srebrenica massacre , the only episode in the bloody break-up of yugoslavia in the 1990s that the un court has recognized as constituting a genocide . beara faces charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegedly coordinating different sections of the army to facilitate the slaughter .
if convicted , he could be sentenced to life in prison . on tuesday , beara asked for a 30-day delay to consider his plea .
he is now expected to enter a plea on nov .

" the major obstacle is the cooperation with the -lrb- tribunal -rrb- because we have every interest to move forward together , " fischer said after talks with draskovic . fischer also urged draskovic to ensure the republics of serbia and montenegro remained in the loose union that has bound them since the federal republic of yugoslavia was formally disbanded last year .

" a kind of kick-start would be required " to break the deadlock and lead to a resumption in negotiations at an oct .
20 meeting scheduled in lisbon with foreign ministers of the four mercosur countries , lamy said at a brussels news conference on tuesday .
the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .
31 as a deadline for completing the negotiations .
the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .
time pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade pascal lamy kick-starting the trade talks takes on new urgency as pascal lamy 's mandate ends oct .
31 .
if no deal is reached by then , the south american bloc would have to negotiate with a new eu trade delegation , which is likely to delay a final agreement .
lamy , who will be succeeded as trade commissioner by briton peter mandelson on nov .
1 , reiterated his hope that an accord could be reached before his last day in office .
" i always said that i would be sorry if there were no accord before oct .
31 , " he said , but added , " substance takes precedence over the calendar . "
once established , the transatlantic trade accord will encompass a population of more than 650 million people .
reaching a deal with the eu is seen as a crucial component for the south american economic bloc to strengthen its bargaining position with the united states in negotiations for the free trade area of the americas which were originally scheduled to begin on jan .

16 , a day after the killings , journalists could move freely among the bodies and disturbed the scene . " some colleagues rearranged the bodies in order to photograph them better ...
from a forensic point of view we were actually destroying evidence , " he said . milosevic stands accused of over 60 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the war in croatia 1991-95 , the 1992-95 bosnian war and the 1998-99 kosovo conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identified bodies of 335 victims of the srebrenica massacre were buried in july 2004 for the bloody war in bosnia , which left over 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the most serious of war crimes . if convicted , milosevic could be sentenced to life in prison . milosevic rejects defense lawyers in court on tuesday milosevic again clashed with the judges over the defence lawyers the court forced upon him because of his bad health . he poured scorn on kay 's questioning of the witness , labelling it " one further example that you ought to give me back my right to defend myself . " the former president refused the opportunity the judges gave him to ask questions of the witness himself . " i do n't wish to use scraps of a right that you took away in the first place , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic entering the courtroom during a previous session an appeal has been lodged with the appeals chamber of the un court to overturn the court 's decision to appoint defence counsel but it is unclear when they will hand down their ruling . since a lawyer was forced on him milosevic has asked the judges to reinstate his right to present his own defence on every day he has come to court so far . the trial will continue wednesday with the prosecution cross-examination of hutsch . first hearing for srebrenica genocide suspect the bosnian serb army 's former security chief , facing genocide charges for his alleged role in coordinating the 1995 srebrenica massacre , meanwhile called on his " comrades in arms " to turn themselves in during his first appearance before the un war crimes court on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beara in court on tuesday lubisja beara , 65 -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was transferred to the hague on sunday , did not enter a plea to the genocide charges against him but instead called on all remaining fugitives to turn themselves in . " all of those who would see this , my comrades in arms , i call on them to voluntarily surrender to get rid of the stone that hangs around the neck of our nation , " beara said . he did not specifically name bosnian serb military leader ratko mladic , who has been on the run for the past nine years since he was charged with genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes during the 1992-95 bosnian war . mladic was beara 's direct superior at the time of the srebrenica massacre , the only episode in the bloody break-up of yugoslavia in the 1990s that the un court has recognized as constituting a genocide . beara faces charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegedly coordinating different sections of the army to facilitate the slaughter .
if convicted , he could be sentenced to life in prison . on tuesday , beara asked for a 30-day delay to consider his plea .

" a kind of kick-start would be required " to break the deadlock and lead to a resumption in negotiations at an oct .
20 meeting scheduled in lisbon with foreign ministers of the four mercosur countries , lamy said at a brussels news conference on tuesday .
the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .
31 as a deadline for completing the negotiations .
the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .
time pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade pascal lamy kick-starting the trade talks takes on new urgency as pascal lamy 's mandate ends oct .
31 .
if no deal is reached by then , the south american bloc would have to negotiate with a new eu trade delegation , which is likely to delay a final agreement .
lamy , who will be succeeded as trade commissioner by briton peter mandelson on nov .
1 , reiterated his hope that an accord could be reached before his last day in office .
" i always said that i would be sorry if there were no accord before oct .
31 , " he said , but added , " substance takes precedence over the calendar . "
once established , the transatlantic trade accord will encompass a population of more than 650 million people .
reaching a deal with the eu is seen as a crucial component for the south american economic bloc to strengthen its bargaining position with the united states in negotiations for the free trade area of the americas which were originally scheduled to begin on jan .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

16 , a day after the killings , journalists could move freely among the bodies and disturbed the scene . " some colleagues rearranged the bodies in order to photograph them better ...
from a forensic point of view we were actually destroying evidence , " he said . milosevic stands accused of over 60 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the war in croatia 1991-95 , the 1992-95 bosnian war and the 1998-99 kosovo conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identified bodies of 335 victims of the srebrenica massacre were buried in july 2004 for the bloody war in bosnia , which left over 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the most serious of war crimes . if convicted , milosevic could be sentenced to life in prison . milosevic rejects defense lawyers in court on tuesday milosevic again clashed with the judges over the defence lawyers the court forced upon him because of his bad health . he poured scorn on kay 's questioning of the witness , labelling it " one further example that you ought to give me back my right to defend myself . " the former president refused the opportunity the judges gave him to ask questions of the witness himself . " i do n't wish to use scraps of a right that you took away in the first place , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic entering the courtroom during a previous session an appeal has been lodged with the appeals chamber of the un court to overturn the court 's decision to appoint defence counsel but it is unclear when they will hand down their ruling . since a lawyer was forced on him milosevic has asked the judges to reinstate his right to present his own defence on every day he has come to court so far . the trial will continue wednesday with the prosecution cross-examination of hutsch . first hearing for srebrenica genocide suspect the bosnian serb army 's former security chief , facing genocide charges for his alleged role in coordinating the 1995 srebrenica massacre , meanwhile called on his " comrades in arms " to turn themselves in during his first appearance before the un war crimes court on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beara in court on tuesday lubisja beara , 65 -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was transferred to the hague on sunday , did not enter a plea to the genocide charges against him but instead called on all remaining fugitives to turn themselves in . " all of those who would see this , my comrades in arms , i call on them to voluntarily surrender to get rid of the stone that hangs around the neck of our nation , " beara said . he did not specifically name bosnian serb military leader ratko mladic , who has been on the run for the past nine years since he was charged with genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes during the 1992-95 bosnian war . mladic was beara 's direct superior at the time of the srebrenica massacre , the only episode in the bloody break-up of yugoslavia in the 1990s that the un court has recognized as constituting a genocide . beara faces charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegedly coordinating different sections of the army to facilitate the slaughter .

" a kind of kick-start would be required " to break the deadlock and lead to a resumption in negotiations at an oct .
20 meeting scheduled in lisbon with foreign ministers of the four mercosur countries , lamy said at a brussels news conference on tuesday .
the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .
31 as a deadline for completing the negotiations .
the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .
1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .
some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission , neelie kroes , has also faced objection from several quarters for her past connection to big business .
although the parliamentary committee on economic and monetary affairs has noted a potential conflict of interest , it did not reject her nomination . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu commission faces intense grilling the eu parliament has begun questioning incoming eu commissioners , largely to sniff out potential conflicts of interests of a few wealthy members .

critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .

ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .

according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .
more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "

since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül .

" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .

according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .

since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .

more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .

some of the country 's human rights activists beg to differ . on the door leading into hünsü öndül 's office there are seven bullet holes , each circled in black marker .
inside the office of the president of the turkish human rights association there are two more on the bookcase , and another in a chair . the murder attempt by a paramilitary group took place in 1998 , when his predecessor sat behind the simple wooden desk .
akin birdal escaped the assassination attempt , but the event 's horrifying legacy remains . " we decided to keep this door , as a sort of bad memory , " öndül told dw-world . see-saw battle that 's not to say all recent memories have been good .
since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül . " in the last five years , the operations against us are not physical , but are done through the law , " said öndül . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kemal atatürk bridge in istanbul the words are unwelcome in the halls of turkish government buildings nowadays .
in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .
the death penalty has been eliminated , rights given to turkey 's large kurdish minority and laws passed that aim to stop systematic torture in turkish prisons .
the steps are among the reasons the eu 's executive body last week recommended the european union take up membership negotiations with turkey in the near future . now it 's up to european leaders to give final approval when they meet in december . just a little " ill treatment " the country 's chances are good .
what prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has achieved through his akp party 's absolute parliamentary majority , has taken the country light years ahead , say western diplomats and observers .
" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .
in a recent interview with a group of journalists , erdogan reacted testily to a question that suggested torture was still widespread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister recep tayyip erdogan " if you want to see what is happening please be my guest and come to turkey and investigate for yourself , " erdogan said , echoing a speech he gave before the european parliament .
" because a claim is not enough on this position .
the claim has to be proven . " numbers say torture still widespread öndül is happy to do so .
according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .
" democratization in turkey is unavoidable , " said öndül , before ushering a few reporters out of his office .
" and it will continue , whether the eu opens negotiations or not . " andreas tzortzis , reporting from ankara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey wants accession talks in 2005 turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan said wednesday he hopes accession talks with the european union begin next year .

thus , acting union floor leader wolfgang bosbach speaks of " misunderstandings " and a " queasy feeling " in the face of his party leader 's newest idea . jumping the gun never mind that bosbach himself is opposed to turkish entry into the european union , because he fears turkish accession will lead to more terror inside europe .
this fear is in itself baseless , since the blasphemy of terrorism is not bound by religion or culture , and kills irrespective of a person 's political or religious beliefs . the question remains : is such a polarization necessary just now ?
because up to now , it has n't even been definitively decided whether to being accession talks , let alone allow turkey imminent eu entry . it will be at least 15 years before this question needs to be addressed - if it ever needs to be addressed .
in other words , there is plenty of time for a political and societal discussion on the basis of fact .
the only sure thing now is : there are plenty of good reasons to be in favor of accession , and also several understandable fears that speak against turkey 's entry into the eu . the union suggestion paves the way to a spiral of opposing positions that could lead to excesses that would harm germany 's carefully-groomed image of being an enlightened , humanitarian , and tolerant democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right-wing fire attack on a home inhabited by turks in may 1993 in solingen killed five people .

the discussion is a " declaration of war , " they say . populism is not diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel 's suggestion lacks even the slightest scrap of reason , instead scraping the barrel of the lowest kind of populism .
but populism can not be a guideline of political diplomacy .
it ca n't take the place of informed debate .
would anyone in germany actually want to rebuild the berlin wall - automatic firing devices and all - simply because polls show more and more people who are upset with the economic situation in the country want their wall back ? eu expansion to the east and southeast is a necessary , and thus correct , decision .
for a long time now , the eu has been more than just a group of nations seeking to improve economic conditions for its members .
it has become a federation that seeks to solidify and promote certain systems and values : democracy , human rights , protection of minorities , and a dialogue between cultures and religions .
and it seeks to do this far beyond the geographic borders of europe . this is exactly why a decision for or against turkish accession to the european union is such an important test of whether europeans are serious about having more decision-making power - and greater influence - on the world stage . test case in other words , turkey is a test case for whether germany and the european union can really take on a role of " global player . "
but politicians and countries that call for a popular " yes / no " referendum on the matter of turkish accession -lrb- such as french president jacques chirac -rrb- seem to lack the necessary maturity to take on such a role . even more primitive is the idea of the christian democrats in germany to start a petition drive . the suggestion has , rightly , met with loud opposition in germany ; in the current government and within the ruling parties , but also within the union .
thus , acting union floor leader wolfgang bosbach speaks of " misunderstandings " and a " queasy feeling " in the face of his party leader 's newest idea . jumping the gun never mind that bosbach himself is opposed to turkish entry into the european union , because he fears turkish accession will lead to more terror inside europe .
this fear is in itself baseless , since the blasphemy of terrorism is not bound by religion or culture , and kills irrespective of a person 's political or religious beliefs . the question remains : is such a polarization necessary just now ?
because up to now , it has n't even been definitively decided whether to being accession talks , let alone allow turkey imminent eu entry . it will be at least 15 years before this question needs to be addressed - if it ever needs to be addressed .
in other words , there is plenty of time for a political and societal discussion on the basis of fact .
the only sure thing now is : there are plenty of good reasons to be in favor of accession , and also several understandable fears that speak against turkey 's entry into the eu . the union suggestion paves the way to a spiral of opposing positions that could lead to excesses that would harm germany 's carefully-groomed image of being an enlightened , humanitarian , and tolerant democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right-wing fire attack on a home inhabited by turks in may 1993 in solingen killed five people .
there is the danger that populism aimed at lampooning a people , its culture and religion , could have incalculable results : unruly masses shouting " turks get out " in germany 's streets ; boycotts of turkish stores , and perhaps even physical attacks on turks -lrb- throwing stones , torching shops and apartments . -rrb-

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .

the paintings and drawings by august macke belong to the art museum .
the exhibit takes place concurrently with the international beethovenfest in bonn , which this year focuses on czech music .
a varied connection between the work of kupka , who has referred to himself as a " color symphonist " , and the music of dvorák and other czech composers will be made .
the rhythm of colors : frantisek kupka and august macke will be on view through nov .

" a kind of kick-start would be required " to break the deadlock and lead to a resumption in negotiations at an oct .
20 meeting scheduled in lisbon with foreign ministers of the four mercosur countries , lamy said at a brussels news conference on tuesday .
the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .
31 as a deadline for completing the negotiations .
the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .

some of the country 's human rights activists beg to differ . on the door leading into hünsü öndül 's office there are seven bullet holes , each circled in black marker .
inside the office of the president of the turkish human rights association there are two more on the bookcase , and another in a chair . the murder attempt by a paramilitary group took place in 1998 , when his predecessor sat behind the simple wooden desk .
akin birdal escaped the assassination attempt , but the event 's horrifying legacy remains . " we decided to keep this door , as a sort of bad memory , " öndül told dw-world . see-saw battle that 's not to say all recent memories have been good .
since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül . " in the last five years , the operations against us are not physical , but are done through the law , " said öndül . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kemal atatürk bridge in istanbul the words are unwelcome in the halls of turkish government buildings nowadays .
in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .
the death penalty has been eliminated , rights given to turkey 's large kurdish minority and laws passed that aim to stop systematic torture in turkish prisons .
the steps are among the reasons the eu 's executive body last week recommended the european union take up membership negotiations with turkey in the near future . now it 's up to european leaders to give final approval when they meet in december . just a little " ill treatment " the country 's chances are good .
what prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has achieved through his akp party 's absolute parliamentary majority , has taken the country light years ahead , say western diplomats and observers .
" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .
in a recent interview with a group of journalists , erdogan reacted testily to a question that suggested torture was still widespread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister recep tayyip erdogan " if you want to see what is happening please be my guest and come to turkey and investigate for yourself , " erdogan said , echoing a speech he gave before the european parliament .
" because a claim is not enough on this position .
the claim has to be proven . " numbers say torture still widespread öndül is happy to do so .
according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .
" democratization in turkey is unavoidable , " said öndül , before ushering a few reporters out of his office .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

16 , a day after the killings , journalists could move freely among the bodies and disturbed the scene . " some colleagues rearranged the bodies in order to photograph them better ...
from a forensic point of view we were actually destroying evidence , " he said . milosevic stands accused of over 60 charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his role in the war in croatia 1991-95 , the 1992-95 bosnian war and the 1998-99 kosovo conflict . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : identified bodies of 335 victims of the srebrenica massacre were buried in july 2004 for the bloody war in bosnia , which left over 200,000 people dead , he faces separate charges of genocide , the most serious of war crimes . if convicted , milosevic could be sentenced to life in prison . milosevic rejects defense lawyers in court on tuesday milosevic again clashed with the judges over the defence lawyers the court forced upon him because of his bad health . he poured scorn on kay 's questioning of the witness , labelling it " one further example that you ought to give me back my right to defend myself . " the former president refused the opportunity the judges gave him to ask questions of the witness himself . " i do n't wish to use scraps of a right that you took away in the first place , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slobodan milosevic entering the courtroom during a previous session an appeal has been lodged with the appeals chamber of the un court to overturn the court 's decision to appoint defence counsel but it is unclear when they will hand down their ruling . since a lawyer was forced on him milosevic has asked the judges to reinstate his right to present his own defence on every day he has come to court so far . the trial will continue wednesday with the prosecution cross-examination of hutsch . first hearing for srebrenica genocide suspect the bosnian serb army 's former security chief , facing genocide charges for his alleged role in coordinating the 1995 srebrenica massacre , meanwhile called on his " comrades in arms " to turn themselves in during his first appearance before the un war crimes court on tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beara in court on tuesday lubisja beara , 65 -lrb- photo -rrb- , who was transferred to the hague on sunday , did not enter a plea to the genocide charges against him but instead called on all remaining fugitives to turn themselves in . " all of those who would see this , my comrades in arms , i call on them to voluntarily surrender to get rid of the stone that hangs around the neck of our nation , " beara said . he did not specifically name bosnian serb military leader ratko mladic , who has been on the run for the past nine years since he was charged with genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes during the 1992-95 bosnian war . mladic was beara 's direct superior at the time of the srebrenica massacre , the only episode in the bloody break-up of yugoslavia in the 1990s that the un court has recognized as constituting a genocide . beara faces charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity for allegedly coordinating different sections of the army to facilitate the slaughter .
if convicted , he could be sentenced to life in prison . on tuesday , beara asked for a 30-day delay to consider his plea .
he is now expected to enter a plea on nov .

16 , a day after the killings , journalists could move freely among the bodies and disturbed the scene . " some colleagues rearranged the bodies in order to photograph them better ...

ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .

a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .

in the past year , the european union has focused on increasing trade and investment in china .
as a bloc , the eu surpassed the united states in direct foreign investment in china for the first time in 2003 .
and the interest seems to be mutual , with the chinese foreign ministry dubbing a new trade policy initiative " the year of europe . "
according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .
more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "
" president chirac 's remarks conveniently ignore china 's obligations under international human rights law , " the activist group said in a statement monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese paramilitary police march onto beijing 's tiananmen square to perform the flag raising ceremony on june 4 , 2004 , the 15th anniversary of the military crackdown on democracy protesters .
" crimes against humanity such as those committed by the nazis in world war ii , under apartheid in south africa and during the genocide in rwanda , are not diminished or erased by the mere passage of years or even decades , " said the group , which is also lobbying the eu to keep a weapons embargo in place .
continued ban on arms trade the weapons ban , which was imposed after the tiananmen square massacre 15 years ago , has been a subject of much debate between brussels and beijing , with french president chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder endorsing its removal .
although the bloc 's foreign ministers on monday agreed to keep the embargo in place , the eu 's dutch presidency said it may be heading towards a revision of that decision in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinesische soldiers on parade " we hope to be able to indicate a positive orientation towards lifting , " dutch foreign minister bernanrd told reporters after a meeting in luxembourg .
he said the 25-member bloc was studying in particular how to strengthen a self-imposed eu code of conduct on weapons sales , to ensure that arms were not sold for dubious purposes if the embargo were lifted .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who is in favor of removing the ban , said on monday china had demonstrated it was on the road to improving its human rights records .
it was now up to the eu , to the european parliament and to the council of ministers to determine whether the improvements justified lifting the embargo .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country has been one of the most reluctant to remove the ban , said earlier monday that the eu could consider lifting the arms embargo only in a " proper and sensible way .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .

some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .

some of the country 's human rights activists beg to differ . on the door leading into hünsü öndül 's office there are seven bullet holes , each circled in black marker .
inside the office of the president of the turkish human rights association there are two more on the bookcase , and another in a chair . the murder attempt by a paramilitary group took place in 1998 , when his predecessor sat behind the simple wooden desk .
akin birdal escaped the assassination attempt , but the event 's horrifying legacy remains . " we decided to keep this door , as a sort of bad memory , " öndül told dw-world . see-saw battle that 's not to say all recent memories have been good .
since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül . " in the last five years , the operations against us are not physical , but are done through the law , " said öndül . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kemal atatürk bridge in istanbul the words are unwelcome in the halls of turkish government buildings nowadays .
in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .
the death penalty has been eliminated , rights given to turkey 's large kurdish minority and laws passed that aim to stop systematic torture in turkish prisons .
the steps are among the reasons the eu 's executive body last week recommended the european union take up membership negotiations with turkey in the near future . now it 's up to european leaders to give final approval when they meet in december . just a little " ill treatment " the country 's chances are good .
what prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has achieved through his akp party 's absolute parliamentary majority , has taken the country light years ahead , say western diplomats and observers .
" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .
in a recent interview with a group of journalists , erdogan reacted testily to a question that suggested torture was still widespread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister recep tayyip erdogan " if you want to see what is happening please be my guest and come to turkey and investigate for yourself , " erdogan said , echoing a speech he gave before the european parliament .
" because a claim is not enough on this position .
the claim has to be proven . " numbers say torture still widespread öndül is happy to do so .
according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .

the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .
31 as a deadline for completing the negotiations .
the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "

with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .

critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .

although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .

" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .

" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .
1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .
some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission , neelie kroes , has also faced objection from several quarters for her past connection to big business .

" a kind of kick-start would be required " to break the deadlock and lead to a resumption in negotiations at an oct .
20 meeting scheduled in lisbon with foreign ministers of the four mercosur countries , lamy said at a brussels news conference on tuesday .
the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .
31 as a deadline for completing the negotiations .
the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .
time pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade pascal lamy kick-starting the trade talks takes on new urgency as pascal lamy 's mandate ends oct .
31 .
if no deal is reached by then , the south american bloc would have to negotiate with a new eu trade delegation , which is likely to delay a final agreement .
lamy , who will be succeeded as trade commissioner by briton peter mandelson on nov .
1 , reiterated his hope that an accord could be reached before his last day in office .
" i always said that i would be sorry if there were no accord before oct .
31 , " he said , but added , " substance takes precedence over the calendar . "
once established , the transatlantic trade accord will encompass a population of more than 650 million people .
reaching a deal with the eu is seen as a crucial component for the south american economic bloc to strengthen its bargaining position with the united states in negotiations for the free trade area of the americas which were originally scheduled to begin on jan .

" a kind of kick-start would be required " to break the deadlock and lead to a resumption in negotiations at an oct .
20 meeting scheduled in lisbon with foreign ministers of the four mercosur countries , lamy said at a brussels news conference on tuesday .
the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .
31 as a deadline for completing the negotiations .
the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .
time pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union commissioner for trade pascal lamy kick-starting the trade talks takes on new urgency as pascal lamy 's mandate ends oct .
31 .
if no deal is reached by then , the south american bloc would have to negotiate with a new eu trade delegation , which is likely to delay a final agreement .
lamy , who will be succeeded as trade commissioner by briton peter mandelson on nov .
1 , reiterated his hope that an accord could be reached before his last day in office .
" i always said that i would be sorry if there were no accord before oct .
31 , " he said , but added , " substance takes precedence over the calendar . "
once established , the transatlantic trade accord will encompass a population of more than 650 million people .
reaching a deal with the eu is seen as a crucial component for the south american economic bloc to strengthen its bargaining position with the united states in negotiations for the free trade area of the americas which were originally scheduled to begin on jan .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

the discussion is a " declaration of war , " they say . populism is not diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel merkel 's suggestion lacks even the slightest scrap of reason , instead scraping the barrel of the lowest kind of populism .
but populism can not be a guideline of political diplomacy .
it ca n't take the place of informed debate .
would anyone in germany actually want to rebuild the berlin wall - automatic firing devices and all - simply because polls show more and more people who are upset with the economic situation in the country want their wall back ? eu expansion to the east and southeast is a necessary , and thus correct , decision .
for a long time now , the eu has been more than just a group of nations seeking to improve economic conditions for its members .
it has become a federation that seeks to solidify and promote certain systems and values : democracy , human rights , protection of minorities , and a dialogue between cultures and religions .
and it seeks to do this far beyond the geographic borders of europe . this is exactly why a decision for or against turkish accession to the european union is such an important test of whether europeans are serious about having more decision-making power - and greater influence - on the world stage . test case in other words , turkey is a test case for whether germany and the european union can really take on a role of " global player . "
but politicians and countries that call for a popular " yes / no " referendum on the matter of turkish accession -lrb- such as french president jacques chirac -rrb- seem to lack the necessary maturity to take on such a role . even more primitive is the idea of the christian democrats in germany to start a petition drive . the suggestion has , rightly , met with loud opposition in germany ; in the current government and within the ruling parties , but also within the union .
thus , acting union floor leader wolfgang bosbach speaks of " misunderstandings " and a " queasy feeling " in the face of his party leader 's newest idea . jumping the gun never mind that bosbach himself is opposed to turkish entry into the european union , because he fears turkish accession will lead to more terror inside europe .
this fear is in itself baseless , since the blasphemy of terrorism is not bound by religion or culture , and kills irrespective of a person 's political or religious beliefs . the question remains : is such a polarization necessary just now ?
because up to now , it has n't even been definitively decided whether to being accession talks , let alone allow turkey imminent eu entry . it will be at least 15 years before this question needs to be addressed - if it ever needs to be addressed .
in other words , there is plenty of time for a political and societal discussion on the basis of fact .
the only sure thing now is : there are plenty of good reasons to be in favor of accession , and also several understandable fears that speak against turkey 's entry into the eu . the union suggestion paves the way to a spiral of opposing positions that could lead to excesses that would harm germany 's carefully-groomed image of being an enlightened , humanitarian , and tolerant democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a right-wing fire attack on a home inhabited by turks in may 1993 in solingen killed five people .
there is the danger that populism aimed at lampooning a people , its culture and religion , could have incalculable results : unruly masses shouting " turks get out " in germany 's streets ; boycotts of turkish stores , and perhaps even physical attacks on turks -lrb- throwing stones , torching shops and apartments . -rrb-

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.10.2004 europe remains skeptical of china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french-chinese business ties are not enough to convince all of the eu while a flurry of eu delegations pay tribute to beijing 's growing economic prowess , many still harbor reservations about china 's human rights record as evidenced by brussels ' recent decision to continue the arms embargo . berlin and paris have been vying to strengthen their economic interests in china over the last several days .
ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , and eu commission president romano prodi during a conference at the eu commission may 6 , 2004 .
france and germany are certainly not alone in improving business ties with the asian powerhouse .
in the past year , the european union has focused on increasing trade and investment in china .
as a bloc , the eu surpassed the united states in direct foreign investment in china for the first time in 2003 .
and the interest seems to be mutual , with the chinese foreign ministry dubbing a new trade policy initiative " the year of europe . "
according to the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , european efforts to gain more access to the chinese market have paid off .
whereas french-based companies are on course to invest an additional $ 554 million in 2004 , britain is aiming for an increase of $ 770 million , while the netherlands and germany each plan to invest $ 1.1 billion more in china .
more than business at stake the increased interest in business , however , has not gone unnoticed by human rights groups , who worry that europe 's new-found infatuation with chinese investment opportunities may blind them to beijing 's poor human rights record .
a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .
instead , the french president focused on praising economic developments and reiterated his opposition to the eu arms embargo as an outdated product " of another time which does not correspond any more to the reality of the situation . "
" president chirac 's remarks conveniently ignore china 's obligations under international human rights law , " the activist group said in a statement monday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese paramilitary police march onto beijing 's tiananmen square to perform the flag raising ceremony on june 4 , 2004 , the 15th anniversary of the military crackdown on democracy protesters .
" crimes against humanity such as those committed by the nazis in world war ii , under apartheid in south africa and during the genocide in rwanda , are not diminished or erased by the mere passage of years or even decades , " said the group , which is also lobbying the eu to keep a weapons embargo in place .
continued ban on arms trade the weapons ban , which was imposed after the tiananmen square massacre 15 years ago , has been a subject of much debate between brussels and beijing , with french president chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder endorsing its removal .
although the bloc 's foreign ministers on monday agreed to keep the embargo in place , the eu 's dutch presidency said it may be heading towards a revision of that decision in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinesische soldiers on parade " we hope to be able to indicate a positive orientation towards lifting , " dutch foreign minister bernanrd told reporters after a meeting in luxembourg .
he said the 25-member bloc was studying in particular how to strengthen a self-imposed eu code of conduct on weapons sales , to ensure that arms were not sold for dubious purposes if the embargo were lifted .
german foreign minister joschka fischer , who is in favor of removing the ban , said on monday china had demonstrated it was on the road to improving its human rights records .
it was now up to the eu , to the european parliament and to the council of ministers to determine whether the improvements justified lifting the embargo .
british foreign secretary jack straw , whose country has been one of the most reluctant to remove the ban , said earlier monday that the eu could consider lifting the arms embargo only in a " proper and sensible way .

ahead of his four-day tour of china this week , french president jacques chirac secured some 20 contracts worth over $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.2 billion -rrb- in deals between french and chinese companies .
on monday , german finance minister hans eichel , whose country already tops the list of china 's biggest trade partners with a volume of more than $ 42 billion in 2003 , offered to increase its involvement in china 's economy by providing german " know-how " for the privatization and regulation of china 's growing financial and banking sector .

a beijing-based lobby group , human rights in china , criticized chirac for failing to bring up human rights abuses during his high-profile meetings with chinese leaders over the weekend .

german car maker opel , the loss-making subsidiary of general motors , is to axe 6,000-7,000 jobs from a total german workforce of around 12,000 , according to news reports . general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- plans to axe a total 12,000 jobs in europe , or nearly one in five of its 62,000-strong european workforce , with germany to bear the brunt of the cuts , the financial times reported quoting gm sources . the job cuts are to be announced on thursday when gm unveils its plans to restructure its loss-making european activities , which alongside opel include saab in sweden and vauxhall in britain , the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung reported separately . the german paper also put the number of jobs on the line at 6,000-7,000 . gm 's european brands have lost more than € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- over the last four years , including several hundred million euros this year , according to the german newspaper süddeutsche zeitung . two of gm 's biggest european factories - opel 's rüsselheim plant in the central german state of hesse and saab 's trollhättan site in sweden - were under threat of closure , according to the financial times . gm executives have been growing increasingly frustrated at regulatory and labor restrictions in europe .

" western europe , and germany in particular , has become a very expensive place to do business , " he said . government gets involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement german government officials said they are already involved in talks about the crisis .
economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- said federal , state and local officials were trying to help preserve jobs at the plant in rüsselsheim as well as another one in bochum in the western state of north rhine-westphalia . but clement added that company and employee representatives first had to work on reaching a solution .
north rhine-westphalian economics minister harald schartau said the state government could help with bureaucratic issues but not with money . union leaders said they realized employers had much more power in the matter . " they can threaten to cut jobs and close plants , " hartwig oertel , a spokesman for the metalworkers ' union ig metall in frankfurt told reporters , according to reuters news service . that 's why workers had to use a different strategy , focusing on the damage to the company 's image and brand loyalty a plant closure would have .

the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .

his latest work " land of plenty , " which just opened in germany , takes a critical look at post-9/11 america . wenders , the director of " wings of desire " and " million dollar hotel " , joins a growing number of filmmakers to delve into how the terrorist attacks of sept .
11 , 2001 , have affected american society .
a long-time resident of los angeles , wenders uses the city as the backdrop for a tale of paranoia and dislocation that casts an eye on the forgotten parts of america . besides looking at the climate of fear that has descended upon the united states in the past few years , " land of plenty " explores the paradox of how the world 's richest and most powerful nation can at the same time have masses of homeless people on the streets or millions without adequate health insurance .
it also attacks the country 's often insular nature and the intolerance of fundamentalist christians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film scene from wenders ' " land of plenty " " i had the hope that it would work like a shock .
this land of plenty is a vacuum inside , a land of drought and poverty : mental , spiritual , social , political poverty , " wenders told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper in a recent interview . the movie centers on the patriotic but paranoid vietnam veteran paul -lrb- john diehl -rrb- who travels through the city looking for muslim terrorists .
paul is joined by his niece lana -lrb- michelle williams -rrb- , a young and idealistic christian who after spending time helping palestinians in the middle east tries to improve the lot of los angeles ' homeless . assault on bush filmed in only 16 days with digital cameras and a budget of € 800,000 -lrb- $ 1 million -rrb- , the movie is wenders ' assault on the america of george w. bush . " the idea for ' land of plenty ' originated with the fundamentalist christianity of the bush era .
from the anger that christianity has been so perverted and used in so a perfidious manner for political interests , " wenders said .
" as a christian , i know no other option except to be against war and to have solidarity with the poor . " despite their similar dislike for president bush , the german contends he is not following the path cut by left-wing documentary maker michael moore , who had major success with his film " fahrenheit 9/11 " .
" i do n't go for polemics like michael moore .
but maybe that would work better in america , " wenders told the dpa news agency . although considered one of the better known german directors in america , wenders is unsure how the film will be received by american audiences .
he said the american members of the jury at this year 's venice film festival took the attitude that a european outsider had little business criticizing the united states in the way " land of plenty " does . thinking of leaving bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wim wenders " the americans like to listen to themselves .
arguments from outside often fall on deaf ears , " wenders said , adding he considered leaving the united states last year as the climate in the country deteriorated into one of fear and xenophobia in the run up to the war in iraq .
instead , he decided to make a film that would tackle a subject many americans would not or could not make . but even some american viewers who respect wenders as a director apparently have difficulty with how the movie 's leading characters come across . on one internet film forum , an american who recently saw " land of plenty " in paris took wenders to task for his " weakness for clichés about america rather than finding the real thing .
europeans might find the american ' types ' portrayed in this film a validation of how they view the us , but most thoughtful americans will probably be irritated by the simple reductions of the characters .

loneliness and self-observation are the main themes in his painting . his imagery reached its peak of maturity in the 30s and 40s , as a combination of , and preparation for , the important developments in american art in the 50s and 60s – abstract expressionism and pop art .
the exhibition is being organized in cooperation with the tate modern , london .
cologne is the only place other than london where this retrospective will be shown .

kupka and macke in bonn color as a key creative element , and its relationship to music played a key role for františek kupka -lrb- 1871-1957 -rrb- and august macke -lrb- 1887-1914 -rrb- , as well as for other artists of their time .
but both kupka and macke derived very different conclusions about music and color , and this exhibit - works bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " elisabeth und walterchen " by august macke from the graphics collection of the kunstmuseum bonn - shows those differences .
it includes gouaches , watercolors , and pastels from the collection of jan and meda mladek , which is housed in the museum kampa , prague .
the paintings and drawings by august macke belong to the art museum .

some of the country 's human rights activists beg to differ . on the door leading into hünsü öndül 's office there are seven bullet holes , each circled in black marker .
inside the office of the president of the turkish human rights association there are two more on the bookcase , and another in a chair . the murder attempt by a paramilitary group took place in 1998 , when his predecessor sat behind the simple wooden desk .
akin birdal escaped the assassination attempt , but the event 's horrifying legacy remains . " we decided to keep this door , as a sort of bad memory , " öndül told dw-world . see-saw battle that 's not to say all recent memories have been good .
since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül . " in the last five years , the operations against us are not physical , but are done through the law , " said öndül . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kemal atatürk bridge in istanbul the words are unwelcome in the halls of turkish government buildings nowadays .
in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .
the death penalty has been eliminated , rights given to turkey 's large kurdish minority and laws passed that aim to stop systematic torture in turkish prisons .
the steps are among the reasons the eu 's executive body last week recommended the european union take up membership negotiations with turkey in the near future . now it 's up to european leaders to give final approval when they meet in december . just a little " ill treatment " the country 's chances are good .
what prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has achieved through his akp party 's absolute parliamentary majority , has taken the country light years ahead , say western diplomats and observers .
" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .
in a recent interview with a group of journalists , erdogan reacted testily to a question that suggested torture was still widespread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister recep tayyip erdogan " if you want to see what is happening please be my guest and come to turkey and investigate for yourself , " erdogan said , echoing a speech he gave before the european parliament .
" because a claim is not enough on this position .
the claim has to be proven . " numbers say torture still widespread öndül is happy to do so .
according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .

some of the country 's human rights activists beg to differ . on the door leading into hünsü öndül 's office there are seven bullet holes , each circled in black marker .
inside the office of the president of the turkish human rights association there are two more on the bookcase , and another in a chair . the murder attempt by a paramilitary group took place in 1998 , when his predecessor sat behind the simple wooden desk .
akin birdal escaped the assassination attempt , but the event 's horrifying legacy remains . " we decided to keep this door , as a sort of bad memory , " öndül told dw-world . see-saw battle that 's not to say all recent memories have been good .
since he took over the leadership of the organization he helped found 18 years ago , the human rights lawyer has himself been roughed up by thugs .
employees working in the organization 's branch offices throughout turkey are also the subject of harassment and the organization is constantly under the legal microscope , said öndül . " in the last five years , the operations against us are not physical , but are done through the law , " said öndül . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kemal atatürk bridge in istanbul the words are unwelcome in the halls of turkish government buildings nowadays .
in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .
the death penalty has been eliminated , rights given to turkey 's large kurdish minority and laws passed that aim to stop systematic torture in turkish prisons .
the steps are among the reasons the eu 's executive body last week recommended the european union take up membership negotiations with turkey in the near future . now it 's up to european leaders to give final approval when they meet in december . just a little " ill treatment " the country 's chances are good .
what prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has achieved through his akp party 's absolute parliamentary majority , has taken the country light years ahead , say western diplomats and observers .
" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .
in a recent interview with a group of journalists , erdogan reacted testily to a question that suggested torture was still widespread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister recep tayyip erdogan " if you want to see what is happening please be my guest and come to turkey and investigate for yourself , " erdogan said , echoing a speech he gave before the european parliament .

the claim has to be proven . " numbers say torture still widespread öndül is happy to do so .
according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .
" democratization in turkey is unavoidable , " said öndül , before ushering a few reporters out of his office .

" in the last five years , the operations against us are not physical , but are done through the law , " said öndül . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kemal atatürk bridge in istanbul the words are unwelcome in the halls of turkish government buildings nowadays .
in the past three years , the country has undertaken massive , society-changing reforms as part of its single-minded drive to join the european union .
the death penalty has been eliminated , rights given to turkey 's large kurdish minority and laws passed that aim to stop systematic torture in turkish prisons .
the steps are among the reasons the eu 's executive body last week recommended the european union take up membership negotiations with turkey in the near future . now it 's up to european leaders to give final approval when they meet in december . just a little " ill treatment " the country 's chances are good .
what prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has achieved through his akp party 's absolute parliamentary majority , has taken the country light years ahead , say western diplomats and observers .
" five years ago we thought we were a democracy , " ahmet acet , the turkish foreign ministry point man for european union affairs , told a group of foreign journalists recently .
" after going through this process we realized we were less democratic than we thought . " when acet talks about human rights violations , he uses the words " ill treatment " instead of torture .
it 's a favorite term among government leaders who are especially touchy on the subject .
in a recent interview with a group of journalists , erdogan reacted testily to a question that suggested torture was still widespread .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister recep tayyip erdogan " if you want to see what is happening please be my guest and come to turkey and investigate for yourself , " erdogan said , echoing a speech he gave before the european parliament .
" because a claim is not enough on this position .
the claim has to be proven . " numbers say torture still widespread öndül is happy to do so .
according to ihd 's numbers , there were 1,391 cases of torture across 32 provinces in 2003 .
" it is important for the eu for the government to say that they do n't support torture , " said öndül , a soft-spoken man who has spent more than 20 years working in human rights .
" but that does not mean there is no torture in turkey . " officials acknowledge privately that more needs to be undertaken .
since the turkish republic 's founding in 1923 , successive governments have preached that the citizen is there to serve the state , not the other way around .
the philosophy meant that rights violations were duly ignored for the greater good of stabilizing the republic , said observers . but the eu perspective has helped change minds , said öndül .
more than promises and pledges of governments past , the prospect of actually getting into the european union , the region 's most desireable club , has been an amazing catalyst . " the progress made towards the eu has spread the idea to people that the state can be changed , " said öndül . he 's hopeful that the course will hold .
" democratization in turkey is unavoidable , " said öndül , before ushering a few reporters out of his office .
" and it will continue , whether the eu opens negotiations or not .

" a kind of kick-start would be required " to break the deadlock and lead to a resumption in negotiations at an oct .
20 meeting scheduled in lisbon with foreign ministers of the four mercosur countries , lamy said at a brussels news conference on tuesday .
the european union and mercosur members argentina , brazil , paraguay and uruguay are currently negotiating the creation of a free-trade zone between both trading blocs and have set oct .
31 as a deadline for completing the negotiations .
the lisbon meeting will " underline the strategic importance for mercosur of an agreement with the european bloc , " brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said during a meeting with his three south american colleagues over the weekend .
at the same time , he warned that the trading bloc was not willing to accept just any proposal put forth by brussels .
stalled negotiations negotiations for the free-trade zone , which began in 1999 , have come to a dead end after the two sides failed to reach an agreement on agricultural barriers and the opening up of government procurement processes .
the south americans have called the eu proposal of limiting agricultural imports " unacceptable " and " not even enough to start negotiations . "
" we might be flexible in one , two or even three points , but not in 10 , " amorim told the associated press , stressing that the group would go into the talks " with nothing to hide and offering everything we are in a condition to offer . "
chief on their list of criticisms are restrictive eu quotas for agricultural products .
with its eyes on gaining better access to the large european consumer market , the south american bloc has called for removing limits , especially for beef products , one of the region 's most important exports .
european diplomats , for their part , have complained that the latest mercosur offer for the trade accord fell short of eu expectations .
brussels has said its proposal would open a € 200 billion -lrb- $ 247 billion -rrb- public procurement market for the south american group and would immediately slash 65 percent of the tariffs on industrial goods if mercosur responded in turn by allowing more european access to the region 's investment sector , government acquisitions , telecommunications , marine shipping and banking .

if no deal is reached by then , the south american bloc would have to negotiate with a new eu trade delegation , which is likely to delay a final agreement .
lamy , who will be succeeded as trade commissioner by briton peter mandelson on nov .

once established , the transatlantic trade accord will encompass a population of more than 650 million people .

the civil liberties committee of the european parliament has rejected italy 's commissioner , rocco buttiglione , just weeks before taking office .
critics say his views on gays and women run contrary to those of the eu . italy 's nominee for the eu justice commission has caused a stir in brussels before even stepping into office .
during a close vote on monday , the civil liberties committee of the european parliament voted against rocco buttiglione after comments made in parliament last week referring to homosexuality as a " sin " and the traditional role of women in the household .
with a vote of 26 to 27 , it was the first time a parliamentary committee had ever outright rejected a nominee to the commission .
a compromise solution , put forth by the socialists , suggesting that the conservative italian politician be kept in the future commission line-up but be given a different profile was also rejected by a majority of the parliamentary panel -lrb- 28-25 -rrb- , when conservatives refused to accept changing the post .
although the vote is non-binding , many observers in rome and brussels see the panel verdict as undermining buttiglione 's credibility and that of the new commission 's center-right president jose-manuel durao barroso .
the rejection was also interpreted as a slap in the face for italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , who had proposed buttiglione .
prejudice against italy ?
" this shows the aversion felt in europe for silvio berlusconi , for a certain type of militant catholicism that is suspected of having fundamentalist leanings and for the support italy has given to the policies of us president george w. bush , " italian daily la stampa wrote of monday 's vote .
buttiglione , a devout roman catholic with reputedly close ties to the vatican , antagonized left-wing and liberal european members of parliament last week when he said during a confirmation hearing that homosexuality was " a sin " and a woman 's role was to have children and be protected by their husbands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner designate for justice , freedom and security rocco buttiglione attends the hearing session at the european parliament in brussels , tuesday oct .
5 , 2004 .
" i may think that homosexuality is a sin , and this has no effect on politics , unless i say that homosexuality is a crime , " said the italian as he pledged to nonetheless defend the rights of gays .
incensed by what he referred to as a leftist lobby whose hostility towards him was based on " prejudices against his moral and religious convictions and the fact that he belonged to the berlusconi government , " buttiglione told the il messagero daily on tuesday he had no intention of withdrawing as a commission candidate .
" many of my comments were misunderstood , they were interpreted maliciously , with prejudice .
i never said , for example , that women should be locked up at home to have children , " he told the paper .
" i said that it is useful for women with children to have a husband nearby that can support her morally and economically . "
propaganda or legitimate concerns ?
reacting to the vote , berlsuconi also accused left-leaning italian meps of waging " crude propaganda " and said the vote marked a " dreadful start " to the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi accuses left-leaning politicians of waging a crude propaganda campaign " the very idea of disputing the freedom of conscience and opinion of a commissioner of catholic faith , contesting his own secular distinction between morality and law , smells of fundamentalism if not obscurantism , " berlusconi said in comments published in foglio newspaper tuesday .
but the civil liberties committee said it was precisely buttiglione 's beliefs that concerned them .
johannes svoboda , second in charge of the parliament 's socialist group , was among those who doubted the italian was suitable for heading the eu 's justice commission .
speaking with deutsche welle , svoboda said he was worried buttiglione would turn europe 's progress around .
" if buttiglione wants to send women back to the kitchen , if he thinks that homosexuality is a sin - these are opinions that at this time , for someone who is responsible for the realization of measures against discrimination , for freedom and equality of women - they simply do n't match , " he explained .
domino effect ?
the european commission declined to respond immediately to the rejection of buttiglione by the parliamentary committee , making clear it was only one stage in the process of approving the incoming commission to be headed by barroso .
the european parliament , which has no formal power to reject individual commissioners , only has the right to approve or reject the entire 25-member commission as a whole , when it votes on oct .
27 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : designated eu commission president barroso and his 24 commissioners still await final approval the rejection of buttiglione , however , could increase pressure on barroso to change his team before it takes up office on nov .
1 , especially as other commission-nominees face criticism in brussels and back home .
some meps are already predicting a domino effect following monday 's vote against buttiglione .
it is widely thought that the conservative european people 's party may strike back at the challenge to buttiglione by raising objections to laszlo kovascs , hungary 's nominee to the energy commission and a former communist .
" i realize this is politics , but it would be a shame if , merely because of politics , good people get in trouble in the confirmations simply because of a knock-on effect , " the civil liberties committee vice-president , greek socialist stavros lambrinidis , told euobserver .
the dutch nominee for the competition commission , neelie kroes , has also faced objection from several quarters for her past connection to big business .

the commons public accounts committee said the sentences must be " effectively and consistently " administered to be a " credible " alternative to custody .
the mps questioned the amount being spent on custody for youngsters .
the youth justice board , which helps to rehabilitate youths in england and wales , is to examine their findings .
in the field of community sentencing , the report found the flagship intensive surveillance and supervision programme -lrb- issp -rrb- was completed by fewer than half of those sent on it .
the issp involves curfews and 25 hours a week of therapy and education for offenders .
the report said : " the board should identify why some offenders fail to complete the programme and review differences in the way youth offending teams manage offenders on the programme . "
the youth justice board needs to work closely with the courts to ensure there is sufficient space in custody on the one hand , and to improve the courts ' confidence in community service on the other edward leigh drive to improve youths ' image the mps ' report finds rates of jail terms for young offenders differed widely across england and wales .
providing jail places for young offenders used £ 283m of the board 's £ 394m annual budget .
but the report found that , of the 7 % of young offenders given custodial sentences , 80 % reoffended on their release .
committee chairman edward leigh said the levels of re-offending showed " locking up these offenders is only part of the answer " .
he said : " the youth justice board needs to work closely with the courts to ensure there is sufficient space in custody on the one hand and to improve the courts ' confidence in community service on the other . "
the committee found the board had difficulty finding space for young offenders in some areas of the country , particularly in the south east and south west of england .

the inflated sum would eat into already overstretched trusts ' budgets , the magazine computer weekly says .
but health minister john hutton said the nhs would not be expected to carry an unsustainable financial burden .
the 10-year it programme includes plans to give 50 million patients in england an electronic health record .
the department of health said the cost of implementation should be seen in the context of its spending on the nhs .
overspend public spending watchdog the national audit office is investigating the programme .
it hopes to report by summer 2005 on the way the system to be installed was chosen , and whether it offers value for money .
the it programme should allow doctors to access information about a patient , via their record , whether they are at their local gp surgery or at a hospital at the other end of the country . "
many health trusts are currently in deficit and would struggle to find money for a centrally imposed project of this scale . "
shadow health secretary , andrew lansley patients should also be able to book appointments and operations using an electronic booking system .
computer weekly said it had learned that officials at the department of health had estimated the total costs of the programme at between £ 18.6bn and £ 31bn .
the declared cost was £ 6.2bn.
a spokesperson for the programme told computer weekly the estimates had been based on us experiences .
" it is generally accepted in the it industry that implementation costs are some three to five times the cost of procurements .
that is reflected in the business case that was made for the national programme , " said the spokesperson .
budget-busting some trusts are warning that money for the programme may eat into local budgets that are for direct patient care and meeting government targets . "
we are not going to ask the nhs to carry an unsustainable financial burden . "
john hutton liberal democrat shadow chancellor vince cable told computer weekly : " local health trusts will be forced to make very difficult decisions to support the national programme with local funding .
" this could mean cuts in other frontline services if the project is to be delivered .
the future success of the nhs depends on this project . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " the nao 's unusual decision to investigate the programme at this early stage is entirely appropriate given the fears we have that it will fall short of expectations and cost considerably more than originally anticipated .
" the government needs to be transparent about where the extra costs will fall , as many health trusts are currently in deficit and would struggle to find money for a centrally imposed project of this scale , without seriously cutting local service delivery . "
dr john williams , an it spokesman for the royal college of general practitioners , welcomed the national audit office investigation .
he said apart from the tendency for such projects to over-run and over-spend , gps were also worried about the safe transfer of patient records to the new national computer system .
speculation health minister john hutton insisted the cost estimates were simply " speculation " .
he told the bbc radio 4 today programme the £ 1bn already spent each year on it would be available for the new system .
" all that has happened today is that someone has speculated about what the overall costs might be .
" we are not going to ask the nhs to carry an unsustainable financial burden .
we are not stupid .
" the national system for it carries the potential for making major savings in terms of efficiency and patient safety . "
he stressed that implementation of the new system should cost no more than the £ 1bn already being spent each year on it .

the pensions commission report is expected to say that britons are saving far too little for their retirement .
a lack of public confidence in pensions is likely to be cited as a reason for low uk savings , with the problem exacerbated by longer life spans .
but the commission will not recommend a course of action until next year .
dark picture adair turner , head of the pensions commission , was asked in 2002 to lift the lid on the state of uk retirement provision .
checklist : how to find out your pension entitlement the commission has been given unheard of access to all relevant departments of state to gain a thorough understanding of uk pensions .
the report is expected to paint a dark picture of the likely costs of improved life expectancy .
analysts have long warned that an ageing population means there will soon be too few taxpayers to support the over-65s through the state pension .
" the big challenge is arising from the one very simple fact that we 're living longer and we 're having fewer children - it is basic demographics , " mr turner told bbc breakfast news .

the system uses computer technology which , if successful , would allow trains to run closer together and therefore increase frequency .
it involves an antenna , fitted beneath each london underground -lrb- lu -rrb- train , which send signals to the track via cables on the line .
this then allows position of the train to be pinpointed to within millimetres .
the system would first be used on the jubilee , piccadilly and northern lines .
dr siv bhamra from tube lines , one of the underground maintenance contractors , told bbc london : " when implementation is complete using modern technology it will be possible to substantially reduce crowding by allowing more trains to run together safely at much higher speeds than is possible within the constraints of existing signalling equipment .
" this is a proven , in-service technology and part of the testing we are doing today is to make sure it does n't go wrong . "

julio -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the street children who regularly plays games after a two-year study , the centre for media studies research institute concluded that gaming helps children improve their reading on screen and their ability to resolve conflicts .
it seems to be key in developing strategies to overcome obstacles and reach goals , and even in allowing them back into mainstream society .
according to this study , eight out of 10 of the up to 5,000 children living or working in the streets of buenos aires are regular game players , mostly in cyber cafés and arcades .
" we found that kids from the streets learn playing with video games , " sociologist tatiana merlo flores told the bbc programme go digital .
" we also witnessed a very strong social inclusion and empowerment process .
they learn from each other . "
cyber friends this trend is also being seen in other countries around the world .
the next step , researchers say , is to make use of this potential as a true alternative learning tool , and for that they want to appeal to the games software industry .
street children and gaming 80 % are regular game players 95 % of boys go to cyber cafés and arcades almost daily girls prefer home console games 66 % prefer non violent games source : centre for media studies , buenos aires the centre for media studies in buenos aires also identified the development of a one-to-one relationship between the teens and other regulars at the arcades or cyber cafés .
this can be seen in downtown buenos aires at lunchtime , where it is not unusual to see a office worker playing alongside a street child .
" in that moment , they are all friends , and they play in the same level .
the kids broke the digital divide , although they do n't know it " , said dr merlo flores , who teaches at the university of buenos aires and at the catholic university of argentina .
julio , a 15-year-old teenager who works on the streets and dreams of managing a cyber café , has first-hand experience of such an episode .
" i have a businessman friend who works with computers .
i 've spent a year playing alongside him , " said julio .
" we would always meet at the store he had in downtown buenos aires .
we have become very close friends . "
some children even have an e-mail , and they share it with their peers , in order to communicate with friends both from argentina and the rest of the world .
learning tool tatiana merlo flores stresses that games provide street children with the challenge and the encouragement that they not always get from school .
most of the boys go to arcades or cyber cafés every day " you can see them , leaving their packages and containers with paper and cartons , and get into these arcades to play , " she said .
" they might spend up to half of their wages in that .
they pay for this informal way of learning , because this is actually learning . "
the next step forward , according to her , is to knock on the door of the big games software companies in order to be able to make full use of the potential of games .
" if we work with them , this could be a wonderful way to promote learning , in a way that children already want , " said dr merlo flores .

julio -lrb- right -rrb- is one of the street children who regularly plays games after a two-year study , the centre for media studies research institute concluded that gaming helps children improve their reading on screen and their ability to resolve conflicts .
it seems to be key in developing strategies to overcome obstacles and reach goals , and even in allowing them back into mainstream society .
according to this study , eight out of 10 of the up to 5,000 children living or working in the streets of buenos aires are regular game players , mostly in cyber cafés and arcades .
" we found that kids from the streets learn playing with video games , " sociologist tatiana merlo flores told the bbc programme go digital .
" we also witnessed a very strong social inclusion and empowerment process .
they learn from each other . "
cyber friends this trend is also being seen in other countries around the world .
the next step , researchers say , is to make use of this potential as a true alternative learning tool , and for that they want to appeal to the games software industry .
street children and gaming 80 % are regular game players 95 % of boys go to cyber cafés and arcades almost daily girls prefer home console games 66 % prefer non violent games source : centre for media studies , buenos aires the centre for media studies in buenos aires also identified the development of a one-to-one relationship between the teens and other regulars at the arcades or cyber cafés .
this can be seen in downtown buenos aires at lunchtime , where it is not unusual to see a office worker playing alongside a street child .
" in that moment , they are all friends , and they play in the same level .
the kids broke the digital divide , although they do n't know it " , said dr merlo flores , who teaches at the university of buenos aires and at the catholic university of argentina .
julio , a 15-year-old teenager who works on the streets and dreams of managing a cyber café , has first-hand experience of such an episode .
" i have a businessman friend who works with computers .
i 've spent a year playing alongside him , " said julio .
" we would always meet at the store he had in downtown buenos aires .
we have become very close friends . "
some children even have an e-mail , and they share it with their peers , in order to communicate with friends both from argentina and the rest of the world .
learning tool tatiana merlo flores stresses that games provide street children with the challenge and the encouragement that they not always get from school .
most of the boys go to arcades or cyber cafés every day " you can see them , leaving their packages and containers with paper and cartons , and get into these arcades to play , " she said .
" they might spend up to half of their wages in that .
they pay for this informal way of learning , because this is actually learning . "
the next step forward , according to her , is to knock on the door of the big games software companies in order to be able to make full use of the potential of games .
" if we work with them , this could be a wonderful way to promote learning , in a way that children already want , " said dr merlo flores .

the lessons are being held at quarry view school , in south hylton , because some children are struggling to use a knife and fork when they start school .
child psychologist and parenting expert dr pat spungin said fast food and tv dinners are behind the declining standards at meal-times .
she said parents should recognise the importance of the family meal .
tricia bateley , head teacher of quarry view , said table manners are now part of citizenship lessons at the school .
parents should be getting back to the table and recognise that the family meal is an opportunity to teach good manners dr pat spungin she said : " citizenship lessons offer children the opportunity to develop attitudes to achieve a higher quality of life .
" when our children start school in september , we spend the first month sharing lunch with the children , encouraging and reinforcing table manners and etiquette . "
tv dinner culture , where families rarely sit down for a meal together , is blamed for the lack of table manners .
dr spungin said : " by the time they start school , children should be able to be quite proficient in using a knife and fork and i would have thought it should be the responsibility of the home .
" there is a lot of finger food around now - burgers , pizza and chips .
i think it may go hand in hand with something that concerns us and that is that families are not sitting down to eat like they used .
" it has all got to do with the decline of the family meal in some households .
parents should be getting back to the table and recognise that the family meal is an opportunity to teach good manners , how to hold a conversation and build bonds with other members the family , as well as generally eating better . "

david blaine 's 44 day-fast and sir ranulph fiennes ' example of extreme endurance showed how the body behaves under such circumstances .
but experts who were involved in the high-profile projects say they also offered clues as to how diet and exercise should be managed for everyone .
doctors will present their findings to a conference at the royal college of physicians in london on tuesday .
an estimated 18 to 40 % of hospital patients are believed to be under-nourished .
jeremy powell-tuck , who is professor of clinical nutrition at barts and the london queen mary school of medicine , treated magician david blaine after he emerged after 44 days suspended in a perspex box above london .
professor powell-tuck supervised the " re-feeding " period , where blaine 's body was gradually re-introduced to food again , and he monitored the effects for the eight months it took david blaine to get back to his original weight .
david blaine had lost 25 % of his bodyweight , but he still had a healthy body mass index professor jeremy powell-tuck , barts and the london he told bbc news online it was useful to be able to study someone who was malnourished , but who was not affected by disease .
" david blaine had lost 25 % of his bodyweight , but he still had a healthy body mass index " , he said .
body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of your height in metres .
blaine 's bmi was 21.6 when he emerged from the box - which would normally be classed as healthy - but it had fallen from 29 .
professor powell-tuck added : " it shows doctors need to ask what a person 's normal weight is and what their weight is now .
if they have lost more than 10 % of their bodyweight , there is a problem . "
david blaine also became deficient in b vitamins .
" it showed that in just 44 days , someone can become dangerously deficient in b vitamins , which can lead to short-term problems .
" and if someone is undergoing re-feeding treatment in hospital , it is important they are also given vitamins , which does n't always happen . "
' evolutionary origins ' the conference will also hear from dr mike stroud of the institute of nutrition in southampton .
dr mike stroud with his marathon partner sir ranulph fiennes in 2003 , dr stroud completed seven marathons in seven days across seven continents alongside the explorer sir ranulph fiennes .
dr stroud said : " i have shown that , when you 're doing a great deal of exercise , the idea that exercise can not induce weight loss is ridiculous .
" i was eating 5,500 calories a day when i crossed the antarctic - but i lost three stone . "
" it 's an extreme example , but it shows that the idea that weight loss is all about diet and not activity has been over-emphasised . "
dr stroud said the chances of an overweight but active individual having a serious heart attack or stroke are raised by only 20 % compared to a lean active individual , whereas an inactive lean individual is close to being at 300 % greater risk .
he said people should not focus on having to go to the gym to lose weight , but should build exercise - such as walking - into their everyday lives .
professor peter kopelman , chair of the rcp 's nutrition committee said the conference would help raise the profile of a topic which received too little attention " nutrition remains a cinderella subject for many health professionals .
" doctors all too often fail to recognise the contribution that malnutrition , whether it be under- or over-nutrition , makes to disease processes . "
he said the conference would also examine how to address the epidemic of obesity in terms of prevention and management .

archaeologists and other experts on natural and cultural heritage are gathering in st andrews on tuesday .
the aim is to try to work out how to tackle the threat from erosion to thousands of historical sites .
delegates predict they will need a great deal of help to retrieve information about historic sites before the evidence is lost to the sea .
scientists stress that some sites have always been vulnerable to erosion but climate change is putting more coastline at risk . "

historic scotland estimates that as many as 12,000 archaeological sites may be lost to the sea , which is an average of one for every kilometre of coast .
one of the aims of the fife conference is to try to work out how communities can play a bigger part in recording valuable information before it disappears under the waves .
professor christopher smout , of the university st andrews , said : " there are so many new events , we have such heavy weather , there are new sites in danger of being washed away .
" we 're really in danger of losing things before we 've fully discovered what it is that we 've got . "
the professor said the potential losses ranged from coastal stone age settlements to mediaeval castles , 16th century salt pans , early harbours and second world war defences .
he is urging more recording of the coastline , undertaken by groups like shorewatch , to prioritise the best sites for excavation to rescue the most important artefacts .

salam pax told the bbc 's newsnight programme : " maybe , just maybe , once we have elections and we have a group of people who truly represent us all , this could be our ticket out of the mess we 're in now . "
he also warned the coalition against a hasty withdrawal from the region before a credible government took control in iraq , fearing flawed elections would mean any new leadership being seen as " another american puppet . "
if you 're going to have elections , have them properly .
anything else looks like an exit strategy salam pax " it 's very worrying , when you hear someone like donald rumsfeld saying that maybe we ca n't have elections all over the country , possibly excluding the sunni triangle and other troublesome areas in baghdad .
" sorry , that 's not the way to do it , it will not be credible again , it will have the same problems the governing council and interim government had , it will look like another american puppet .
exit strategy ?
" if you 're going to have elections , have them properly .
anything else looks like an exit strategy and that is just unacceptable . "
his comments come as the count in afghanistan 's landmark election was delayed following allegations the vote was flawed .
what 's really worrying is when the sight of a tank rolling by your car is just normal , but that 's just not what normal should look like salam pax as well as undermining any new government , the 30-year-old also told newsnight he feared the sudden withdrawal of troops and " ill-prepared " elections would see the country become a theocracy , and drew parallels to the leadership in countries like iran and saudi arabia .
he said that for iraqis to come out of saddam hussein 's oppressive regime to then " go into something just as oppressive " would mean they had " lost everything . "
" that 's what i worry about , if they withdraw now in the mess we 're in they might just leave us to the mullahs , and i do n't think that 's a very happy ending . "
looting and lawlessness the " baghdad blogger " , as salam pax became known , also said the coalition had made a mistake by not making it clearer to the iraqi people that they genuinely intended to help and then leave the country .
" they -lrb- coalition forces -rrb- should never have allowed the looting and the lawlessness to happen , this is where we lost trust . "
he said the failure to implement a visible reconstruction programme and to tackle the security situation were the most serious errors made during the occupation and had fuelled iraqi anger at foreign troops , helping to reinforce the belief that life was better under saddam .
" basically , we 're not safe in our own city .
this is where i live , this is where i want to go out with friends and family and we ca n't do that anymore because it 's not safe .
it 's full of explosions and bombs and tanks on the street .
" what 's really worrying is when the sight of a tank rolling by your car is just normal .
it does n't freak you out anymore , or frighten you .
it 's just another tank .
" that 's scary , but that 's our daily life .
but that 's just not what normal should look like . "
accidental film-maker salam pax - his real name has never been revealed - spent months writing an often bleakly humorous weblog detailing the fears and hardships of iraqi citizens as they prepared for the conflict .
he also courted considerable danger in writing the blog , something that did not escape his readers at the time , some of whom doubted his authenticity given the risk posed by saddam hussein 's regime .
he has now filmed seven video diaries for newsnight , which he describes as a logical extension of his blogs : " i was already writing about everyday life in baghdad , why not show it ? "
you think you know your people but no , you do n't .
now they are talking about things that were canned in for 30 years , it 's very exciting salam pax the films have been well received and have just been screened at the vancouver international film festival .
he says his transformation from student to film-maker was unimaginable under saddam 's regime .
" when i 'm introduced as a writer and film-maker the first thing i do is apologise , " he says .
" one year ago i was writing this weblog , now i 'm at a film festival .
it 's like a parallel universe . "
he is still writing a weblog but is keen to get other iraqis online .
" there are n't many iraqis from within iraq telling the world what the country is like , " he said .
" what you get is foreign journalists talking about how iraqis feel , not the iraqis themselves . "
he says there are now at least 30 other iraqi bloggers , which he describes as " the first step forward . "
in the meantime , he intends to continue with both his web log , called shut up you fat whiner ! , and making more films for newsnight .
" the films became a journey of discovery for me , what does my country look like now ?
most of the things surprised me as much as they would have the viewers .
" you think you know your people but no , you do n't .
now they are talking about things that were canned in for 30 years , it 's very exciting .
" as long as people are willing to look at what 's going on in iraq i think it 's very important to have iraqi voices telling the world what 's going on . "
salam pax has made seven short films for newsnight .

salam pax told the bbc 's newsnight programme : " maybe , just maybe , once we have elections and we have a group of people who truly represent us all , this could be our ticket out of the mess we 're in now . "
he also warned the coalition against a hasty withdrawal from the region before a credible government took control in iraq , fearing flawed elections would mean any new leadership being seen as " another american puppet . "
if you 're going to have elections , have them properly .

what 's really worrying is when the sight of a tank rolling by your car is just normal , but that 's just not what normal should look like salam pax as well as undermining any new government , the 30-year-old also told newsnight he feared the sudden withdrawal of troops and " ill-prepared " elections would see the country become a theocracy , and drew parallels to the leadership in countries like iran and saudi arabia .
he said that for iraqis to come out of saddam hussein 's oppressive regime to then " go into something just as oppressive " would mean they had " lost everything . "
" that 's what i worry about , if they withdraw now in the mess we 're in they might just leave us to the mullahs , and i do n't think that 's a very happy ending . "
looting and lawlessness the " baghdad blogger " , as salam pax became known , also said the coalition had made a mistake by not making it clearer to the iraqi people that they genuinely intended to help and then leave the country .
" they -lrb- coalition forces -rrb- should never have allowed the looting and the lawlessness to happen , this is where we lost trust . "
he said the failure to implement a visible reconstruction programme and to tackle the security situation were the most serious errors made during the occupation and had fuelled iraqi anger at foreign troops , helping to reinforce the belief that life was better under saddam .
" basically , we 're not safe in our own city .

a report from ofsted has examined how children with special needs are being included in mainstream schools .
it says the " hardest test " for the principle of inclusion comes with pupils with behaviour problems .
inspectors found there had been a 25 % increase in such pupils being sent to " referral units " for problem children .
there had also been a 10 % increase in pupils being sent by their local authorities to independent special schools .
integration the government has promoted the idea that where possible children with special educational needs should receive help within a mainstream school .
the intention is to give special needs pupils a greater sense of integration , rather than being taught in separate special schools .
david bell , chief inspector of schools in england , launching the report , said he did not advocate the shutting of special schools - and cautioned local authorities against their premature closure .
inspectors say that while there is a growing acceptance of the benefits of greater inclusion - there has not been much evidence of an increase in special needs pupils in mainstream schools .
" the report paints a varied picture of success so far .
most schools have been convinced of the benefits of inclusion , " he says .
" however , against common perceptions , the proportion of pupils with statements of special educational needs in mainstream schools has not yet been affected by the inclusion framework . "
" even the more committed head teachers had reservations when asked to admit pupils with high levels of need " david bell , chief inspector of schools in england the term " special needs " can cover a wide range of physical and behavioural difficulties .
and the report says the greatest difficulty in accommodating special needs pupils is with children with " social and behavioural " problems .
" there 's no point in running away from the fact that schools have difficulties with this .
it is the unresolved problem facing inclusion , " said mr bell .
" schools can be quite comfortable with looking after children with physical disabilities - but when it comes to behaviour problems , they also have to weigh up their responsibilities to other pupils .
" it is the issue where conflicts between meeting individual needs and ' efficient education for other children ' are the most difficult to reconcile , " says mr bell .
" inspectors found that even the more committed head teachers had reservations when asked to admit pupils with high levels of need , especially where they had previously attended mainstream schools without success " .
shortcomings a department for education and skills spokesperson said : " if a child is disruptive or violent then we support heads in their tough decisions to remove a child from mainstream provision - to a pupil referral unit or other alternative provision . "
there were also doubts about the quality of teaching for special needs pupils - and uncertainty about their expected levels of achievement .
" the teaching of pupils with special educational needs continues to be of varying quality , with a high proportion of lessons having shortcomings , " says the report .
" a minority of mainstream schools meet special needs very well , and others are becoming better at doing so . "
mr bell praised the efforts of the hampstead school in north west london , where the report was launched .
the school 's head teacher , andrew knowles , said inclusion was part of the ethos of the school - with facilities for pupils in wheelchairs and a support centre for 40 or 50 pupils with behavioural problems .
learning mentors he highlighted how much the staffing of inner-city schools had changed to help such pupils - with about 40 % of staff now non-teachers , including learning mentors , assistants and counsellors .
the special needs co-ordinator at the school , pat mikhail , also said that older pupils were being trained to mentor younger pupils .
and she said that such a range of approaches had helped to keep a low rate of exclusion .
the general secretary of the national union of teachers , steve sinnott , said ofsted 's report showed the enormous efforts schools had made .
" but i am concerned about aspects of the report .
schools can not be expected to include children with severe behavioural difficulties if teachers have tried and not been able to overcome the problems , " he said .
" teachers have to have regard for the education of all other children in the school .
their education must not be disrupted by the behaviour of children with special needs . "
the conservatives have promised to stop the closure of special schools , and education spokesman , tim collins , said that the inclusion policy meant that children have been " dumped on failing schools " .
" it is deeply unfortunate that the government 's ideological approach to the inclusion of special educational needs pupils in mainstream education has led to the closure of 70 special schools since 1997 , " he said .
