other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .
" we , the scientists , were the ones who were seeking to have this restrictive law in place because there are potentially huge ethical problems with research on stem cells . " strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say . " under the law , all research projects must be passed by ethical and science committees , while the use of specially-produced embryos for research , or any cloning to produce embryos , is forbidden in an attempt to counter abuse . different laws elsewhere in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed researchers will be allowed to use excess stocks of embryos produced naturally for artificial insemination as a source for stem cells , the government said .
denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

a boost in sunday shopping seems to be the cause . " very satisfactory " is how hubertus pellengahr , a spokesman for the german retailers association , described the start of this year 's christmas shopping season , which officially opened over the weekend .
adding to the thus-far positive outcome is the growth of a recent trend in germany : sunday shopping .
traditionally , shopping on sundays was tightly regulated and prohibitted except in a few rare cases .
now , however , an increasing number of stores are opening their doors on the day of rest .
shopping spark many simply allow shoppers through their doors to browse for what they might wish to buy on another day of the week .
the swedish furniture chain ikea , for example , has advertised with the " look only " principle in the hopes that customers will turn out on sundays when they have the time and come back to spend money during the work week . car dealerships have started operating on the same notion that comparison buyers want more time before they fork over the money .
but increasing numbers of stores have also opened for full-fledged consumption . retailers in berlin , dresden , potsdam and bonn , among other cities , have begun opening on sundays in an attempt to boast the shopping spirit before the end of the year .
the community council in each of the cities allows for four sunday shopping days per year , as long as none of them are in december .
" this was the initial spark for the christmas sales season , " pellengahr said referring to store openings on sunday , nov .
28 , which in germany marks the first advent . the retail association is reckoning with an increase of some 1.3 percent in november and december , up to around € 70 billion total sales , compared to the same period a year earlier .
a brighter season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weihnachtsmarkt in weimar despite the positive christmas season outlook , however , the retailers were sticking to their full-year prognosis for an overall decrease in sales of 0.5 percent .
their hope is that strong christmas sales will make up for extreme weakness in the october figures , which were down between 1.1 and 1.2 percent from last year .
over the weekend , sales increases were seen in many areas compared to last year , but above all in the purchase of decorative christmas items , the association said .
" the mood in the retail branch is lightening up , " pellengahr said .
" germans seem to have gotten in the mood for buying just in time for christmas . "
compensation for october according to association polls , the increase in demand began in the middle of november .
the industry even hopes to move the entire sales volume into the black by the end of november .
in addition , this year 's shopping season is longer than last year 's by two full selling days , pellengahr noted .
according to the research firm infratest-dimap , almost half of those asked said they had less money for christmas gifts this year than they did in 2003 .
some 47 percent said they had the same amount , while 8 percent said they had more .
the retail association speaker said customers should not count on meeting the same wave of price-slashing sales and rebates that swept the stores last year .
he said he assumed retailers learned from their mistake last year , when buyers kept their money in their pockets and waited for prices to drop . dw staff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online retail looking forward to christmas online shopping is the only bright spot in what is likely to be another bad christmas for the retail industry .

a boost in sunday shopping seems to be the cause . " very satisfactory " is how hubertus pellengahr , a spokesman for the german retailers association , described the start of this year 's christmas shopping season , which officially opened over the weekend .
adding to the thus-far positive outcome is the growth of a recent trend in germany : sunday shopping .

shopping spark many simply allow shoppers through their doors to browse for what they might wish to buy on another day of the week .
the swedish furniture chain ikea , for example , has advertised with the " look only " principle in the hopes that customers will turn out on sundays when they have the time and come back to spend money during the work week . car dealerships have started operating on the same notion that comparison buyers want more time before they fork over the money .

" perhaps schalke will get near us on the pitch but in financial terms they are 20 years behind , " said bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we have as much credit as schalke have debt . " but historically , the top team at christmas usually goes on to win the german crown in may , as was the case with werder bremen last season .
there are two match days left before the five-week winter break . vfb stuttgart meanwhile remains in third place despite sunday 's goalless draw against hanover 96 . on saturday , bayern , who went top of the league for the first time in 18 months last weekend , saw their domestic purple patch continue only days after their 5-1 champions league win over maccabi tel aviv .
vfl wolfsburg , who went down 3-2 to hertha berlin , dropped to forth place . bayern manager felix magath made four changes to the team that crushed tel aviv in midweek , but that did not help mainz .
after just 14 minutes on-form bayern striker claudio pizarro picked up a pass from brazilian ze roberto and rolled the ball into the net . the goal visibly lifted bayern and mehmet scholl , the star of the show against tel aviv , doubled the lead in the 35th minute .
dutch international roy makaay fed a sublime pass into the path of scholl who defied his 35 years with a great turn of speed to slide home from an acute angle . bildunterschrift : mainz were camped in their own half and makaay scored in the final seconds of the first half to make it 3-0 .
bayern eased off in the second half and three goals came in the latter stages .
showing a never-say-die spirit , the two goals from the newly promoted mainz came in the final six minutes . bremen beat dortmund in this campaign bremen are left clinging to the coat tails of bayern after a 2-0 win over borussia dortmund .
the french connection of johan micoud -lrb- 32 -rrb- and valerien ismael -lrb- 57 -rrb- helped sink dortmund and bremen are now eight points adrift of bayern . bildunterschrift : wolfsburg had the best home record in the league before facing berlin but the capital outfit showed no respect with a 3-2 triumph at the volkswagen arena .
the wolves came from two goals down to level at 2-2 but the day belonged to brazilian marcelinho who scored a hat-trick -lrb- 16 , 47 , 74 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : after a creditable 1-1 draw at real madrid in midweek bayer leverkusen registered a long overdue first away win of the campaign . bayer ran out 2-0 winners over hansa rostock courtesy of goals from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov -lrb- 36 -rrb- and ukraine ace andrei voronin -lrb- 63 -rrb- . basement boys hansa have now lost all eight of their home matches this season and look destined to be watching the bundesliga on television next term . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.11.2004 smoker 's paradise is a winner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is restricted in relatively few places in germany a german man won $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,500 -rrb- in an international non-smoking campaign .
advocates for a smoke-free germany hope the prize will boost efforts for a national ban on smoking in public places . karl-heinz evers was drawn from 700,000 participants worldwide in the " quit and win 2004 " campaign sponsored by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
the 53-year-old from the northern town of lübeck said he feels like he 's been reborn six months after he ended a smoking career of almost three packs of cigarettes daily for the past 32 years .
his pleasure has only been enhanced by the $ 10,000 prize he won . " i feel brilliant , " evers said -lrb- photo , below -rrb- .
" after smoking 60 cigarettes a day for such a long time , you feel greatly relieved and much more active .
i can ride my bicycle again and can do sports .
i couldn ’ t do all that before because i was really sick . " the campaign participants were required to pledge to stop smoking for four weeks from may 1 , 2004 . evers has n't lit up since april 20 . anti-smoking campaigners might complain about the fact that the prize has gone to germany of all countries , which is widely regarded as a smokers ' paradise with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions on where to light up . changing its image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz evers -lrb- left -rrb- managed to quit smoking after 32 years .
but that image of germany may no longer be accurate , seeing as no other country had more participants taking part in the who 's anti-smoking campaign this year , organizers of " quit and win 2004 " said .
with over 90,000 would-be non-smokers , germany topped the field , leaving cuba 's 81,000 and russia ’ s 60,000 participants in places two and three .
the campaign 's organizers were optimistic that germany 's bad habits might be changing for the better . " i 'm quite convinced that this big success of quit and win , and , of course , the luck in the international draw will contribute to the tobacco policy development in germany , " pekka puska , chairman of the campaign and head of the helsinki-based public health institute of finland , said .
" it is true that in germany there is fairly big pressure from the tobacco industry .
but i ’ m quite optimistic that these events and ultimately the support of people will lead to a positive development towards a smoke-free germany and also regarding cooperation within the european union , " puska said . cigarette tax benefits health recent statistics show that cigarette sales in germany are beginning to drop .
some say this is a result of higher taxes imposed on cigarettes this year .
the government intended to raise additional public revenues with the tax .
but the result was primarily a positive health effect , according to peter lang from the government-affiliated agency of health education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth smoking is still a problem in germany , where even schools allow pupils and teachers to light up .
" the latest figures show a clear effect resulting from the tax hike , " lang said .
" we can also say there is a marked reduction in tobacco consumption among 12 to 17-year-old youngsters .
after a decade of rising consumption , we are seeing the first decline of consumption from 28 percent to 23 percent of young people in this age category . " health experts say campaigns like " quit and win " or germany ’ s national smoke-free campaign can raise awareness and encourage more people to stop smoking .
with a success rate of 20 to 30 percent , they claim , the german national campaign alone has saved the lives of up to 60,000 people . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.11.2004 swiss approve stem cell research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now legal in switzerland in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .
other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .
" we , the scientists , were the ones who were seeking to have this restrictive law in place because there are potentially huge ethical problems with research on stem cells . " strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say . " under the law , all research projects must be passed by ethical and science committees , while the use of specially-produced embryos for research , or any cloning to produce embryos , is forbidden in an attempt to counter abuse . different laws elsewhere in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed researchers will be allowed to use excess stocks of embryos produced naturally for artificial insemination as a source for stem cells , the government said .
denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.11.2004 romania vote marred by fraud charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparent victor : adrian nastase celebrates amid rumors of fraud exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .
but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian police recruits wait to enter a voting station at a military unit near bucharest , romania sunday nov .
28 , 2004 .
basescu estimated that up to five percent of the votes cast sunday had been fraudulent , and appealed to nastase to make sure voting is fair in the run-off .
otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .
in three years , the country wants to join the european union .
the next president 's job will be to dry up the country 's rampant corruption and boost its ailing economy .
currently , one in three romanians live under the poverty level .
of the 44 percent of the country 's voters who turned out for sunday 's poll , the majority said they hoped the future would bring relief from rampant corruption and poverty . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how ukraine reached the brink of civil unrest here 's a brief rundown of how the crisis in ukraine developed during the election campaign that pitted prime minister viktor yanukovych , a pro-moscow politician , against pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko .

but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .

basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .

ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .

the swedish furniture chain ikea , for example , has advertised with the " look only " principle in the hopes that customers will turn out on sundays when they have the time and come back to spend money during the work week . car dealerships have started operating on the same notion that comparison buyers want more time before they fork over the money .

other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .
" we , the scientists , were the ones who were seeking to have this restrictive law in place because there are potentially huge ethical problems with research on stem cells . " strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say . " under the law , all research projects must be passed by ethical and science committees , while the use of specially-produced embryos for research , or any cloning to produce embryos , is forbidden in an attempt to counter abuse . different laws elsewhere in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed researchers will be allowed to use excess stocks of embryos produced naturally for artificial insemination as a source for stem cells , the government said .
denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

" the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .
" we , the scientists , were the ones who were seeking to have this restrictive law in place because there are potentially huge ethical problems with research on stem cells . " strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say . " under the law , all research projects must be passed by ethical and science committees , while the use of specially-produced embryos for research , or any cloning to produce embryos , is forbidden in an attempt to counter abuse . different laws elsewhere in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed researchers will be allowed to use excess stocks of embryos produced naturally for artificial insemination as a source for stem cells , the government said .
denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .

otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.11.2004 romania vote marred by fraud charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparent victor : adrian nastase celebrates amid rumors of fraud exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .
but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian police recruits wait to enter a voting station at a military unit near bucharest , romania sunday nov .
28 , 2004 .
basescu estimated that up to five percent of the votes cast sunday had been fraudulent , and appealed to nastase to make sure voting is fair in the run-off .
otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .

" we give him 24 hours to do that , " she said . the supreme court , which has previously shown its independence from the government , could annul the elections , order a partial or full recount , or reject the appeal . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pro-russia ukraine regions threaten break ukraine 's pro-russia regions threatened sunday to split off from the european-leaning west of the country as a disputed vote has left moscow and western capitals glowering at each other across a cold war-like divide .

other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .

" strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say . " under the law , all research projects must be passed by ethical and science committees , while the use of specially-produced embryos for research , or any cloning to produce embryos , is forbidden in an attempt to counter abuse . different laws elsewhere in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed researchers will be allowed to use excess stocks of embryos produced naturally for artificial insemination as a source for stem cells , the government said .
denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

" perhaps schalke will get near us on the pitch but in financial terms they are 20 years behind , " said bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we have as much credit as schalke have debt . " but historically , the top team at christmas usually goes on to win the german crown in may , as was the case with werder bremen last season .

a boost in sunday shopping seems to be the cause . " very satisfactory " is how hubertus pellengahr , a spokesman for the german retailers association , described the start of this year 's christmas shopping season , which officially opened over the weekend .
adding to the thus-far positive outcome is the growth of a recent trend in germany : sunday shopping .
traditionally , shopping on sundays was tightly regulated and prohibitted except in a few rare cases .
now , however , an increasing number of stores are opening their doors on the day of rest .
shopping spark many simply allow shoppers through their doors to browse for what they might wish to buy on another day of the week .
the swedish furniture chain ikea , for example , has advertised with the " look only " principle in the hopes that customers will turn out on sundays when they have the time and come back to spend money during the work week . car dealerships have started operating on the same notion that comparison buyers want more time before they fork over the money .
but increasing numbers of stores have also opened for full-fledged consumption . retailers in berlin , dresden , potsdam and bonn , among other cities , have begun opening on sundays in an attempt to boast the shopping spirit before the end of the year .
the community council in each of the cities allows for four sunday shopping days per year , as long as none of them are in december .
" this was the initial spark for the christmas sales season , " pellengahr said referring to store openings on sunday , nov .
28 , which in germany marks the first advent . the retail association is reckoning with an increase of some 1.3 percent in november and december , up to around € 70 billion total sales , compared to the same period a year earlier .
a brighter season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weihnachtsmarkt in weimar despite the positive christmas season outlook , however , the retailers were sticking to their full-year prognosis for an overall decrease in sales of 0.5 percent .
their hope is that strong christmas sales will make up for extreme weakness in the october figures , which were down between 1.1 and 1.2 percent from last year .
over the weekend , sales increases were seen in many areas compared to last year , but above all in the purchase of decorative christmas items , the association said .
" the mood in the retail branch is lightening up , " pellengahr said .
" germans seem to have gotten in the mood for buying just in time for christmas . "
compensation for october according to association polls , the increase in demand began in the middle of november .
the industry even hopes to move the entire sales volume into the black by the end of november .
in addition , this year 's shopping season is longer than last year 's by two full selling days , pellengahr noted .
according to the research firm infratest-dimap , almost half of those asked said they had less money for christmas gifts this year than they did in 2003 .
some 47 percent said they had the same amount , while 8 percent said they had more .
the retail association speaker said customers should not count on meeting the same wave of price-slashing sales and rebates that swept the stores last year .
he said he assumed retailers learned from their mistake last year , when buyers kept their money in their pockets and waited for prices to drop . dw staff -lrb- jab -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de online retail looking forward to christmas online shopping is the only bright spot in what is likely to be another bad christmas for the retail industry .

" perhaps schalke will get near us on the pitch but in financial terms they are 20 years behind , " said bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we have as much credit as schalke have debt . " but historically , the top team at christmas usually goes on to win the german crown in may , as was the case with werder bremen last season .
there are two match days left before the five-week winter break . vfb stuttgart meanwhile remains in third place despite sunday 's goalless draw against hanover 96 . on saturday , bayern , who went top of the league for the first time in 18 months last weekend , saw their domestic purple patch continue only days after their 5-1 champions league win over maccabi tel aviv .
vfl wolfsburg , who went down 3-2 to hertha berlin , dropped to forth place . bayern manager felix magath made four changes to the team that crushed tel aviv in midweek , but that did not help mainz .
after just 14 minutes on-form bayern striker claudio pizarro picked up a pass from brazilian ze roberto and rolled the ball into the net . the goal visibly lifted bayern and mehmet scholl , the star of the show against tel aviv , doubled the lead in the 35th minute .
dutch international roy makaay fed a sublime pass into the path of scholl who defied his 35 years with a great turn of speed to slide home from an acute angle . bildunterschrift : mainz were camped in their own half and makaay scored in the final seconds of the first half to make it 3-0 .
bayern eased off in the second half and three goals came in the latter stages .
showing a never-say-die spirit , the two goals from the newly promoted mainz came in the final six minutes . bremen beat dortmund in this campaign bremen are left clinging to the coat tails of bayern after a 2-0 win over borussia dortmund .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.11.2004 romania vote marred by fraud charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparent victor : adrian nastase celebrates amid rumors of fraud exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .
but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian police recruits wait to enter a voting station at a military unit near bucharest , romania sunday nov .
28 , 2004 .
basescu estimated that up to five percent of the votes cast sunday had been fraudulent , and appealed to nastase to make sure voting is fair in the run-off .
otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .
in three years , the country wants to join the european union .
the next president 's job will be to dry up the country 's rampant corruption and boost its ailing economy .
currently , one in three romanians live under the poverty level .
of the 44 percent of the country 's voters who turned out for sunday 's poll , the majority said they hoped the future would bring relief from rampant corruption and poverty . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how ukraine reached the brink of civil unrest here 's a brief rundown of how the crisis in ukraine developed during the election campaign that pitted prime minister viktor yanukovych , a pro-moscow politician , against pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko .

the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .

basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .

ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.11.2004 romania vote marred by fraud charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparent victor : adrian nastase celebrates amid rumors of fraud exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .
but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian police recruits wait to enter a voting station at a military unit near bucharest , romania sunday nov .
28 , 2004 .
basescu estimated that up to five percent of the votes cast sunday had been fraudulent , and appealed to nastase to make sure voting is fair in the run-off .
otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .
in three years , the country wants to join the european union .
the next president 's job will be to dry up the country 's rampant corruption and boost its ailing economy .
currently , one in three romanians live under the poverty level .
of the 44 percent of the country 's voters who turned out for sunday 's poll , the majority said they hoped the future would bring relief from rampant corruption and poverty . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how ukraine reached the brink of civil unrest here 's a brief rundown of how the crisis in ukraine developed during the election campaign that pitted prime minister viktor yanukovych , a pro-moscow politician , against pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.11.2004 romania vote marred by fraud charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparent victor : adrian nastase celebrates amid rumors of fraud exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .
but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian police recruits wait to enter a voting station at a military unit near bucharest , romania sunday nov .
28 , 2004 .
basescu estimated that up to five percent of the votes cast sunday had been fraudulent , and appealed to nastase to make sure voting is fair in the run-off .
otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .
in three years , the country wants to join the european union .
the next president 's job will be to dry up the country 's rampant corruption and boost its ailing economy .
currently , one in three romanians live under the poverty level .
of the 44 percent of the country 's voters who turned out for sunday 's poll , the majority said they hoped the future would bring relief from rampant corruption and poverty . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how ukraine reached the brink of civil unrest here 's a brief rundown of how the crisis in ukraine developed during the election campaign that pitted prime minister viktor yanukovych , a pro-moscow politician , against pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko .

other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos .

advocates for a smoke-free germany hope the prize will boost efforts for a national ban on smoking in public places . karl-heinz evers was drawn from 700,000 participants worldwide in the " quit and win 2004 " campaign sponsored by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
the 53-year-old from the northern town of lübeck said he feels like he 's been reborn six months after he ended a smoking career of almost three packs of cigarettes daily for the past 32 years .
his pleasure has only been enhanced by the $ 10,000 prize he won . " i feel brilliant , " evers said -lrb- photo , below -rrb- .
" after smoking 60 cigarettes a day for such a long time , you feel greatly relieved and much more active .
i can ride my bicycle again and can do sports .
i couldn ’ t do all that before because i was really sick . " the campaign participants were required to pledge to stop smoking for four weeks from may 1 , 2004 . evers has n't lit up since april 20 . anti-smoking campaigners might complain about the fact that the prize has gone to germany of all countries , which is widely regarded as a smokers ' paradise with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions on where to light up . changing its image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz evers -lrb- left -rrb- managed to quit smoking after 32 years .
but that image of germany may no longer be accurate , seeing as no other country had more participants taking part in the who 's anti-smoking campaign this year , organizers of " quit and win 2004 " said .
with over 90,000 would-be non-smokers , germany topped the field , leaving cuba 's 81,000 and russia ’ s 60,000 participants in places two and three .
the campaign 's organizers were optimistic that germany 's bad habits might be changing for the better . " i 'm quite convinced that this big success of quit and win , and , of course , the luck in the international draw will contribute to the tobacco policy development in germany , " pekka puska , chairman of the campaign and head of the helsinki-based public health institute of finland , said .
" it is true that in germany there is fairly big pressure from the tobacco industry .
but i ’ m quite optimistic that these events and ultimately the support of people will lead to a positive development towards a smoke-free germany and also regarding cooperation within the european union , " puska said . cigarette tax benefits health recent statistics show that cigarette sales in germany are beginning to drop .
some say this is a result of higher taxes imposed on cigarettes this year .
the government intended to raise additional public revenues with the tax .
but the result was primarily a positive health effect , according to peter lang from the government-affiliated agency of health education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth smoking is still a problem in germany , where even schools allow pupils and teachers to light up .
" the latest figures show a clear effect resulting from the tax hike , " lang said .
" we can also say there is a marked reduction in tobacco consumption among 12 to 17-year-old youngsters .
after a decade of rising consumption , we are seeing the first decline of consumption from 28 percent to 23 percent of young people in this age category . " health experts say campaigns like " quit and win " or germany ’ s national smoke-free campaign can raise awareness and encourage more people to stop smoking .
with a success rate of 20 to 30 percent , they claim , the german national campaign alone has saved the lives of up to 60,000 people . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

" perhaps schalke will get near us on the pitch but in financial terms they are 20 years behind , " said bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we have as much credit as schalke have debt . " but historically , the top team at christmas usually goes on to win the german crown in may , as was the case with werder bremen last season .
there are two match days left before the five-week winter break . vfb stuttgart meanwhile remains in third place despite sunday 's goalless draw against hanover 96 . on saturday , bayern , who went top of the league for the first time in 18 months last weekend , saw their domestic purple patch continue only days after their 5-1 champions league win over maccabi tel aviv .
vfl wolfsburg , who went down 3-2 to hertha berlin , dropped to forth place . bayern manager felix magath made four changes to the team that crushed tel aviv in midweek , but that did not help mainz .
after just 14 minutes on-form bayern striker claudio pizarro picked up a pass from brazilian ze roberto and rolled the ball into the net . the goal visibly lifted bayern and mehmet scholl , the star of the show against tel aviv , doubled the lead in the 35th minute .
dutch international roy makaay fed a sublime pass into the path of scholl who defied his 35 years with a great turn of speed to slide home from an acute angle . bildunterschrift : mainz were camped in their own half and makaay scored in the final seconds of the first half to make it 3-0 .
bayern eased off in the second half and three goals came in the latter stages .
showing a never-say-die spirit , the two goals from the newly promoted mainz came in the final six minutes . bremen beat dortmund in this campaign bremen are left clinging to the coat tails of bayern after a 2-0 win over borussia dortmund .
the french connection of johan micoud -lrb- 32 -rrb- and valerien ismael -lrb- 57 -rrb- helped sink dortmund and bremen are now eight points adrift of bayern . bildunterschrift : wolfsburg had the best home record in the league before facing berlin but the capital outfit showed no respect with a 3-2 triumph at the volkswagen arena .
the wolves came from two goals down to level at 2-2 but the day belonged to brazilian marcelinho who scored a hat-trick -lrb- 16 , 47 , 74 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : after a creditable 1-1 draw at real madrid in midweek bayer leverkusen registered a long overdue first away win of the campaign . bayer ran out 2-0 winners over hansa rostock courtesy of goals from bulgarian international dimitar berbatov -lrb- 36 -rrb- and ukraine ace andrei voronin -lrb- 63 -rrb- . basement boys hansa have now lost all eight of their home matches this season and look destined to be watching the bundesliga on television next term . dw staff / afp -lrb- mry / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's soccer diplomats germany exports soccer projects like other countries export steel or coal .

" perhaps schalke will get near us on the pitch but in financial terms they are 20 years behind , " said bayern general manager uli hoeness .
" we have as much credit as schalke have debt . " but historically , the top team at christmas usually goes on to win the german crown in may , as was the case with werder bremen last season .

dutch international roy makaay fed a sublime pass into the path of scholl who defied his 35 years with a great turn of speed to slide home from an acute angle . bildunterschrift : mainz were camped in their own half and makaay scored in the final seconds of the first half to make it 3-0 .
bayern eased off in the second half and three goals came in the latter stages .
showing a never-say-die spirit , the two goals from the newly promoted mainz came in the final six minutes . bremen beat dortmund in this campaign bremen are left clinging to the coat tails of bayern after a 2-0 win over borussia dortmund .

advocates for a smoke-free germany hope the prize will boost efforts for a national ban on smoking in public places . karl-heinz evers was drawn from 700,000 participants worldwide in the " quit and win 2004 " campaign sponsored by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
the 53-year-old from the northern town of lübeck said he feels like he 's been reborn six months after he ended a smoking career of almost three packs of cigarettes daily for the past 32 years .
his pleasure has only been enhanced by the $ 10,000 prize he won . " i feel brilliant , " evers said -lrb- photo , below -rrb- .
" after smoking 60 cigarettes a day for such a long time , you feel greatly relieved and much more active .
i can ride my bicycle again and can do sports .
i couldn ’ t do all that before because i was really sick . " the campaign participants were required to pledge to stop smoking for four weeks from may 1 , 2004 . evers has n't lit up since april 20 . anti-smoking campaigners might complain about the fact that the prize has gone to germany of all countries , which is widely regarded as a smokers ' paradise with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions on where to light up . changing its image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz evers -lrb- left -rrb- managed to quit smoking after 32 years .
but that image of germany may no longer be accurate , seeing as no other country had more participants taking part in the who 's anti-smoking campaign this year , organizers of " quit and win 2004 " said .
with over 90,000 would-be non-smokers , germany topped the field , leaving cuba 's 81,000 and russia ’ s 60,000 participants in places two and three .
the campaign 's organizers were optimistic that germany 's bad habits might be changing for the better . " i 'm quite convinced that this big success of quit and win , and , of course , the luck in the international draw will contribute to the tobacco policy development in germany , " pekka puska , chairman of the campaign and head of the helsinki-based public health institute of finland , said .
" it is true that in germany there is fairly big pressure from the tobacco industry .
but i ’ m quite optimistic that these events and ultimately the support of people will lead to a positive development towards a smoke-free germany and also regarding cooperation within the european union , " puska said . cigarette tax benefits health recent statistics show that cigarette sales in germany are beginning to drop .
some say this is a result of higher taxes imposed on cigarettes this year .
the government intended to raise additional public revenues with the tax .
but the result was primarily a positive health effect , according to peter lang from the government-affiliated agency of health education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth smoking is still a problem in germany , where even schools allow pupils and teachers to light up .
" the latest figures show a clear effect resulting from the tax hike , " lang said .
" we can also say there is a marked reduction in tobacco consumption among 12 to 17-year-old youngsters .
after a decade of rising consumption , we are seeing the first decline of consumption from 28 percent to 23 percent of young people in this age category . " health experts say campaigns like " quit and win " or germany ’ s national smoke-free campaign can raise awareness and encourage more people to stop smoking .
with a success rate of 20 to 30 percent , they claim , the german national campaign alone has saved the lives of up to 60,000 people . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

a boost in sunday shopping seems to be the cause . " very satisfactory " is how hubertus pellengahr , a spokesman for the german retailers association , described the start of this year 's christmas shopping season , which officially opened over the weekend .
adding to the thus-far positive outcome is the growth of a recent trend in germany : sunday shopping .
traditionally , shopping on sundays was tightly regulated and prohibitted except in a few rare cases .
now , however , an increasing number of stores are opening their doors on the day of rest .
shopping spark many simply allow shoppers through their doors to browse for what they might wish to buy on another day of the week .
the swedish furniture chain ikea , for example , has advertised with the " look only " principle in the hopes that customers will turn out on sundays when they have the time and come back to spend money during the work week . car dealerships have started operating on the same notion that comparison buyers want more time before they fork over the money .
but increasing numbers of stores have also opened for full-fledged consumption . retailers in berlin , dresden , potsdam and bonn , among other cities , have begun opening on sundays in an attempt to boast the shopping spirit before the end of the year .

their hope is that strong christmas sales will make up for extreme weakness in the october figures , which were down between 1.1 and 1.2 percent from last year .
over the weekend , sales increases were seen in many areas compared to last year , but above all in the purchase of decorative christmas items , the association said .
" the mood in the retail branch is lightening up , " pellengahr said .
" germans seem to have gotten in the mood for buying just in time for christmas . "
compensation for october according to association polls , the increase in demand began in the middle of november .
the industry even hopes to move the entire sales volume into the black by the end of november .
in addition , this year 's shopping season is longer than last year 's by two full selling days , pellengahr noted .
according to the research firm infratest-dimap , almost half of those asked said they had less money for christmas gifts this year than they did in 2003 .
some 47 percent said they had the same amount , while 8 percent said they had more .

other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .
" we , the scientists , were the ones who were seeking to have this restrictive law in place because there are potentially huge ethical problems with research on stem cells . " strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say .

denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian police recruits wait to enter a voting station at a military unit near bucharest , romania sunday nov .
28 , 2004 .
basescu estimated that up to five percent of the votes cast sunday had been fraudulent , and appealed to nastase to make sure voting is fair in the run-off .
otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .
in three years , the country wants to join the european union .
the next president 's job will be to dry up the country 's rampant corruption and boost its ailing economy .
currently , one in three romanians live under the poverty level .
of the 44 percent of the country 's voters who turned out for sunday 's poll , the majority said they hoped the future would bring relief from rampant corruption and poverty . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how ukraine reached the brink of civil unrest here 's a brief rundown of how the crisis in ukraine developed during the election campaign that pitted prime minister viktor yanukovych , a pro-moscow politician , against pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko .

" if we really want to preserve peace and agreement in ukraine , and really want to build a legitimate democratic society that we so often talk about ... then let 's hold new elections , " kuchma said in televised remarks . kuchma said he was ready to seek new solutions to the crisis even if this meant stepping outside the standard procedures for resolving such standoffs .
" the situation we find ourselves in today in ukraine demands not only strictly legal decision , but also political decisions , " kuchma said . ukraine has been swept up in turmoil for more than a week by mass opposition street protests against alleged fraud in the poll , which was officially won by the pro-russian prime minister viktor yanukovych .

ukraine 's supreme court monday began reviewing a request by opposition leader viktor yushchenko to annul the results due to alleged ballot fraud .
the parliament has supported annulling the vote in a non-binding resolution . as pressure mounted on the pro-russia camp , with opposition demonstrators blocking government buildings and taking over central kiev , yanukovych appeared to have relented somewhat .
he said monday that even though he thought it would be illegal , he would agree to a new vote being held in two districts in eastern ukraine where turnout was suspiciously heavy in his favor . talk of secession the elections have threatened to split ukraine in half , with yushchenko vowing to pull ukraine out of russia 's orbit and placing the former soviet republic in the european union 's fold and possibly even joining the nato military alliance .

customs duties have fallen by a quarter , " said kuchma , according to a statement from the president 's office . economists warned that the longer the crisis persisted and the greater the threat of secession , the more damage would be suffered by the ukrainian economy , which powered ahead more than 12 percent over the first nine months of the year . " the situation is such today that the economy is hostage to the political situation , " said andrei blinov , head of the international center for policy studies . in other side-effects , for the last six days trading has been disrupted on the kiev stock exchange while the number of freight lorries entering the country has dropped to a third of the usual level . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine top court decides on election ukraine 's supreme court will convene monday to hear an opposition appeal that the presidential election was rigged in favor of pro-moscow premier viktor yanukovych , amid threats that the country could split in two .

but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .

otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.11.2004 romania vote marred by fraud charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : apparent victor : adrian nastase celebrates amid rumors of fraud exit polls in key romanian elections are showing a likely win for the ruling social democrats .
but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian police recruits wait to enter a voting station at a military unit near bucharest , romania sunday nov .
28 , 2004 .
basescu estimated that up to five percent of the votes cast sunday had been fraudulent , and appealed to nastase to make sure voting is fair in the run-off .
otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .
in three years , the country wants to join the european union .
the next president 's job will be to dry up the country 's rampant corruption and boost its ailing economy .
currently , one in three romanians live under the poverty level .
of the 44 percent of the country 's voters who turned out for sunday 's poll , the majority said they hoped the future would bring relief from rampant corruption and poverty . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how ukraine reached the brink of civil unrest here 's a brief rundown of how the crisis in ukraine developed during the election campaign that pitted prime minister viktor yanukovych , a pro-moscow politician , against pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.11.2004 swiss approve stem cell research großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now legal in switzerland in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .
other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .
" we , the scientists , were the ones who were seeking to have this restrictive law in place because there are potentially huge ethical problems with research on stem cells . " strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say . " under the law , all research projects must be passed by ethical and science committees , while the use of specially-produced embryos for research , or any cloning to produce embryos , is forbidden in an attempt to counter abuse . different laws elsewhere in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed researchers will be allowed to use excess stocks of embryos produced naturally for artificial insemination as a source for stem cells , the government said .
denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .
" we , the scientists , were the ones who were seeking to have this restrictive law in place because there are potentially huge ethical problems with research on stem cells . " strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say . " under the law , all research projects must be passed by ethical and science committees , while the use of specially-produced embryos for research , or any cloning to produce embryos , is forbidden in an attempt to counter abuse . different laws elsewhere in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed researchers will be allowed to use excess stocks of embryos produced naturally for artificial insemination as a source for stem cells , the government said .
denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .
" we , the scientists , were the ones who were seeking to have this restrictive law in place because there are potentially huge ethical problems with research on stem cells . " strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say . " under the law , all research projects must be passed by ethical and science committees , while the use of specially-produced embryos for research , or any cloning to produce embryos , is forbidden in an attempt to counter abuse . different laws elsewhere in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed researchers will be allowed to use excess stocks of embryos produced naturally for artificial insemination as a source for stem cells , the government said .
denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian police recruits wait to enter a voting station at a military unit near bucharest , romania sunday nov .
28 , 2004 .
basescu estimated that up to five percent of the votes cast sunday had been fraudulent , and appealed to nastase to make sure voting is fair in the run-off .
otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .
in three years , the country wants to join the european union .
the next president 's job will be to dry up the country 's rampant corruption and boost its ailing economy .
currently , one in three romanians live under the poverty level .
of the 44 percent of the country 's voters who turned out for sunday 's poll , the majority said they hoped the future would bring relief from rampant corruption and poverty . dw staff -lrb- jba -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how ukraine reached the brink of civil unrest here 's a brief rundown of how the crisis in ukraine developed during the election campaign that pitted prime minister viktor yanukovych , a pro-moscow politician , against pro-western opposition leader viktor yushchenko .

other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity .

" in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say .

advocates for a smoke-free germany hope the prize will boost efforts for a national ban on smoking in public places . karl-heinz evers was drawn from 700,000 participants worldwide in the " quit and win 2004 " campaign sponsored by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
the 53-year-old from the northern town of lübeck said he feels like he 's been reborn six months after he ended a smoking career of almost three packs of cigarettes daily for the past 32 years .
his pleasure has only been enhanced by the $ 10,000 prize he won . " i feel brilliant , " evers said -lrb- photo , below -rrb- .
" after smoking 60 cigarettes a day for such a long time , you feel greatly relieved and much more active .
i can ride my bicycle again and can do sports .
i couldn ’ t do all that before because i was really sick . " the campaign participants were required to pledge to stop smoking for four weeks from may 1 , 2004 . evers has n't lit up since april 20 . anti-smoking campaigners might complain about the fact that the prize has gone to germany of all countries , which is widely regarded as a smokers ' paradise with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions on where to light up . changing its image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz evers -lrb- left -rrb- managed to quit smoking after 32 years .
but that image of germany may no longer be accurate , seeing as no other country had more participants taking part in the who 's anti-smoking campaign this year , organizers of " quit and win 2004 " said .
with over 90,000 would-be non-smokers , germany topped the field , leaving cuba 's 81,000 and russia ’ s 60,000 participants in places two and three .
the campaign 's organizers were optimistic that germany 's bad habits might be changing for the better . " i 'm quite convinced that this big success of quit and win , and , of course , the luck in the international draw will contribute to the tobacco policy development in germany , " pekka puska , chairman of the campaign and head of the helsinki-based public health institute of finland , said .
" it is true that in germany there is fairly big pressure from the tobacco industry .
but i ’ m quite optimistic that these events and ultimately the support of people will lead to a positive development towards a smoke-free germany and also regarding cooperation within the european union , " puska said . cigarette tax benefits health recent statistics show that cigarette sales in germany are beginning to drop .
some say this is a result of higher taxes imposed on cigarettes this year .
the government intended to raise additional public revenues with the tax .
but the result was primarily a positive health effect , according to peter lang from the government-affiliated agency of health education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth smoking is still a problem in germany , where even schools allow pupils and teachers to light up .
" the latest figures show a clear effect resulting from the tax hike , " lang said .
" we can also say there is a marked reduction in tobacco consumption among 12 to 17-year-old youngsters .
after a decade of rising consumption , we are seeing the first decline of consumption from 28 percent to 23 percent of young people in this age category . " health experts say campaigns like " quit and win " or germany ’ s national smoke-free campaign can raise awareness and encourage more people to stop smoking .
with a success rate of 20 to 30 percent , they claim , the german national campaign alone has saved the lives of up to 60,000 people . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

advocates for a smoke-free germany hope the prize will boost efforts for a national ban on smoking in public places . karl-heinz evers was drawn from 700,000 participants worldwide in the " quit and win 2004 " campaign sponsored by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
the 53-year-old from the northern town of lübeck said he feels like he 's been reborn six months after he ended a smoking career of almost three packs of cigarettes daily for the past 32 years .
his pleasure has only been enhanced by the $ 10,000 prize he won . " i feel brilliant , " evers said -lrb- photo , below -rrb- .
" after smoking 60 cigarettes a day for such a long time , you feel greatly relieved and much more active .
i can ride my bicycle again and can do sports .
i couldn ’ t do all that before because i was really sick . " the campaign participants were required to pledge to stop smoking for four weeks from may 1 , 2004 . evers has n't lit up since april 20 . anti-smoking campaigners might complain about the fact that the prize has gone to germany of all countries , which is widely regarded as a smokers ' paradise with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions on where to light up . changing its image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz evers -lrb- left -rrb- managed to quit smoking after 32 years .
but that image of germany may no longer be accurate , seeing as no other country had more participants taking part in the who 's anti-smoking campaign this year , organizers of " quit and win 2004 " said .
with over 90,000 would-be non-smokers , germany topped the field , leaving cuba 's 81,000 and russia ’ s 60,000 participants in places two and three .
the campaign 's organizers were optimistic that germany 's bad habits might be changing for the better . " i 'm quite convinced that this big success of quit and win , and , of course , the luck in the international draw will contribute to the tobacco policy development in germany , " pekka puska , chairman of the campaign and head of the helsinki-based public health institute of finland , said .
" it is true that in germany there is fairly big pressure from the tobacco industry .
but i ’ m quite optimistic that these events and ultimately the support of people will lead to a positive development towards a smoke-free germany and also regarding cooperation within the european union , " puska said . cigarette tax benefits health recent statistics show that cigarette sales in germany are beginning to drop .
some say this is a result of higher taxes imposed on cigarettes this year .
the government intended to raise additional public revenues with the tax .
but the result was primarily a positive health effect , according to peter lang from the government-affiliated agency of health education . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youth smoking is still a problem in germany , where even schools allow pupils and teachers to light up .
" the latest figures show a clear effect resulting from the tax hike , " lang said .
" we can also say there is a marked reduction in tobacco consumption among 12 to 17-year-old youngsters .
after a decade of rising consumption , we are seeing the first decline of consumption from 28 percent to 23 percent of young people in this age category . " health experts say campaigns like " quit and win " or germany ’ s national smoke-free campaign can raise awareness and encourage more people to stop smoking .
with a success rate of 20 to 30 percent , they claim , the german national campaign alone has saved the lives of up to 60,000 people . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.11.2004 holiday retail sales off to a roaring start großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shopping streets , like this one in berlin , were full over the weekend the start of the christmas shopping season in germany has left retailers optimistic about an increase in profits after last year 's disappointing results .
a boost in sunday shopping seems to be the cause . " very satisfactory " is how hubertus pellengahr , a spokesman for the german retailers association , described the start of this year 's christmas shopping season , which officially opened over the weekend .
adding to the thus-far positive outcome is the growth of a recent trend in germany : sunday shopping .
traditionally , shopping on sundays was tightly regulated and prohibitted except in a few rare cases .
now , however , an increasing number of stores are opening their doors on the day of rest .
shopping spark many simply allow shoppers through their doors to browse for what they might wish to buy on another day of the week .
the swedish furniture chain ikea , for example , has advertised with the " look only " principle in the hopes that customers will turn out on sundays when they have the time and come back to spend money during the work week . car dealerships have started operating on the same notion that comparison buyers want more time before they fork over the money .
but increasing numbers of stores have also opened for full-fledged consumption . retailers in berlin , dresden , potsdam and bonn , among other cities , have begun opening on sundays in an attempt to boast the shopping spirit before the end of the year .
the community council in each of the cities allows for four sunday shopping days per year , as long as none of them are in december .
" this was the initial spark for the christmas sales season , " pellengahr said referring to store openings on sunday , nov .
28 , which in germany marks the first advent . the retail association is reckoning with an increase of some 1.3 percent in november and december , up to around € 70 billion total sales , compared to the same period a year earlier .
a brighter season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weihnachtsmarkt in weimar despite the positive christmas season outlook , however , the retailers were sticking to their full-year prognosis for an overall decrease in sales of 0.5 percent .
their hope is that strong christmas sales will make up for extreme weakness in the october figures , which were down between 1.1 and 1.2 percent from last year .
over the weekend , sales increases were seen in many areas compared to last year , but above all in the purchase of decorative christmas items , the association said .
" the mood in the retail branch is lightening up , " pellengahr said .
" germans seem to have gotten in the mood for buying just in time for christmas . "
compensation for october according to association polls , the increase in demand began in the middle of november .
the industry even hopes to move the entire sales volume into the black by the end of november .
in addition , this year 's shopping season is longer than last year 's by two full selling days , pellengahr noted .
according to the research firm infratest-dimap , almost half of those asked said they had less money for christmas gifts this year than they did in 2003 .
some 47 percent said they had the same amount , while 8 percent said they had more .

but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .

otherwise , he warned , romania would jeopardize its chances of joining the european union .
" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .
in three years , the country wants to join the european union .

a boost in sunday shopping seems to be the cause . " very satisfactory " is how hubertus pellengahr , a spokesman for the german retailers association , described the start of this year 's christmas shopping season , which officially opened over the weekend .
adding to the thus-far positive outcome is the growth of a recent trend in germany : sunday shopping .
traditionally , shopping on sundays was tightly regulated and prohibitted except in a few rare cases .
now , however , an increasing number of stores are opening their doors on the day of rest .
shopping spark many simply allow shoppers through their doors to browse for what they might wish to buy on another day of the week .
the swedish furniture chain ikea , for example , has advertised with the " look only " principle in the hopes that customers will turn out on sundays when they have the time and come back to spend money during the work week . car dealerships have started operating on the same notion that comparison buyers want more time before they fork over the money .
but increasing numbers of stores have also opened for full-fledged consumption . retailers in berlin , dresden , potsdam and bonn , among other cities , have begun opening on sundays in an attempt to boast the shopping spirit before the end of the year .
the community council in each of the cities allows for four sunday shopping days per year , as long as none of them are in december .
" this was the initial spark for the christmas sales season , " pellengahr said referring to store openings on sunday , nov .
28 , which in germany marks the first advent . the retail association is reckoning with an increase of some 1.3 percent in november and december , up to around € 70 billion total sales , compared to the same period a year earlier .
a brighter season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weihnachtsmarkt in weimar despite the positive christmas season outlook , however , the retailers were sticking to their full-year prognosis for an overall decrease in sales of 0.5 percent .
their hope is that strong christmas sales will make up for extreme weakness in the october figures , which were down between 1.1 and 1.2 percent from last year .
over the weekend , sales increases were seen in many areas compared to last year , but above all in the purchase of decorative christmas items , the association said .
" the mood in the retail branch is lightening up , " pellengahr said .
" germans seem to have gotten in the mood for buying just in time for christmas . "
compensation for october according to association polls , the increase in demand began in the middle of november .
the industry even hopes to move the entire sales volume into the black by the end of november .
in addition , this year 's shopping season is longer than last year 's by two full selling days , pellengahr noted .
according to the research firm infratest-dimap , almost half of those asked said they had less money for christmas gifts this year than they did in 2003 .
some 47 percent said they had the same amount , while 8 percent said they had more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.11.2004 smoker 's paradise is a winner großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking is restricted in relatively few places in germany a german man won $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,500 -rrb- in an international non-smoking campaign .
advocates for a smoke-free germany hope the prize will boost efforts for a national ban on smoking in public places . karl-heinz evers was drawn from 700,000 participants worldwide in the " quit and win 2004 " campaign sponsored by the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- .
the 53-year-old from the northern town of lübeck said he feels like he 's been reborn six months after he ended a smoking career of almost three packs of cigarettes daily for the past 32 years .
his pleasure has only been enhanced by the $ 10,000 prize he won . " i feel brilliant , " evers said -lrb- photo , below -rrb- .
" after smoking 60 cigarettes a day for such a long time , you feel greatly relieved and much more active .
i can ride my bicycle again and can do sports .
i couldn ’ t do all that before because i was really sick . " the campaign participants were required to pledge to stop smoking for four weeks from may 1 , 2004 . evers has n't lit up since april 20 . anti-smoking campaigners might complain about the fact that the prize has gone to germany of all countries , which is widely regarded as a smokers ' paradise with cheap cigarettes available from machines on street corners and very few restrictions on where to light up . changing its image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl-heinz evers -lrb- left -rrb- managed to quit smoking after 32 years .
but that image of germany may no longer be accurate , seeing as no other country had more participants taking part in the who 's anti-smoking campaign this year , organizers of " quit and win 2004 " said .
with over 90,000 would-be non-smokers , germany topped the field , leaving cuba 's 81,000 and russia ’ s 60,000 participants in places two and three .
the campaign 's organizers were optimistic that germany 's bad habits might be changing for the better . " i 'm quite convinced that this big success of quit and win , and , of course , the luck in the international draw will contribute to the tobacco policy development in germany , " pekka puska , chairman of the campaign and head of the helsinki-based public health institute of finland , said .
" it is true that in germany there is fairly big pressure from the tobacco industry .
but i ’ m quite optimistic that these events and ultimately the support of people will lead to a positive development towards a smoke-free germany and also regarding cooperation within the european union , " puska said . cigarette tax benefits health recent statistics show that cigarette sales in germany are beginning to drop .

german interior minister otto schily told this week 's edition of news magazine der spiegel that his long-term goal is that muslims in germany accept a ' european islam ' which respects the values of enlightenment and stands up for the rights of women .
an intellectual-political examination of islam is part of a program that he wants to press ahead with for the integration of immigrants , schily told the magazine .
he said that germany 's regions should be more rigorous about the possibility of deportation when integration efforts fail .
" they have to make more use of being able to deport hate preachers and similar figures than they have up to now , " said schily .
germany 's opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are also pushing for more discussion about german patriotism .
according to german daily handelsblatt , the cdu leader of hessen , roland koch , said the cdu should become the party " that safeguards german interests . "
edmund stoiber , leader of the cdu 's sister party in bavaria , the csu , told the tabloid bild am sonntag that everyone who lives in germany must respect the values there .
" i can imagine that every foreigner who wants to become german swears an oath to our constitution - something that is quite normal in many other countries , " said the bavarian leader .

but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .
christian parvulescu , president of the organization , told the afp news agence that the pullout was intended to " protest the failings of the romanian electoral system . "
as in ukraine , pro democracia said the ruling party had resorted to widescale vote rigging .

" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .
start of a new era ?
despite different approaches , both politicians said they wish to lead the impoverished balkan nation to eu membership in 2007 and retain the strong support of the united states .
the election of a new president in romania signifies the end of an era .

but as in ukraine , the opposition has demanded an investigation into voting irregularities . the ruling ex-communists appear to have taken the lead in both presidential and parliamentary elections in romania .
the balkan nation is aiming to join the european union in 2007 .
in the presidential election , exit polls sunday showed departing prime minister adrian nastase the front runner , with around 41 percent of the vote , to replace outgoing president ion iliescu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traian basescu but because he failed to win outright , nastase will take on center-right candidate traian basescu of the " justice and truth " alliance in a run-off election on december 12 .
basescu won between 35 and 38 percent of the vote .
charges of fraud in parliamentary elections , polls showed nastase 's social democrat -lrb- psd -rrb- party candidates in the lead with nearly 40 percent of the vote .
center-right opposition candidates took 35 percent of the vote .
however , charges of voting irregularities almost immediately rang through the country , echoing accusations in neighboring ukraine , which has been rocked for the past week by growing street protests against alleged election rigging .
romania 's main civil rights group said it was pulling thousands of observers out of the romanian presidential election after being submerged by an avalanche of fraud allegations . with nearly half of the votes counted after the first round of the election , the pro democracia rights organization said it was pulling its observers out of the second round because of the " numerous frauds " recorded in the first .

" i call publicly on mr nastase to ensure the count is correct , " he said in an interview on private realitatea television .
ioan onisei , a senior official in romania 's liberal-democrat alliance , told reuters news agency that the representatives on election committees across the country " have alerted the police about cases of fraud . "
in the run-up to the election some analysts and western diplomats expressed concern the ruling party may use its clout to tip the close contest .
previous elections deemed fair in terms of their political positions , the 54-year-old nastase would likely continue the politics of his predecessor , iliescu , wherease the 53-year-old basescu and mayor of bucharest is seen as representing a new direction .
the opposition candidate has urged voters to " rid romania of the mafia-like , corrupt system which has governed it over the past four years " and promised he would " work day and night to improve the lives of 22 million romanians " if elected .

other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity . " but others argued the law was still limiting research possibilities and swiss scientists risked falling behind their european counterparts when it comes to making medical breakthroughs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german researcher with imported stem cells " it 's a very restrictive law but it allows us to continue our work , " yvan arsenijevic , a scientist specialized in adult stem cells at the jules gonin hospital in lausanne , told reuters news agency .
" we , the scientists , were the ones who were seeking to have this restrictive law in place because there are potentially huge ethical problems with research on stem cells . " strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say . " under the law , all research projects must be passed by ethical and science committees , while the use of specially-produced embryos for research , or any cloning to produce embryos , is forbidden in an attempt to counter abuse . different laws elsewhere in europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human cell and ovum with nucleus removed researchers will be allowed to use excess stocks of embryos produced naturally for artificial insemination as a source for stem cells , the government said .
denmark , france , the netherlands and spain have adopted similar laws while germany and austria are much more restrictive , only allowing research on imported cells . more liberal regulations have been adopted in belgium and britain , where legislators in august gave the go ahead for human cloning , granting a licence to scientists to create stem cells for medical research from a cloned human embryo . couples whose embryos are stocked for research purposes also have a right to veto their use under the swiss law . scientists vow to abide by law stem cell research is denounced by conservative and religious groups in many countries , which argue that scientists are destroying human life in the course of their experiments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists demonstrate against cloning at a berlin hotel in 2003 " we believe that some unscrupulous researchers will be tempted to do human cloning , while the pharmaceutical industry will also be tempted to produce embryos purely for research purposes , " said maximilien bernhard , of the small federal democratic union party . karl heinz krause , a researcher on ageing at geneva university , said swiss scientists , who had put research on hold while the referendum was decided , would abide strictly by the law . " if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

other european countries have adopted more liberal laws . some 66.4 percent voted in favor of the law and 33.6 percent opposed it , according to national results . the referendum challenging the medical research law adopted by the swiss parliament in 2003 was launched by anti-abortion and religious groups , which oppose the principle of using " living " human embryos . " the law on stem cells withdraws the right to life from living , defenceless humans , " said antoine suarez , an opponent from a bioethics group .
" this kind of idea always leads to the destruction of humanity .

" strict limits the swiss government had urged voters to accept the law , saying it set " clear and strict " limits on the use of embryos and stem cells compared to other countries and brought the hope of cures for heart ailments , paralysis and parkinson 's disease . " in view of the suffering caused by these serious and today incurable illnesses , it would be misguided to prevent such research in switzerland , " the federal council told voters .
" research on stem cells is not synonymous with cloning , contrary to what some opponents of the law say .

" if we are to have results in a reasonable delay we need stem cell research from embryos and i think this message was heard by voters , " krause told swiss television . a regional breakdown of the results in switzerland showed that stem cell research was even approved by clear majorities in rural , more devout cantons that had been expected to oppose the law . switzerland is also the home of several major pharmaceutical multinationals and biotechnology companies and the government had argued that the swiss industry would suffer if there was a complete block on stem cell research . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's ethics council rejects cloning the national ethics council in germany announced on monday that it would continue to oppose the cloning of human embryos for research despite calls for more research into its benefits .

a boost in sunday shopping seems to be the cause . " very satisfactory " is how hubertus pellengahr , a spokesman for the german retailers association , described the start of this year 's christmas shopping season , which officially opened over the weekend .
adding to the thus-far positive outcome is the growth of a recent trend in germany : sunday shopping .
traditionally , shopping on sundays was tightly regulated and prohibitted except in a few rare cases .
now , however , an increasing number of stores are opening their doors on the day of rest .
shopping spark many simply allow shoppers through their doors to browse for what they might wish to buy on another day of the week .
the swedish furniture chain ikea , for example , has advertised with the " look only " principle in the hopes that customers will turn out on sundays when they have the time and come back to spend money during the work week . car dealerships have started operating on the same notion that comparison buyers want more time before they fork over the money .
but increasing numbers of stores have also opened for full-fledged consumption . retailers in berlin , dresden , potsdam and bonn , among other cities , have begun opening on sundays in an attempt to boast the shopping spirit before the end of the year .
the community council in each of the cities allows for four sunday shopping days per year , as long as none of them are in december .

a brighter season bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : weihnachtsmarkt in weimar despite the positive christmas season outlook , however , the retailers were sticking to their full-year prognosis for an overall decrease in sales of 0.5 percent .
their hope is that strong christmas sales will make up for extreme weakness in the october figures , which were down between 1.1 and 1.2 percent from last year .
over the weekend , sales increases were seen in many areas compared to last year , but above all in the purchase of decorative christmas items , the association said .
" the mood in the retail branch is lightening up , " pellengahr said .
" germans seem to have gotten in the mood for buying just in time for christmas . "
compensation for october according to association polls , the increase in demand began in the middle of november .
the industry even hopes to move the entire sales volume into the black by the end of november .
in addition , this year 's shopping season is longer than last year 's by two full selling days , pellengahr noted .
according to the research firm infratest-dimap , almost half of those asked said they had less money for christmas gifts this year than they did in 2003 .
some 47 percent said they had the same amount , while 8 percent said they had more .

shopping spark many simply allow shoppers through their doors to browse for what they might wish to buy on another day of the week .
the swedish furniture chain ikea , for example , has advertised with the " look only " principle in the hopes that customers will turn out on sundays when they have the time and come back to spend money during the work week . car dealerships have started operating on the same notion that comparison buyers want more time before they fork over the money .

they will scrap tariffs between them by 2007 , three years earlier than planned , malaysian leader abdullah ahmad badawi said at an asean summit in laos .
the other four states that make up asean will follow in 2012 .
the nations involved hope the move will improve their economic situation in the face of increasing competition from china , analysts say .
asean member countries free trade zone from 2007 brunei indonesia malaysia philippines singapore thailand joining in 2012 burma cambodia laos vietnam the 10 leaders are holding their annual summit in the laotian capital vientiane , where they are joined by representatives of china , india , japan , south korea , australia and new zealand .
over half the world population is represented at the two-day gathering .
security and the situation in burma are also high on the agenda at the summit .
' bad elements ' the us government warned last month that it had information of possible attacks on the asean forum .
laos state-run radio said last week that " bad elements " might plot trouble .
in addition to tightening security , lao authorities hope the meeting will give them a chance to showcase the country 's tourism potential .
in pictures : asean in laos the agenda includes a free trade accord between south east asia and china , and an anti-terrorism pact between asean and japan .
momentum is also reportedly building for participants to break with asean 's tradition of non-interference in other members ' internal affairs , and press burma to introduce democracy .
burma has recently appointed a new prime minister , who is thought to be even more hardline than his predecessor .
burma has released several political prisoners , including former student leader min ko naing , in what is being seen as an attempt to stem criticism at the forum .
security is tight , with manned checkpoints blocking people from entering the capital from the rural and mountainous provinces .
tourists have been told to stay away , after officials said the capital did not have enough hotel rooms .
laos is the victim of sporadic bomb attacks , which the authorities usually blame on " bad elements " .
this is often a reference to the ethnic hmong people , who fought alongside the us during the vietnam war , and say they have suffered discrimination in laos ever since .

debtcred , a national drive to tackle the dangers of borrowing , is being piloted at ashington high school .
organisers say debt is a massive problem and it is important to show teenagers how to live within their means when they leave school .
barclays bank has supported the pilot scheme initiated by the county council .
' literacy pack ' northumberland community safety coordinator stuart douglass said : " one of the problems is that people do n't realise the extent of their spending until they are already way out of their depth .
" this has led some young people to desperate measures , like loan sharks or illegal activities .
" we have had a great deal of interest from schools across the county and will be training key agencies who work with people so that the initiative can roll out across the county . "
the initiative is being launched by the high sheriff of northumberland , susan burnell , who said it will hopefully prevent young people from falling into problems with high interest rates .
she added : " i am delighted that this scheme is being extended in northumberland .
in partnership with the county council i hope to secure funding for a financial literacy pack for all school leavers .
" the pressure on young people to be consumers is great , especially when credit is so easily available . "

an organisation set up by prince charles is holding a conference in the county on monday to discuss ways to alleviate the problems .
described as a " hot spot " , the county has been chosen as the first place for the affordable rural housing initiative to share ideas .
the group will look at fresh ways of making affordable housing available .
prince charles believes the initiative can bring private and public bodies together to share new ideas .
