troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .

national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel for bulldozing homes in gaza in response to the killing of 13 israeli soldiers last week .
rice held talks with palstinian pm qureia in berlin on monday . u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel at a monday meeting in berlin with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia for its mass demolition plan in a gaza refugee camp . saeb erekat , palestinian cabinet minister and a member of qureia 's delegation said that qureia had urged immediate action to stop israel 's demolition of palestinian homes in the gaza strip even as israeli tanks cut off the rafah refugee camp from the rest of the gaza strip on monday prompting palestinians to flee their homes . " we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .
" -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- said they have contacted the israelis on the rafah demolitions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice rice 's meeting with qureia aimed to emphasize the bush administration 's backing for palestinian statehood , while pressing for palestinian reforms .
it was also attempt to regain support among palestinian that was lost when bush supported israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's one-time plan to pull out of gaza while leaving settlements in the west bank . palestinian delegates said they had asked for action to stop the destruction of palestinian homes , saying they received a pledge that " the americans will act now to stop what is going on in rafah , " palestinian foreign minister nabil shaath told ap . rice did not confirm that remark to reporters , but said the u.s. had repeatedly raised concerns that the destruction of palestinian homes in the area was " not conducive to peace . " " we understand the need for israel to defend itself , " she said .
" but we also recognize that israel is going to have to live next door to the palestinians . " erekat also confirmed to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- that the u.s. had committed itself to the creation of a palestinian state . " rice reiterated that they are committed to the two-state solution and that -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor . " it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 . " we have known for a long time , particularly in the run-up to june 30 , that there were going to be people who would try to derail the political process and the political transition , " she said .
" you have to keep the political transition on track . " " it is clearly time for the occupation to end , " she said .
" it is clearly time for the iraqis to be in control of their own political future . "
salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition . " we have to help -lrb- iraqis -rrb- provide security until they can provide it for themselves , " rice told reporters . handover to iraqis on track one day earlier , rice had stressed that the planned handover of power to an iraqi administration was on track . " it is absolutely critical that we keep our word to the iraqi people that on june 30 they will receive sovereignty , " she told political talk show host sabine christiansen in an interview for ard television .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be . " but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .
" we 'll stay until the job is done .
we 're not at the point where we want to be . " praise for german role in middle east on monday , the palestinian representative in berlin , abdallah franghi welcomed germany 's mediatory role in the middle east . in a radio interview , franghi said the germans had played a very important role as a catalyst .
" the fact that the meeting -lrb- between rice and qureia -rrb- is taking place in berlin is no coincidence , " he said .
" germany supports the peace process in the middle east and i believe , that the germans can do a lot in this respect , " franghi added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in recent years , german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , in particular , has regularly traveled to the region to meet with palestinian and israeli leaders and urge them to the negotiating table . even within the eu , germany has consistently stuck to its line of a separate state for the palestinians as the only way to bring lasting peace to the middle east .
even washington 's recent about-face to endorse israeli prime minister sharon 's unilateral plan to withdraw from gaza while retaining parts of the occupied west bank sparked criticism within germany . during a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak last month , chancellor schröder said , " the palestinians have the right to expect that decisions will not be made over their heads .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2004 eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern has a demanding month ahead of him the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december . during a two-day meeting , eu foreign ministers will be doing their best to solve the many outstanding problems plaguing the constitution blueprint before it 's finalized next month . one key sticking point is the new voting system .
clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .
no decisions are expected to be taken in brussels this week , but the meeting will give some indication of whether or not differences on the constitution details will be able to be resolved over the next month . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .

ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .

it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .
no decisions are expected to be taken in brussels this week , but the meeting will give some indication of whether or not differences on the constitution details will be able to be resolved over the next month . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .
banks pitched in the remaining of the € 3.2 billion that rescued the firm .
the deal still has n't been approved by brussels , which opposes state intervention in business transactions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen mary 2 was built at the alstom shipyard in saint-nazaire in 2003 , the company reported turnover of € 21.3 billion and € 1.4 billion in losses .
this year its losses have increased to € 5 billion and growing .
time is running out for alstom , too , since the initial rescue package expires in september . whatever happens in brussels monday , sarkozy and french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin are due to travel to berlin in late may to talk to german chancellor gerhard schröder and cabinet members about industrial cooperation , which the two countries aim to intensify . chirac stands apart berlin and paris are still patching up relations after the french government got involved in takeover negotiations between pharmaceutical companies sanofi , aventis , and novartis .
it threatened to veto the swiss company , novartis , and pushed for the fusion between france 's sanofi and the franco-german concern , aventis .
berlin criticized france 's " interventionist tactics . " but on thursday , at a franco-german summit meeting in berlin , president jacques chirac indirectly apologized for the tensions and distanced himself from the issue of alstom . " it 's not up to me to prejudge the situation , " chirac said .

rice held talks with palstinian pm qureia in berlin on monday . u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel at a monday meeting in berlin with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia for its mass demolition plan in a gaza refugee camp . saeb erekat , palestinian cabinet minister and a member of qureia 's delegation said that qureia had urged immediate action to stop israel 's demolition of palestinian homes in the gaza strip even as israeli tanks cut off the rafah refugee camp from the rest of the gaza strip on monday prompting palestinians to flee their homes . " we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .

" " we understand the need for israel to defend itself , " she said .
" but we also recognize that israel is going to have to live next door to the palestinians . " erekat also confirmed to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- that the u.s. had committed itself to the creation of a palestinian state . " rice reiterated that they are committed to the two-state solution and that -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor . " it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 . " we have known for a long time , particularly in the run-up to june 30 , that there were going to be people who would try to derail the political process and the political transition , " she said .
" you have to keep the political transition on track . " " it is clearly time for the occupation to end , " she said .
" it is clearly time for the iraqis to be in control of their own political future . "
salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition .

" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be . " but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2004 eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern has a demanding month ahead of him the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december . during a two-day meeting , eu foreign ministers will be doing their best to solve the many outstanding problems plaguing the constitution blueprint before it 's finalized next month . one key sticking point is the new voting system .
clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .
no decisions are expected to be taken in brussels this week , but the meeting will give some indication of whether or not differences on the constitution details will be able to be resolved over the next month . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .

" but we also recognize that israel is going to have to live next door to the palestinians .

he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor . " it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 . " we have known for a long time , particularly in the run-up to june 30 , that there were going to be people who would try to derail the political process and the political transition , " she said .
" you have to keep the political transition on track . " " it is clearly time for the occupation to end , " she said .
" it is clearly time for the iraqis to be in control of their own political future . "
salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .
banks pitched in the remaining of the € 3.2 billion that rescued the firm .
the deal still has n't been approved by brussels , which opposes state intervention in business transactions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen mary 2 was built at the alstom shipyard in saint-nazaire in 2003 , the company reported turnover of € 21.3 billion and € 1.4 billion in losses .
this year its losses have increased to € 5 billion and growing .
time is running out for alstom , too , since the initial rescue package expires in september . whatever happens in brussels monday , sarkozy and french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin are due to travel to berlin in late may to talk to german chancellor gerhard schröder and cabinet members about industrial cooperation , which the two countries aim to intensify . chirac stands apart berlin and paris are still patching up relations after the french government got involved in takeover negotiations between pharmaceutical companies sanofi , aventis , and novartis .
it threatened to veto the swiss company , novartis , and pushed for the fusion between france 's sanofi and the franco-german concern , aventis .
berlin criticized france 's " interventionist tactics . " but on thursday , at a franco-german summit meeting in berlin , president jacques chirac indirectly apologized for the tensions and distanced himself from the issue of alstom . " it 's not up to me to prejudge the situation , " chirac said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2004 eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern has a demanding month ahead of him the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december . during a two-day meeting , eu foreign ministers will be doing their best to solve the many outstanding problems plaguing the constitution blueprint before it 's finalized next month . one key sticking point is the new voting system .
clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .
no decisions are expected to be taken in brussels this week , but the meeting will give some indication of whether or not differences on the constitution details will be able to be resolved over the next month . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .
banks pitched in the remaining of the € 3.2 billion that rescued the firm .
the deal still has n't been approved by brussels , which opposes state intervention in business transactions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen mary 2 was built at the alstom shipyard in saint-nazaire in 2003 , the company reported turnover of € 21.3 billion and € 1.4 billion in losses .

national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel for bulldozing homes in gaza in response to the killing of 13 israeli soldiers last week .
rice held talks with palstinian pm qureia in berlin on monday . u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel at a monday meeting in berlin with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia for its mass demolition plan in a gaza refugee camp . saeb erekat , palestinian cabinet minister and a member of qureia 's delegation said that qureia had urged immediate action to stop israel 's demolition of palestinian homes in the gaza strip even as israeli tanks cut off the rafah refugee camp from the rest of the gaza strip on monday prompting palestinians to flee their homes . " we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .
" -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- said they have contacted the israelis on the rafah demolitions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice rice 's meeting with qureia aimed to emphasize the bush administration 's backing for palestinian statehood , while pressing for palestinian reforms .
it was also attempt to regain support among palestinian that was lost when bush supported israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's one-time plan to pull out of gaza while leaving settlements in the west bank . palestinian delegates said they had asked for action to stop the destruction of palestinian homes , saying they received a pledge that " the americans will act now to stop what is going on in rafah , " palestinian foreign minister nabil shaath told ap . rice did not confirm that remark to reporters , but said the u.s. had repeatedly raised concerns that the destruction of palestinian homes in the area was " not conducive to peace . " " we understand the need for israel to defend itself , " she said .
" but we also recognize that israel is going to have to live next door to the palestinians . " erekat also confirmed to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- that the u.s. had committed itself to the creation of a palestinian state . " rice reiterated that they are committed to the two-state solution and that -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor . " it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 . " we have known for a long time , particularly in the run-up to june 30 , that there were going to be people who would try to derail the political process and the political transition , " she said .
" you have to keep the political transition on track . " " it is clearly time for the occupation to end , " she said .
" it is clearly time for the iraqis to be in control of their own political future . "

" we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .
" -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- said they have contacted the israelis on the rafah demolitions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice rice 's meeting with qureia aimed to emphasize the bush administration 's backing for palestinian statehood , while pressing for palestinian reforms .

" " we understand the need for israel to defend itself , " she said .
" but we also recognize that israel is going to have to live next door to the palestinians . " erekat also confirmed to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- that the u.s. had committed itself to the creation of a palestinian state . " rice reiterated that they are committed to the two-state solution and that -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor . " it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 . " we have known for a long time , particularly in the run-up to june 30 , that there were going to be people who would try to derail the political process and the political transition , " she said .
" you have to keep the political transition on track . " " it is clearly time for the occupation to end , " she said .
" it is clearly time for the iraqis to be in control of their own political future . "
salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition .

" it is absolutely critical that we keep our word to the iraqi people that on june 30 they will receive sovereignty , " she told political talk show host sabine christiansen in an interview for ard television .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be . " but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .

clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .

the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .

clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.05.2004 all or nothing for alstom ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alstom ceo patrick kron ca n't prevent the break-up of the french conglomerate .
troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .
banks pitched in the remaining of the € 3.2 billion that rescued the firm .
the deal still has n't been approved by brussels , which opposes state intervention in business transactions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen mary 2 was built at the alstom shipyard in saint-nazaire in 2003 , the company reported turnover of € 21.3 billion and € 1.4 billion in losses .
this year its losses have increased to € 5 billion and growing .
time is running out for alstom , too , since the initial rescue package expires in september . whatever happens in brussels monday , sarkozy and french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin are due to travel to berlin in late may to talk to german chancellor gerhard schröder and cabinet members about industrial cooperation , which the two countries aim to intensify . chirac stands apart berlin and paris are still patching up relations after the french government got involved in takeover negotiations between pharmaceutical companies sanofi , aventis , and novartis .
it threatened to veto the swiss company , novartis , and pushed for the fusion between france 's sanofi and the franco-german concern , aventis .
berlin criticized france 's " interventionist tactics . " but on thursday , at a franco-german summit meeting in berlin , president jacques chirac indirectly apologized for the tensions and distanced himself from the issue of alstom . " it 's not up to me to prejudge the situation , " chirac said .
" this is about private companies and it 's not our job , neither the french nor the german government , to impose a point of view or a solution . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france , germany plan tighter industrial ties in a regular summit meeting in paris , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder discussed industrial ties , the euro stability pact and condemned this week 's grisly in iraq .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .
banks pitched in the remaining of the € 3.2 billion that rescued the firm .

this year its losses have increased to € 5 billion and growing .
time is running out for alstom , too , since the initial rescue package expires in september . whatever happens in brussels monday , sarkozy and french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin are due to travel to berlin in late may to talk to german chancellor gerhard schröder and cabinet members about industrial cooperation , which the two countries aim to intensify . chirac stands apart berlin and paris are still patching up relations after the french government got involved in takeover negotiations between pharmaceutical companies sanofi , aventis , and novartis .
it threatened to veto the swiss company , novartis , and pushed for the fusion between france 's sanofi and the franco-german concern , aventis .
berlin criticized france 's " interventionist tactics . " but on thursday , at a franco-german summit meeting in berlin , president jacques chirac indirectly apologized for the tensions and distanced himself from the issue of alstom . " it 's not up to me to prejudge the situation , " chirac said .

although the new position is not foreseen until 2009 when the new institutional changes for the european commission are scheduled to come into force , ways are being examined to introduce the post of eu foreign minister during the next commission term , which begins in november .
referring to the difficulties involved with introducing the post earlier , a commission official remarked that " certainly there are some people who would like it to be possible . "
according to media reports , the eu 's high representative javier solana is said to be pushing to get the job and to have it introduced early .
he is allegedly set to raise the issue at a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday in brussels .
this will have big political and legal repercussions for other elements of the constitution , which are also up for discussion .
the new foreign minister post would combine the diplomatic role of solana with external relations commissioner chris patten , who implements the eu 's aid programs .
in addition , the office would serve as vice-president of the european commission and chair of the foreign affairs council .
the new eu foreign minister would be the single representative for the eu in foreign affairs - in contrast to today , where solana is also flanked by the foreign ministers of the country holding the rotating six-month presidency .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .
banks pitched in the remaining of the € 3.2 billion that rescued the firm .
the deal still has n't been approved by brussels , which opposes state intervention in business transactions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen mary 2 was built at the alstom shipyard in saint-nazaire in 2003 , the company reported turnover of € 21.3 billion and € 1.4 billion in losses .

time is running out for alstom , too , since the initial rescue package expires in september . whatever happens in brussels monday , sarkozy and french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin are due to travel to berlin in late may to talk to german chancellor gerhard schröder and cabinet members about industrial cooperation , which the two countries aim to intensify . chirac stands apart berlin and paris are still patching up relations after the french government got involved in takeover negotiations between pharmaceutical companies sanofi , aventis , and novartis .
it threatened to veto the swiss company , novartis , and pushed for the fusion between france 's sanofi and the franco-german concern , aventis .
berlin criticized france 's " interventionist tactics . " but on thursday , at a franco-german summit meeting in berlin , president jacques chirac indirectly apologized for the tensions and distanced himself from the issue of alstom . " it 's not up to me to prejudge the situation , " chirac said .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .
banks pitched in the remaining of the € 3.2 billion that rescued the firm .
the deal still has n't been approved by brussels , which opposes state intervention in business transactions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen mary 2 was built at the alstom shipyard in saint-nazaire in 2003 , the company reported turnover of € 21.3 billion and € 1.4 billion in losses .
this year its losses have increased to € 5 billion and growing .
time is running out for alstom , too , since the initial rescue package expires in september . whatever happens in brussels monday , sarkozy and french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin are due to travel to berlin in late may to talk to german chancellor gerhard schröder and cabinet members about industrial cooperation , which the two countries aim to intensify . chirac stands apart berlin and paris are still patching up relations after the french government got involved in takeover negotiations between pharmaceutical companies sanofi , aventis , and novartis .
it threatened to veto the swiss company , novartis , and pushed for the fusion between france 's sanofi and the franco-german concern , aventis .

the report also indicates that the number of politically motivated crimes was down six percent in 2003 and that there were 1,743 crimes committed by foreigners in 2003 , up from 845 the previous year .
the increase was mainly due to the investigations surrounding the islamic caliphate organization in cologne . dw-world.de foreign extremist population shrinking in germany the number of foreign religious extremists active in germany fell slightly in 2002 , according to a government report .
the data provides anecdotal evidence that new domestic security measures are working .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc an early introduction for eu foreign minister post ?
although the new position is not foreseen until 2009 when the new institutional changes for the european commission are scheduled to come into force , ways are being examined to introduce the post of eu foreign minister during the next commission term , which begins in november .
referring to the difficulties involved with introducing the post earlier , a commission official remarked that " certainly there are some people who would like it to be possible . "
according to media reports , the eu 's high representative javier solana is said to be pushing to get the job and to have it introduced early .
he is allegedly set to raise the issue at a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday in brussels .
this will have big political and legal repercussions for other elements of the constitution , which are also up for discussion .
the new foreign minister post would combine the diplomatic role of solana with external relations commissioner chris patten , who implements the eu 's aid programs .
in addition , the office would serve as vice-president of the european commission and chair of the foreign affairs council .
the new eu foreign minister would be the single representative for the eu in foreign affairs - in contrast to today , where solana is also flanked by the foreign ministers of the country holding the rotating six-month presidency .

clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .

both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .

clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .

ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .
no decisions are expected to be taken in brussels this week , but the meeting will give some indication of whether or not differences on the constitution details will be able to be resolved over the next month . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .

although the new position is not foreseen until 2009 when the new institutional changes for the european commission are scheduled to come into force , ways are being examined to introduce the post of eu foreign minister during the next commission term , which begins in november .
referring to the difficulties involved with introducing the post earlier , a commission official remarked that " certainly there are some people who would like it to be possible . "
according to media reports , the eu 's high representative javier solana is said to be pushing to get the job and to have it introduced early .
he is allegedly set to raise the issue at a meeting of eu foreign ministers on monday in brussels .
this will have big political and legal repercussions for other elements of the constitution , which are also up for discussion .
the new foreign minister post would combine the diplomatic role of solana with external relations commissioner chris patten , who implements the eu 's aid programs .
in addition , the office would serve as vice-president of the european commission and chair of the foreign affairs council .
the new eu foreign minister would be the single representative for the eu in foreign affairs - in contrast to today , where solana is also flanked by the foreign ministers of the country holding the rotating six-month presidency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2004 eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern has a demanding month ahead of him the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december . during a two-day meeting , eu foreign ministers will be doing their best to solve the many outstanding problems plaguing the constitution blueprint before it 's finalized next month . one key sticking point is the new voting system .
clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .
no decisions are expected to be taken in brussels this week , but the meeting will give some indication of whether or not differences on the constitution details will be able to be resolved over the next month . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2004 eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern has a demanding month ahead of him the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december . during a two-day meeting , eu foreign ministers will be doing their best to solve the many outstanding problems plaguing the constitution blueprint before it 's finalized next month . one key sticking point is the new voting system .
clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .
no decisions are expected to be taken in brussels this week , but the meeting will give some indication of whether or not differences on the constitution details will be able to be resolved over the next month . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .

clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .

clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .
banks pitched in the remaining of the € 3.2 billion that rescued the firm .
the deal still has n't been approved by brussels , which opposes state intervention in business transactions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen mary 2 was built at the alstom shipyard in saint-nazaire in 2003 , the company reported turnover of € 21.3 billion and € 1.4 billion in losses .

national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel for bulldozing homes in gaza in response to the killing of 13 israeli soldiers last week .
rice held talks with palstinian pm qureia in berlin on monday . u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel at a monday meeting in berlin with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia for its mass demolition plan in a gaza refugee camp . saeb erekat , palestinian cabinet minister and a member of qureia 's delegation said that qureia had urged immediate action to stop israel 's demolition of palestinian homes in the gaza strip even as israeli tanks cut off the rafah refugee camp from the rest of the gaza strip on monday prompting palestinians to flee their homes . " we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .

salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2004 eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern has a demanding month ahead of him the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december . during a two-day meeting , eu foreign ministers will be doing their best to solve the many outstanding problems plaguing the constitution blueprint before it 's finalized next month . one key sticking point is the new voting system .
clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .

clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .

this year its losses have increased to € 5 billion and growing .
time is running out for alstom , too , since the initial rescue package expires in september . whatever happens in brussels monday , sarkozy and french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin are due to travel to berlin in late may to talk to german chancellor gerhard schröder and cabinet members about industrial cooperation , which the two countries aim to intensify . chirac stands apart berlin and paris are still patching up relations after the french government got involved in takeover negotiations between pharmaceutical companies sanofi , aventis , and novartis .
it threatened to veto the swiss company , novartis , and pushed for the fusion between france 's sanofi and the franco-german concern , aventis .
berlin criticized france 's " interventionist tactics . " but on thursday , at a franco-german summit meeting in berlin , president jacques chirac indirectly apologized for the tensions and distanced himself from the issue of alstom . " it 's not up to me to prejudge the situation , " chirac said .

" we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .
" -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- said they have contacted the israelis on the rafah demolitions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice rice 's meeting with qureia aimed to emphasize the bush administration 's backing for palestinian statehood , while pressing for palestinian reforms .

" " we understand the need for israel to defend itself , " she said .
" but we also recognize that israel is going to have to live next door to the palestinians . " erekat also confirmed to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- that the u.s. had committed itself to the creation of a palestinian state . " rice reiterated that they are committed to the two-state solution and that -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor . " it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 .

" you have to keep the political transition on track . " " it is clearly time for the occupation to end , " she said .
" it is clearly time for the iraqis to be in control of their own political future . "
salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition .

" it is absolutely critical that we keep our word to the iraqi people that on june 30 they will receive sovereignty , " she told political talk show host sabine christiansen in an interview for ard television .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be . " but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .
" we 'll stay until the job is done .
we 're not at the point where we want to be . " praise for german role in middle east on monday , the palestinian representative in berlin , abdallah franghi welcomed germany 's mediatory role in the middle east . in a radio interview , franghi said the germans had played a very important role as a catalyst .
" the fact that the meeting -lrb- between rice and qureia -rrb- is taking place in berlin is no coincidence , " he said .
" germany supports the peace process in the middle east and i believe , that the germans can do a lot in this respect , " franghi added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in recent years , german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , in particular , has regularly traveled to the region to meet with palestinian and israeli leaders and urge them to the negotiating table . even within the eu , germany has consistently stuck to its line of a separate state for the palestinians as the only way to bring lasting peace to the middle east .
even washington 's recent about-face to endorse israeli prime minister sharon 's unilateral plan to withdraw from gaza while retaining parts of the occupied west bank sparked criticism within germany . during a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak last month , chancellor schröder said , " the palestinians have the right to expect that decisions will not be made over their heads .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.05.2004 eu foreign ministers hope for breakthrough on constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier bertie ahern has a demanding month ahead of him the european constitution tops the agenda when eu foreign ministers meet in brussels monday to revive negotiations for the first time since talks collapsed last december . during a two-day meeting , eu foreign ministers will be doing their best to solve the many outstanding problems plaguing the constitution blueprint before it 's finalized next month . one key sticking point is the new voting system .
clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .

bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive .

" we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .
" -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- said they have contacted the israelis on the rafah demolitions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice rice 's meeting with qureia aimed to emphasize the bush administration 's backing for palestinian statehood , while pressing for palestinian reforms .
it was also attempt to regain support among palestinian that was lost when bush supported israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's one-time plan to pull out of gaza while leaving settlements in the west bank . palestinian delegates said they had asked for action to stop the destruction of palestinian homes , saying they received a pledge that " the americans will act now to stop what is going on in rafah , " palestinian foreign minister nabil shaath told ap . rice did not confirm that remark to reporters , but said the u.s. had repeatedly raised concerns that the destruction of palestinian homes in the area was " not conducive to peace .

bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor .

salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition .

german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .
alstom has already sold its smaller divisions such as utilities and turbine production plants , and the larger divisions such as transport and nuclear power could be prize catches .
and neither the banks , bnp paribas and crédit agricole , nor areva back sarkozy 's solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an alstom subway car in new york city indeed , areva and siemens have jointly proposed an alternative plan to restructure alstom , with areva taking over the transport division , including the tgv high-speed train , and siemens acquiring the large energy division . going to the dinosaurs ? alstom has been an ailing industrial dinosaur for years .
its mixed portfolio of cross-the-board divisions mired it down , draining the profits of more successful ones .
disaster loomed in 2003 , until the french government , anxious to preserve the conglomerate , stepped in with € 800,000 in financial aid .
banks pitched in the remaining of the € 3.2 billion that rescued the firm .
the deal still has n't been approved by brussels , which opposes state intervention in business transactions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen mary 2 was built at the alstom shipyard in saint-nazaire in 2003 , the company reported turnover of € 21.3 billion and € 1.4 billion in losses .

he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive .

" it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 .

" we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .

national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel for bulldozing homes in gaza in response to the killing of 13 israeli soldiers last week .
rice held talks with palstinian pm qureia in berlin on monday . u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel at a monday meeting in berlin with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia for its mass demolition plan in a gaza refugee camp . saeb erekat , palestinian cabinet minister and a member of qureia 's delegation said that qureia had urged immediate action to stop israel 's demolition of palestinian homes in the gaza strip even as israeli tanks cut off the rafah refugee camp from the rest of the gaza strip on monday prompting palestinians to flee their homes . " we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .
" -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- said they have contacted the israelis on the rafah demolitions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice rice 's meeting with qureia aimed to emphasize the bush administration 's backing for palestinian statehood , while pressing for palestinian reforms .
it was also attempt to regain support among palestinian that was lost when bush supported israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's one-time plan to pull out of gaza while leaving settlements in the west bank . palestinian delegates said they had asked for action to stop the destruction of palestinian homes , saying they received a pledge that " the americans will act now to stop what is going on in rafah , " palestinian foreign minister nabil shaath told ap . rice did not confirm that remark to reporters , but said the u.s. had repeatedly raised concerns that the destruction of palestinian homes in the area was " not conducive to peace . " " we understand the need for israel to defend itself , " she said .
" but we also recognize that israel is going to have to live next door to the palestinians . " erekat also confirmed to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- that the u.s. had committed itself to the creation of a palestinian state . " rice reiterated that they are committed to the two-state solution and that -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor . " it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 . " we have known for a long time , particularly in the run-up to june 30 , that there were going to be people who would try to derail the political process and the political transition , " she said .
" you have to keep the political transition on track . " " it is clearly time for the occupation to end , " she said .
" it is clearly time for the iraqis to be in control of their own political future . "
salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition . " we have to help -lrb- iraqis -rrb- provide security until they can provide it for themselves , " rice told reporters . handover to iraqis on track one day earlier , rice had stressed that the planned handover of power to an iraqi administration was on track . " it is absolutely critical that we keep our word to the iraqi people that on june 30 they will receive sovereignty , " she told political talk show host sabine christiansen in an interview for ard television .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be . " but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .
" we 'll stay until the job is done .
we 're not at the point where we want to be . " praise for german role in middle east on monday , the palestinian representative in berlin , abdallah franghi welcomed germany 's mediatory role in the middle east . in a radio interview , franghi said the germans had played a very important role as a catalyst .
" the fact that the meeting -lrb- between rice and qureia -rrb- is taking place in berlin is no coincidence , " he said .
" germany supports the peace process in the middle east and i believe , that the germans can do a lot in this respect , " franghi added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in recent years , german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , in particular , has regularly traveled to the region to meet with palestinian and israeli leaders and urge them to the negotiating table . even within the eu , germany has consistently stuck to its line of a separate state for the palestinians as the only way to bring lasting peace to the middle east .
even washington 's recent about-face to endorse israeli prime minister sharon 's unilateral plan to withdraw from gaza while retaining parts of the occupied west bank sparked criticism within germany . during a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak last month , chancellor schröder said , " the palestinians have the right to expect that decisions will not be made over their heads .

clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .

both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .

national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel for bulldozing homes in gaza in response to the killing of 13 israeli soldiers last week .
rice held talks with palstinian pm qureia in berlin on monday . u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel at a monday meeting in berlin with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia for its mass demolition plan in a gaza refugee camp . saeb erekat , palestinian cabinet minister and a member of qureia 's delegation said that qureia had urged immediate action to stop israel 's demolition of palestinian homes in the gaza strip even as israeli tanks cut off the rafah refugee camp from the rest of the gaza strip on monday prompting palestinians to flee their homes . " we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .
" -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- said they have contacted the israelis on the rafah demolitions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice rice 's meeting with qureia aimed to emphasize the bush administration 's backing for palestinian statehood , while pressing for palestinian reforms .
it was also attempt to regain support among palestinian that was lost when bush supported israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's one-time plan to pull out of gaza while leaving settlements in the west bank . palestinian delegates said they had asked for action to stop the destruction of palestinian homes , saying they received a pledge that " the americans will act now to stop what is going on in rafah , " palestinian foreign minister nabil shaath told ap . rice did not confirm that remark to reporters , but said the u.s. had repeatedly raised concerns that the destruction of palestinian homes in the area was " not conducive to peace . " " we understand the need for israel to defend itself , " she said .
" but we also recognize that israel is going to have to live next door to the palestinians . " erekat also confirmed to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- that the u.s. had committed itself to the creation of a palestinian state . " rice reiterated that they are committed to the two-state solution and that -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor . " it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 . " we have known for a long time , particularly in the run-up to june 30 , that there were going to be people who would try to derail the political process and the political transition , " she said .
" you have to keep the political transition on track . " " it is clearly time for the occupation to end , " she said .
" it is clearly time for the iraqis to be in control of their own political future . "
salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition . " we have to help -lrb- iraqis -rrb- provide security until they can provide it for themselves , " rice told reporters . handover to iraqis on track one day earlier , rice had stressed that the planned handover of power to an iraqi administration was on track . " it is absolutely critical that we keep our word to the iraqi people that on june 30 they will receive sovereignty , " she told political talk show host sabine christiansen in an interview for ard television .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be . " but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .
" we 'll stay until the job is done .
we 're not at the point where we want to be . " praise for german role in middle east on monday , the palestinian representative in berlin , abdallah franghi welcomed germany 's mediatory role in the middle east . in a radio interview , franghi said the germans had played a very important role as a catalyst .
" the fact that the meeting -lrb- between rice and qureia -rrb- is taking place in berlin is no coincidence , " he said .
" germany supports the peace process in the middle east and i believe , that the germans can do a lot in this respect , " franghi added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in recent years , german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , in particular , has regularly traveled to the region to meet with palestinian and israeli leaders and urge them to the negotiating table . even within the eu , germany has consistently stuck to its line of a separate state for the palestinians as the only way to bring lasting peace to the middle east .
even washington 's recent about-face to endorse israeli prime minister sharon 's unilateral plan to withdraw from gaza while retaining parts of the occupied west bank sparked criticism within germany . during a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak last month , chancellor schröder said , " the palestinians have the right to expect that decisions will not be made over their heads .

clashes over this issue led to the breakdown in discussions late last year , with spain and poland objecting to the proposed distribution of voting rights . reaching consensus the two countries were keen to retain the system agreed in nice in 2000 which granted them voting rights disproportionate to their populations .
opposition from france and germany led to an abrupt and acrimonious end to the summit , and signature of the draft constitution was put on the backburner until the voting issue could be worked out . president of the european parliament pat cox told deutsche welle on monday " there 's still an appetite and a determination to find a settlement . "
he said now that europe is united , it is time to move forward for a consensus on the constitution , " to move from process to delivery and from design to content . " with ireland currently holding the rotating eu presidency , irish prime minister bertie ahern is shoring up support for a deal based on the " double majority " system proposed in the original draft from last year .
according to this , most decisions will be taken by a simple majority of member states which represent 60 percent of the eu population , as opposed to the previous system which favored smaller states by giving them a larger voting voice than their population justified .
ahern hopes the negotiations will go sufficiently smoothly to sign a deal at the summit he 'll be hosting in brussels on june 17 , shortly before the current irish eu presidency expires . a challenging month for ireland the weeks ahead will be tense ones for the irish presidency .
may saw ahern visiting european capitals in an attempt to iron out the problems in the current charter - apparently with some degree of success .
both spain , which has a new government , and poland have said the bloc is nearing consensus . the ministers are also expected to thrash out the controversial reshuffling of the european commission .
the irish presidency has suggested that from 2014 , the european commission be reduced to 18 members .
this would mean a country would lose its right to have a commissioner for one out of every three terms . other than this , ahern will be avoiding other major institutional proposals during the talks .
ahead of monday 's meeting , an irish spokesperson said dublin had " deliberately decided not to put in concrete new poposals as it is " the first relaunch at political level " of constitution talks . pushing for a new eu foreign minister behind the scenes , ministers will also be discussing an early introduction of the new eu foreign minister post - a position the eu 's high representative javier solana has his eye on .
it would combine his present role with that of the commissioner for external relations , a post currently held by chris patten , and would make him the eu 's sole representative in foreign affairs , dispensing with the support of the foreign ministers of the country holding the 6-month rotating presidency . as it stands , the eu foreign minister post is set to be introduced in 2009 , when the european commission 's instutional changes are implemented .
but there are moves afoot to see it come into force earlier , and solana is expected to raise the issue at today 's meeting . foreign policy concerns aside from the constitution , ministers will also be looking at foreign policy issues such as the middle east , iraq , the balkans , syria and libya . the eu is keen to improve its ties with tripoli , but relations are strained by the ongoing disagreement on compensation for victims of a berlin nightclub bombing masterminded by libya in 1986 . the main focus of the two-day event , however , will be on preparation of the agenda for the eu leaders ' summit in june .
no decisions are expected to be taken in brussels this week , but the meeting will give some indication of whether or not differences on the constitution details will be able to be resolved over the next month . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de libya and germany fail to agree on bomb compensation negotiations between libyan and german officials over compensation for the victims of a 1986 berlin bombing ended unsuccessfully in berlin on sunday .

troubled french engineering giant alstom could become a test case for european industrial policy .
german rival siemens has shown interest in bits and pieces , but french finance minister sarkozy says it 's all or nothing . nicolas sarkozy is set to meet eu competition commissioner mario monti in brussels monday to plead his case for rescuing the beleaguered french company alstom .
the french finance minister has long been opposed to selling off parts of the heavy engineering firm , but he 's been unable to reach an agreement with monti , who has rejected as unfair state aid to keep alstom afloat . " we 'll save alstom from being dismantled , " sarkozy said in an interview published monday in the parisian daily le figaro .
" do n't count on me to abandon it . " sarkozy fears that alstom wo n't survive otherwise .
he came up with a plan to sell off parts of alstom worth € 1.6 billion to appease the european commission and hopefully curry monti 's favor for a state-backed bail out heavily shouldered by french banks .
french state-controlled energy group areva would also be part of the deal and likely be expected to pump money into alstom . cards stacked against sarkozy but brussels reportedly prefers the idea of selling parts to areva or alstom 's main rival , germany 's siemens .

national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel for bulldozing homes in gaza in response to the killing of 13 israeli soldiers last week .
rice held talks with palstinian pm qureia in berlin on monday . u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice criticized israel at a monday meeting in berlin with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia for its mass demolition plan in a gaza refugee camp . saeb erekat , palestinian cabinet minister and a member of qureia 's delegation said that qureia had urged immediate action to stop israel 's demolition of palestinian homes in the gaza strip even as israeli tanks cut off the rafah refugee camp from the rest of the gaza strip on monday prompting palestinians to flee their homes . " we stressed the need to interfere immediately to stop the major catastrophe taking place in rafah , " erekat said .
" -lrb- the u.s. -rrb- said they have contacted the israelis on the rafah demolitions , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , u.s. national security advisor condoleezza rice rice 's meeting with qureia aimed to emphasize the bush administration 's backing for palestinian statehood , while pressing for palestinian reforms .
it was also attempt to regain support among palestinian that was lost when bush supported israeli prime minister ariel sharon 's one-time plan to pull out of gaza while leaving settlements in the west bank . palestinian delegates said they had asked for action to stop the destruction of palestinian homes , saying they received a pledge that " the americans will act now to stop what is going on in rafah , " palestinian foreign minister nabil shaath told ap . rice did not confirm that remark to reporters , but said the u.s. had repeatedly raised concerns that the destruction of palestinian homes in the area was " not conducive to peace . " " we understand the need for israel to defend itself , " she said .
" but we also recognize that israel is going to have to live next door to the palestinians . " erekat also confirmed to the associated press -lrb- ap -rrb- that the u.s. had committed itself to the creation of a palestinian state . " rice reiterated that they are committed to the two-state solution and that -lrb- george w. -rrb-
bush is the first president to commit to a palestinian state , " erekat said .
he described the meeting as " in-depth , constructive and positive . " u.s. officials said rice at the same time had urged greater progress on political and security reforms from the palestinians and stressed that washington views palestinian leader yasser arafat as a " negative and unhelpful " factor . " it 's extremely important at this point that the palestinians begin the hard work of building the institutions that will be the foundations for a palestinian state , " she said . attacks in iraq could get worse rice condemned the killing in baghdad of izzedin salim , the head of iraq 's governing council , by a suicide bomber , adding that it must not stand in the way of the transition to power to the iraqis on june 30 . " we have known for a long time , particularly in the run-up to june 30 , that there were going to be people who would try to derail the political process and the political transition , " she said .
" you have to keep the political transition on track . " " it is clearly time for the occupation to end , " she said .
" it is clearly time for the iraqis to be in control of their own political future . "
salim , a moderate shi 'ite and newspaper editor , was one of six people killed by a bomb that blew up at a checkpoint as he was waiting in a convoy to get into the coalition headquarters . rice said such attacks could worsen in the weeks leading up to june 30 as insurgents try to derail the political transition . " we have to help -lrb- iraqis -rrb- provide security until they can provide it for themselves , " rice told reporters . handover to iraqis on track one day earlier , rice had stressed that the planned handover of power to an iraqi administration was on track . " it is absolutely critical that we keep our word to the iraqi people that on june 30 they will receive sovereignty , " she told political talk show host sabine christiansen in an interview for ard television .
" they will be fully sovereign in making their own decisions , and that is how it should be . " but she added that u.s. forces would not withdraw from iraq until the situation in the country had been stabilized .
" we 'll stay until the job is done .
we 're not at the point where we want to be . " praise for german role in middle east on monday , the palestinian representative in berlin , abdallah franghi welcomed germany 's mediatory role in the middle east . in a radio interview , franghi said the germans had played a very important role as a catalyst .
" the fact that the meeting -lrb- between rice and qureia -rrb- is taking place in berlin is no coincidence , " he said .
" germany supports the peace process in the middle east and i believe , that the germans can do a lot in this respect , " franghi added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer in recent years , german foreign minister joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- , in particular , has regularly traveled to the region to meet with palestinian and israeli leaders and urge them to the negotiating table . even within the eu , germany has consistently stuck to its line of a separate state for the palestinians as the only way to bring lasting peace to the middle east .
even washington 's recent about-face to endorse israeli prime minister sharon 's unilateral plan to withdraw from gaza while retaining parts of the occupied west bank sparked criticism within germany . during a meeting with egyptian president hosni mubarak last month , chancellor schröder said , " the palestinians have the right to expect that decisions will not be made over their heads .

as many as 230 jobs are promised in the short term in ceredigion , with the welsh development agency saying 1,000 jobs could be created in 20 years .
the £ 21m investment aims to turn parc aberporth into a centre of excellence for developing the planes .
work began on monday on creating a 50-acre high-tech centre for aerospace firms .
the planes , known as unmanned aerial vehicles -lrb- uavs -rrb- , are part of an industry already estimated to be worth £ 1bn .
their cameras and radar are used to gather intelligence during warfare or routine espionage without risking the lives of pilots .
nato has also used them recently in kosovo as tank-busters .
before the war in iraq , america accused saddam hussein of having developed uavs with a range so great that they could attack american targets .
us secretary of state colin powell also said iraq had uavs which could dispense chemical and biological weapons , one of which had flown 500km .
but the civilian potential of the planes is also massive .
as well as keeping an eye on the roads , they could check the coasts for drug runners or illegal fishing , for instance .
pre-war , the us said iraq used uavs like this with a 500km range aberporth is also home to a ministry of defence missile-testing range , and it is hoped that local skills will help attract business .
the welsh development agency -lrb- wda -rrb- is optimistic that the site could support to 1,000 jobs .
alex bricknall from the wda told bbc wales the project would see a wide variety of sophisticated systems being developed on site .
" we are talking about a range of applications , from maritime surveillance through to defence applications - things like targets for missile systems , " he said .
the project is receiving funding from european objective one funds and the welsh assembly government .
alan lewis , assistant director for economic development for ceredigion council , said the benefits could be considerable .
" it will make a major impact , " he said . "
over the last 18 months we have seen the loss of over 500 jobs from the cardigan area , and this particular site has been a sleeping giant in the eyes of the county council , and we are now beginning to see it waking up once again .
" the 230 jobs to be created in the first phase will be high value jobs that will provide an opportunity for training education and career development - not just for inward investment companies and their staff , but also for residents of this county . "
economic development minister andrew davies said : " today is a red letter day for west wales .
with the closure recently of factories , including dewhirst , hundreds of jobs were lost .
" we are confident that parc aberporth , as part of the south ceredigion regeneration package , will bring high-quality jobs to this area . "

researchers said the national health service faces a huge challenge in battling the illnesses .
they also claimed that the nhs could do better to manage coronary heart disease -lrb- chd -rrb- and diabetes .
the report was commissioned by the association of the british pharmaceutical industry -lrb- abpi -rrb- .
it claimed that while fatalities were on the up , the nhs could better manage coronary heart disease and diabetes through ground-breaking medicines that would save tens of thousands of uk lives .
edward bramley-harker , an associate director of nera , the independent economic consultancy which conducted the research , said while modern medicines had made a " huge " impact on the current treatment of chd and diabetes , the number of sufferers was expected to surge over the next two decades . "
lifestyle and diet have an important role to play but modern medicines can make a real difference " abpi " however , with better diagnosis and more pro-active treatment of these diseases , the nhs will be able to save lives and expensive hospital stays as well as treat more patients each year , " he said .
an estimated half a million people north of the border have chd .
more people in scotland die from the disease than in any other part of the uk , with 261 deaths per 100,000 men and 98 per 100,000 women in 2001 .
monday 's report said wider prescribing of statins could prevent 30,000 heart attacks and 20,000 strokes in the uk over the next five years and save 14,000 lives from chd .
the uk rate of doses of the drug , which has already saved some 6,000 lives , was 24 per 1,000 patients in the five years to 2002 , compared to 52 in norway .
' increasing uptake ' the uk heart protection study said statins saved the life of one in every 58 users .
tighter management of blood glucose for those already diagnosed with diabetes could save 380,000 hospital bed days and allow the nhs to treat an extra 78,000 uk patients per year by 2007 , the report added .
and , with effective diagnosis and treatment of diabetes and chd , doctors would also be able to treat more than 100,000 extra patients per year in 20 years ' time .
jim eadie , director of the abpi scotland , said : " scotland has one of the highest rates of heart disease in the developed world .

that is the reality for many people with autism , a developmental disability affecting social skills .
an international conference organised by autism cymru in cardiff from monday to wednesday aims to explode the " myths " and increase awareness .
autistic spectrum disorders are estimated to affect 20,000 people across wales .
as well as having problems with social relationships , people with autism often prefer sameness , and have difficulties accepting changes to their routines .
many of the traits of autism are also shared by asperger 's syndrome , although people with this condition are often " high-functioning " , appearing to function normally most of the time .
some of annis ' work is being shown in cardiff city hall their condition only becomes apparent to others when placed in stressful situations , when they become anxious and distressed .
mark annis , an artist with asperger 's syndrome who will exhibit some of his work at the event , said many people with autism faced very difficult childhoods , and were bullied at school because they were different and did not fit into peer groups .
mr annis , 42 , from penarth , near cardiff , said this hostility never stopped , and people with autism stay as " outsiders " in adult society .
" people tend to see us as abrupt people - rude or downright offensive at times - it is quite frightening , " he said .
he believed a general lack of understanding of the condition saw autistic people demonised .
" i recently told a woman i was asperger 's - she was very offensive , she said i should be in psychiatric hospital .
" i have been spat at in the street , the attitude is so negative .
i have friends who have asperger 's who have been traumatised by people 's attitudes - one of them committed suicide . < mark annis " especially if you are a man on your own - it is fed by the paranoia of the stranger in the street .
improved understanding he argues that many people with asperger 's " ca n't live in a society like this " .
" they are saying " i ca n't get a partner , get a proper peer group , get a circle of friends , or go out without risking being rebuffed all the time . "
" i have friends who have asperger 's who have been traumatised by people 's attitudes - one of them committed suicide . "
he was classed " educationally subnormal " when at school .
" when i left school , my mum advised me , ' do n't come out - do n't admit you are disabled , as they will probably have the police around ' .
i was advised to keep quiet .
" today , there is improved understanding among people who are educated about asperger 's .
the ' high functioning ' of people with asperger 's can cause problems " but the other side - those who do n't know - they are more hostile and more paranoid when they do find out .
" people with asperger 's are facing a really hard time to get the professions to explain to the general public , as well as the parents and guardians .
" there is still this perception , particularly in relation to parents and the professions , that people with asperger 's ca n't do much or are incapable of holding down a relationship , holding down a job or pursuing a talent or having a career .
" but we have so much to offer - it 's a long process . "
he believes people with autism should " try to be themselves " .
" not everything revolves around running businesses or being cool or trying to be life their peers - you have got to be an individual and develop your finer qualities , your talents and strengths .
but part of the problem for people with asperger 's syndrome is that they are high-functioning .
" at least if you are more severely autistic , people know and they do n't take offence . "
the conference will be held from monday to wednesday , 17 - 19 may , in cardiff city hall to coincide with autism awareness week .

that is the reality for many people with autism , a developmental disability affecting social skills .
an international conference organised by autism cymru in cardiff from monday to wednesday aims to explode the " myths " and increase awareness .
autistic spectrum disorders are estimated to affect 20,000 people across wales .
as well as having problems with social relationships , people with autism often prefer sameness , and have difficulties accepting changes to their routines .
many of the traits of autism are also shared by asperger 's syndrome , although people with this condition are often " high-functioning " , appearing to function normally most of the time .
some of annis ' work is being shown in cardiff city hall their condition only becomes apparent to others when placed in stressful situations , when they become anxious and distressed .
mark annis , an artist with asperger 's syndrome who will exhibit some of his work at the event , said many people with autism faced very difficult childhoods , and were bullied at school because they were different and did not fit into peer groups .
mr annis , 42 , from penarth , near cardiff , said this hostility never stopped , and people with autism stay as " outsiders " in adult society .
" people tend to see us as abrupt people - rude or downright offensive at times - it is quite frightening , " he said .
he believed a general lack of understanding of the condition saw autistic people demonised .
" i recently told a woman i was asperger 's - she was very offensive , she said i should be in psychiatric hospital .
" i have been spat at in the street , the attitude is so negative .
i have friends who have asperger 's who have been traumatised by people 's attitudes - one of them committed suicide . < mark annis " especially if you are a man on your own - it is fed by the paranoia of the stranger in the street .
improved understanding he argues that many people with asperger 's " ca n't live in a society like this " .
" they are saying " i ca n't get a partner , get a proper peer group , get a circle of friends , or go out without risking being rebuffed all the time . "
" i have friends who have asperger 's who have been traumatised by people 's attitudes - one of them committed suicide . "
he was classed " educationally subnormal " when at school .
" when i left school , my mum advised me , ' do n't come out - do n't admit you are disabled , as they will probably have the police around ' .
i was advised to keep quiet .
" today , there is improved understanding among people who are educated about asperger 's .
the ' high functioning ' of people with asperger 's can cause problems " but the other side - those who do n't know - they are more hostile and more paranoid when they do find out .
" people with asperger 's are facing a really hard time to get the professions to explain to the general public , as well as the parents and guardians .
" there is still this perception , particularly in relation to parents and the professions , that people with asperger 's ca n't do much or are incapable of holding down a relationship , holding down a job or pursuing a talent or having a career .
" but we have so much to offer - it 's a long process . "
he believes people with autism should " try to be themselves " .
" not everything revolves around running businesses or being cool or trying to be life their peers - you have got to be an individual and develop your finer qualities , your talents and strengths .
but part of the problem for people with asperger 's syndrome is that they are high-functioning .
" at least if you are more severely autistic , people know and they do n't take offence . "
the conference will be held from monday to wednesday , 17 - 19 may , in cardiff city hall to coincide with autism awareness week .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- kenya bribes are growing bigger bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies monday , 17 may , 2004 , 06:39 gmt 07:39 uk kenya bribes are growing bigger by orla ryan in nairobi , kenya kenyan lawyer haron ndubi used to drink at a nairobi bar popular with public servants and politicians .
anytime of day and night those people had money to spend , he says .
but in recent months , the bar has emptied out , reflecting the empty pockets of its former clientele .
" a lot of public servants who used to spend money there used to get that money from corruption .
i consider -lsb- the empty bar -rsb- a manifestation of the fact that their source has dried up , " says mr ndubi .
mr ndubi believes there has been a fall in corruption since president mwai kibaki came to power in december 2002 .
under president kibaki 's predecessor , daniel arap moi , corruption was rife and had become a way of life for many .
a year and a half into mr kibaki 's administration and there is evidence that much has changed .
the percentage of encounters with officials where bribes were demanded has fallen from 65 % to 40 % , according to a transparency international survey .
former bribe takers now risk losing their jobs if they ask for a " little extra " .
this greater risk has however meant that the bribes have become larger to compensate for the greater risks to those taking them .
the average size of a bribe has risen from 2,300 kenyan shillings -lrb- £ 16 ; $ 29 -rrb- to 3,960 shillings , according to transparency international .
fight against corruption mr ndubi , who is a former council member of kenya 's law society , points to concrete evidence of action having been taken against corruption .
the new government has passed the public offices ethics act and the anti corruption and economic crimes act .
jobs in the public service and tenders for government contracts are now advertised regularly .
corrupt judges have been suspended and procurement officers have been sacked .
the kenya anti corruption commission is not yet fully institituted , but it exists .
the goldenberg inquiry into billions of dollars of stolen money continues , dominating the daily pages of kenya 's papers .
critics of the narc government however say that it has focused on the corruption of the previous regime and its commitment to tackling current misdemeanours is half-hearted .
mr ndubi offers a cynical and widely held view , which supports the transparency international survey .
" there are people who are of the opinion that corruption has become more expensive and sophisticated because of the risk you expose yourself to if you are caught out , " he said .
business pain it appears that the nature , if not the fact , of corruption is changing .
for those used to buying favours , change can be a painful process .
indeed , while many businesses welcome the chance to compete for government contracts , others find it hard to survive in an environment where they can no longer buy contracts .
laban onditi rao , the owner of bibil engineering works , said that previously it was difficult to get government contracts unless you had political connections .
the new government 's initiative on corruption has made many businesses nervous , he said , as they now face real competition .
" there is no short cut , they have to be ready for competition , which has not been there before , " mr onditi , also the vice chairman of the kenya chamber of commerce , said .
" the government is a huge consumer to all what we are trading in . "
one businesswoman told me that the crackdown on corruption hurt poorer people first .
" here corruption used to take place from the bottom to the top ; now it just takes place at the top ... which is very unfair , " she laughed .
patrick asingo , a research fellow at the institute of policy , analysis and research , said progress has been made but breaking the cycle of corruption will be hard .
when corruption runs in " the veins " , it takes time to tackle it , he said .
economic joy ?
while there might be some short-term pain for uncompetitive businesses , a less corrupt environment can in a broader sense only be good news for the kenyan economy .
the cost of corruption was high as officials siphoned money from public accounts and businesses faced bribery " taxes " , luka obbanda , director of operations at the investment promotion centre said .
since the new government came to power , more investors are enquiring about doing business in kenya , a fact he links to the " drastic " fall in corruption .
" if you get a licence for $ 10 , you spend another $ 10 or more to get it -lsb- in bribes -rsb- , the cost of that licence has gone up , the cost of doing business has gone up ... your business is likely to suffer , " he said .
it was this huge cost to the economy and business that forced narc to act , mr ndubi said .
for mr ndubi , the issue now is maintaining the momentum in the fight against corruption .
" the government might lose the opportunity if people give up , if they think nobody is interested , it will go back to business as usual , " he said .

posters urge kenyans to shun corruption anytime of day and night those people had money to spend , he says .
but in recent months , the bar has emptied out , reflecting the empty pockets of its former clientele .
" a lot of public servants who used to spend money there used to get that money from corruption .
i consider -lsb- the empty bar -rsb- a manifestation of the fact that their source has dried up , " says mr ndubi .
mr ndubi believes there has been a fall in corruption since president mwai kibaki came to power in december 2002 .
under president kibaki 's predecessor , daniel arap moi , corruption was rife and had become a way of life for many .
a year and a half into mr kibaki 's administration and there is evidence that much has changed .
the percentage of encounters with officials where bribes were demanded has fallen from 65 % to 40 % , according to a transparency international survey .
former bribe takers now risk losing their jobs if they ask for a " little extra " .
this greater risk has however meant that the bribes have become larger to compensate for the greater risks to those taking them .
the average size of a bribe has risen from 2,300 kenyan shillings -lrb- £ 16 ; $ 29 -rrb- to 3,960 shillings , according to transparency international .
fight against corruption mr ndubi , who is a former council member of kenya 's law society , points to concrete evidence of action having been taken against corruption .
the new government has passed the public offices ethics act and the anti corruption and economic crimes act .
mr ndubi : " corruption has become more expensive and sophisticated " jobs in the public service and tenders for government contracts are now advertised regularly .
corrupt judges have been suspended and procurement officers have been sacked .
the kenya anti corruption commission is not yet fully institituted , but it exists .
the goldenberg inquiry into billions of dollars of stolen money continues , dominating the daily pages of kenya 's papers .
critics of the narc government however say that it has focused on the corruption of the previous regime and its commitment to tackling current misdemeanours is half-hearted .
mr ndubi offers a cynical and widely held view , which supports the transparency international survey .
" there are people who are of the opinion that corruption has become more expensive and sophisticated because of the risk you expose yourself to if you are caught out , " he said .
business pain it appears that the nature , if not the fact , of corruption is changing .
for those used to buying favours , change can be a painful process .
indeed , while many businesses welcome the chance to compete for government contracts , others find it hard to survive in an environment where they can no longer buy contracts .
the crackdown on corruption hits poor people first laban onditi rao , the owner of bibil engineering works , said that previously it was difficult to get government contracts unless you had political connections .
the new government 's initiative on corruption has made many businesses nervous , he said , as they now face real competition .
" there is no short cut , they have to be ready for competition , which has not been there before , " mr onditi , also the vice chairman of the kenya chamber of commerce , said .
" the government is a huge consumer to all what we are trading in . "
one businesswoman told me that the crackdown on corruption hurt poorer people first .
" here corruption used to take place from the bottom to the top ; now it just takes place at the top ... which is very unfair , " she laughed .
patrick asingo , a research fellow at the institute of policy , analysis and research , said progress has been made but breaking the cycle of corruption will be hard .
when corruption runs in " the veins " , it takes time to tackle it , he said .
economic joy ?
while there might be some short-term pain for uncompetitive businesses , a less corrupt environment can in a broader sense only be good news for the kenyan economy .
the cost of corruption was high as officials siphoned money from public accounts and businesses faced bribery " taxes " , luka obbanda , director of operations at the investment promotion centre said .
since the new government came to power , more investors are enquiring about doing business in kenya , a fact he links to the " drastic " fall in corruption .
" if you get a licence for $ 10 , you spend another $ 10 or more to get it -lsb- in bribes -rsb- , the cost of that licence has gone up , the cost of doing business has gone up ... your business is likely to suffer , " he said .
it was this huge cost to the economy and business that forced narc to act , mr ndubi said .
for mr ndubi , the issue now is maintaining the momentum in the fight against corruption .
" the government might lose the opportunity if people give up , if they think nobody is interested , it will go back to business as usual , " he said .

as the lead singer of the smiths , steven patrick morrissey became one of the 1980s ' most unlikely icons .
with his national health spectacles , hearing aid , and gladioli hanging out of back pockets , the singer struck a chord with music fans who felt left out by the slick , chart-friendly pop stars of the time .
the combination of his lyrics and the emotive guitar-playing of bandmate johnny marr turned the manchester band into one of the most influential groups of the last 25 years .
the distinctive lyrics of the sometime wannabe-music journalist on tracks such as how soon is now , last night i dreamed somebody loved me and ask , painted the picture of a terminally shy , sexually reticent outsider .
the persona was one morrissey would jealously guard through the smiths messy break-up in 1987 and into his solo career .
born to irish parents in salford on 22 may 1959 , the young morrissey was a shy , well-read teenager who became passionate about music and film .
morrissey and marr before the end of the 1970s he had had two books published - one a james dean biography , the other a book about pioneering us punk band the new york dolls .
he was also a regular letter writer to the weekly music magazine melody maker , being published many times , and the president of the new york dolls ' uk fanclub .
morrissey tried his hand at singing and auditioned for several bands before meeting marr through mutual friends in 1982 .
the pair soon formed a band , with mike joyce on drums and andy rourke on bass .
they became a sensation from their first single , 1983 's hand in glove , and morrissey a style icon in stark contrast to the over-coiffered pop stars of the day .
their music and imagery delighted in gloomy , melancholy viewpoint , the lyrics morose but spiked with wit .
through the course of four studio albums - the smiths , meat is murder , the queen is dead and strangeways , here we come - morrissey 's persona as a wildean wit was cemented .
the smiths became the archetypal british indie band and an influence on acts from oasis to rem and even rappers outkast .
the band broke up at the peak of their popularity , after a series of bitter arguments between marr and morrissey over the direction the band should take .
only six months after the smiths split , morrissey had embarked on a solo career , releasing the album viva hate to music press acclaim , featuring mournful classic everyday is like sunday .
contentious musically , he suffered a setback with 1991 's kill uncle , a record that received disastrous reviews , but more serious concerns were made about his politics the following year .
supporting madness in finsbury park , north london in 1992 , morrissey appeared covered in a union flag , with a giant backdrop of a skinhead behind him .
not since david bowie 's 1976 nazi salute had a pop star made such a loaded statement .
morrissey 's position was not helped by the fact he had recorded a song called bengali in platforms , included on viva hate .
he followed that up with the equally contentious national front disco , on the 1992 album your arsenal .
accusations of racism were levelled by the music press , and despite releasing the well-received album vauxhall and i in 1994 , his influence began to wane .
in 1996 , a judge called him " devious , truculent and unreliable " in a royalties case brought by former smiths bandmates joyce and rourke .
the bad blood over the case - the duo claimed they had not been paid enough performance payments - has quashed any chance of a smiths reunion .
in 1997 , after the album maladjusted , morrissey moved to los angeles , where he was a cult star - and went into artistic hibernation , save for occasional live dates .
in 2003 , it was announced the singer , who had been without a record deal , had been signed to independent label sanctuary records .
it followed an appearance in a channel 4 documentary , the importance of being morrissey , his first major tv appearance since a south bank show programme some 16 years earlier .
a kind of critical re-evaluation of the singer seemed to arrive with the announcement he was to curate the meltdown festival on at london 's south bank centre in the summer .
the music press has been praising his new album you are the quarry , a typically morrissey-esque album that , despite coming from la , seems pre-occupied with a northern english worldview that has remained with him nearly 20 years after the demise of the smiths .

with his national health spectacles , hearing aid , and gladioli hanging out of back pockets , the singer struck a chord with music fans who felt left out by the slick , chart-friendly pop stars of the time .
the combination of his lyrics and the emotive guitar-playing of bandmate johnny marr turned the manchester band into one of the most influential groups of the last 25 years .

born to irish parents in salford on 22 may 1959 , the young morrissey was a shy , well-read teenager who became passionate about music and film .

through the course of four studio albums - the smiths , meat is murder , the queen is dead and strangeways , here we come - morrissey 's persona as a wildean wit was cemented .

profits rose to 45m australian dollars -lrb- $ 31.2m ; £ 17.7m -rrb- in the year ending 31 march , up 45 % on the previous year .
but shares fell on concerns about rising fuel prices and new competition .
the figures come hard on the heels of the firm 's decision to add a a $ 6 surcharge to the price of each ticket to cover the surging cost of jet fuel .
budget rival fuel prices at virgin blue increased by more than 28 % during the year , although the firm said it " was substantially hedged " for the current financial year at below $ 30 per barrel .
the ticket surcharge will come into effect at midnight on tuesday .
" we will continue to grow our business aggressively , however , we will focus on profitable growth , not simply greater domestic market share , " said chief executive brett godfrey .
he said australia 's domestic airline industry had become increasingly competitive , with national carrier qantas launching its own budget airline , jetstar , later this month to directly challenge virgin blue .
virgin blue said it will add a further five aircraft to the fleet during the year .
however , the company 's stock fell 2.8 % to a $ 2.06 , well below its a $ 2.25 issue price , on continued fears over the impact of higher fuel prices .
