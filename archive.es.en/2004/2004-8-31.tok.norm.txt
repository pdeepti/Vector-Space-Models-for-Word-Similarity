" milosevic , who is acting as his own lawyer , told the court that he needed more than the 150 days allotted to him to cross-examine more than 1,600 witnesses whom he has said he intends to call to the stand . rejecting the prosecution 's claim that he masterminded the bloody wars that tore apart the yugoslav federation in the early 1990s , he said in his opening defence statement that the international community was " the main force for the destruction " of the country . he also blamed " the nato pact " for the conflict in kosovo , a province of his native serbia , where more than 10,000 people died and about 800,000 ethnic albanians - one-third of the population - were expelled in 1988 and 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of u.n. officals watch a burning serbian house in the serb village of svinjare , south of kosovska mitrovica , saturday march 20 , 2004 .

milosevic faces a total of 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the 1991-95 war in croatia , the 1992-95 war in bosnia and the kosovo campaign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2004 germans mull vote on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public is n't likely to be voting on the eu constitution the ruling social democratic party 's plan to alter the constitution and introduce plebiscites to the german political scene was quickly rejected by opposition parties , but debate may not be over yet . after months of discussion , the issue of who should vote on what and how has come to the forefront as german leaders ponder whether to approve the new constitution for the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in a surprising change of opinion , chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- , who last month said a parliamentary vote would ratify the eu constitution in germany , this weekend suggested changing germany 's constitution to allow voters to decide on major issues - with the condition the changes apply to domestic as well as european topics .
" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .
the greens , the ruling coalition 's junior partner , were pleased with the chancellor 's new line , as were the neo-liberal free democrats .
green party head angelika beer said she hopes " the spd 's clear signal " will prompt the opposition to express support for plebiscites .
opposition against domestic plebiscites but while the government would find backing for european votes , it is domestic decisions that conservative opposition parties are against .
without their help the spd does n't have a chance of reaching the two-thirds majority needed for the changes to pass in the bundestag and bundesrat , germany 's two houses of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's laurenz meyer said his party could still change its mind laurenz meyer , the christian democratic union 's secretary general , expressed his party 's " serious concerns " about domestic plebiscites , which are currently only called when the country restructures federal territory .
but he said the last word has n't be spoken until after his party meets wednesday .
political wrangling other cdu members , however , were less reserved , calling the chancellor 's change of direction nothing but politics as usual .
" it 's a tactical trick , " matthias wissmann , chair of the cdu 's european committee , told the berliner zeitung .
" the spd hopes for enough resistance among its own party and in the opposition that the suggestion does n't find the needed majority and can say ' well , we tried . " '
resistance to voter-determined domestic decisions also came from the christian social union , but markus söder , that party 's secretary general , said letting voters decide whether to accept major changes to european law would ensure germans are aware of how they are affected by brussels decisions .
timely decision but some spd members said it was more important to ratify the eu constitution quickly than to spend time trying to introduce referendums in germany .
angelica schwall-düren , the spd 's deputy chair , said she did n't think the time was right for german constitutional changes , referring to a failed attempt to introduce referendums two years ago .
so far a total of 10 nations , including france and britain , have decided to hold referendums on the european constitution .
the constitution will only be enacted if it is ratified by all 25 of the bloc 's member states . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics .

16 , 2004 -rrb- a referendum for germany after all ?
while the verdict is still out on whether berlin will call for a referendum on the eu constitution , some politicians are calling for legislation that will allow for plebiscites on citizen 's initiatives .

it added that the private sphere of prominent persons in germany was not adequately protected and that press freedom was given priority at the cost of privacy . " journalists will be muzzled " the european court of human rights also ruled that public figures would have to give their consent before the publication of material about their private lives - both pictures and the written word - could be permitted . journalists and editors fear that the decision will have major consequences for german media as a whole . " if the german government does n't appeal the judgment then it would mean that all serious journalists will be muzzled , " monday 's open letter to the chancellor read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors in germany fear that the freedom of the press is under siege following the european court of human rights ruling in june .
the editors , from newsmagazines spiegel , focus , stern and leading mass-circulation daily bild among others , said they were concerned that the european court of human rights decision meant that prominent people could in future determine what was reported about them .
" with that , the most important duty of the press - to closely watch the powerful - will be massively hindered , " they said in the letter . separately , the chairman of public broadcaster ard , jobst plog , and the head of public broadcaster zdf , markus schächter , sent a joint letter to german justice minister brigitte zypries , stressing they would " strongly welcomed " the government appealing the european court judgment .
" there are fears that this special case will result in unregulated general restrictions for future picture reporting , " they wrote . earlier decision overruled the june 24th decision by the european court of human rights overruled a 1999 decision in the same case by germany 's constitutional court . the german court had ruled that , as a " person of contemporary history , " caroline would have to accept that photos of her in publicly accessible places could be published without her permission .
with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children , the german constitutional court dismissed her claim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias prinz , princess caroline 's lawyer , speaks to journalists in june .
caroline 's lawyers , who argued that her children were constantly being followed and that photographers frequently staked out their schools , took the case to the european court of human rights . the judges in strasbourg said the german verdict contradicted the right to respect for private and family life , anchored in the european convention on human rights . a hard blow for democracy the german editors protesting the ruling say , however , that as it stands , the decision would only permit reporting on public figures in their public role .

it added that the private sphere of prominent persons in germany was not adequately protected and that press freedom was given priority at the cost of privacy . " journalists will be muzzled " the european court of human rights also ruled that public figures would have to give their consent before the publication of material about their private lives - both pictures and the written word - could be permitted . journalists and editors fear that the decision will have major consequences for german media as a whole . " if the german government does n't appeal the judgment then it would mean that all serious journalists will be muzzled , " monday 's open letter to the chancellor read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors in germany fear that the freedom of the press is under siege following the european court of human rights ruling in june .
the editors , from newsmagazines spiegel , focus , stern and leading mass-circulation daily bild among others , said they were concerned that the european court of human rights decision meant that prominent people could in future determine what was reported about them .
" with that , the most important duty of the press - to closely watch the powerful - will be massively hindered , " they said in the letter . separately , the chairman of public broadcaster ard , jobst plog , and the head of public broadcaster zdf , markus schächter , sent a joint letter to german justice minister brigitte zypries , stressing they would " strongly welcomed " the government appealing the european court judgment .
" there are fears that this special case will result in unregulated general restrictions for future picture reporting , " they wrote . earlier decision overruled the june 24th decision by the european court of human rights overruled a 1999 decision in the same case by germany 's constitutional court . the german court had ruled that , as a " person of contemporary history , " caroline would have to accept that photos of her in publicly accessible places could be published without her permission .
with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children , the german constitutional court dismissed her claim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias prinz , princess caroline 's lawyer , speaks to journalists in june .
caroline 's lawyers , who argued that her children were constantly being followed and that photographers frequently staked out their schools , took the case to the european court of human rights . the judges in strasbourg said the german verdict contradicted the right to respect for private and family life , anchored in the european convention on human rights . a hard blow for democracy the german editors protesting the ruling say , however , that as it stands , the decision would only permit reporting on public figures in their public role .
how these people behave , who their business contacts are or who pays for their holidays would go unreported , according to the newsmen . the editors also listed major domestic german news stories that would not have seen the light of day under the new ruling .
they include the perks scandal which led to the resignation of the previous head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , and the investment activities of the former head of germany 's powerful metal workers ' union , franz steinkühler . late last week the german association of newspaper publishers publicly voiced their unease .
an industry spokesman said that , if left unchallenged , the ruling would mark a hard blow for democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the media chiefs have also pointed out that the german government has only four weeks left to contest the european court 's ruling . a government spokesman said chancellor schröder was still considering the legal aspects of the case before deciding on the matter . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paparazzi ruling could restrict german tabloids princess caroline of monaco won her case against german tabloids at the european court of human rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.08.2004 opinion : reclaiming islam from the radicals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french muslims say the journalists ' kidnapping has no basis in islam with two french journalists facing execution in iraq by islamic radicals unless france scraps an imminent headscarf ban in schools , muslims are protesting against the hijacking of their religion by terror groups . it is not only the government in paris and numerous colleagues who demand the release of the two kidnapped french journalists in iraq who have been threatened with death : there are also many voices from the islamic world , including amr mussa , the secretary-general of the arab league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .
their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .

their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2004 fischer wraps up mideast tour amid violence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer , left , with egyptian president mubarak in alexandria overshadowed by two bomb explosions in israel , german foreign minister fischer ended his five-nation middle east tour in egypt on tuesday . german foreign minister joschka fischer concluded his middle east tour focusing on the arab-israeli conflict and economic and political modernization of the region with a sharp condemnation of terrorism and violence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an israeli police officer clears the area in front of the destroyed bus at the scene of a double-bombing in the southern israeli city of beersheba .
referring to double suicide bomb attacks that ripped through two buses in the southern israeli town of beersheba on tuesday killing at least 12 people , fischer said that it was clear that " all efforts had to be taken to bring peace and stability in the region . "
the minister said there had to be an end to terror and violence . " the killing of innocent people on both sides is not acceptable , " he added . a respected mediator earlier fischer , on the last leg of his five-day , five-nation middle east visit , held talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak and prime minister ahmed nasif in alexandria , praising egypt 's peace engagement in gaza .
the two sides also discussed ways of reviving the stalled peace process between the israelis and palestinians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , at a hotel in alexandria , egypt .
in addition , fischer also met with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia in alexandria the german foreign minister , a well-respected mediator in the middle east , repeated what he said in jerusalem a day earlier : that the eu wanted israel 's planned pullout in the gaza strip to be part of a us-backed peace plan and thus take place in coordination with the palestinians .
" gaza can mean a significant progress for the peace process , " fischer said . at the same time the minister said the palestinians also had to cooperate to enable israel to execute its pullout . arab-israeli conflict the main issue the ongoing arab-israeli conflict has been the dominant theme of fischer 's talks in all five mideast countries on his itinerary , beginning with lebanon and on to syria , jordan , israel and finally , egypt . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , in damascus on saturday . during talks with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom in jerusalem on monday , fischer made it clear that a pullout in gaza alone would not suffice , but had to be accompanied by similar steps in the west bank .
" this would lead to a breakthrough , and we in germany and the eu are ready to engage ourselves , " fischer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom , right , with gernman foreign minister joschka fischer during their meeting in jerusalem .
at the same time the minister stressed it was important for israel to halt construction of west bank settlements according to terms of the internationally backed " road map " peace plan . fischer has also underlined that the european union remains committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " he said . sharon brings forward gaza pullout on tuesday sharon announced that evacuation of all 21 jewish settlements from gaza is set for the beginning of next year , advancing the controversial pullout schedule by about eight months . under the gaza plan , four of the 120 settlements in the west bank - home to about 240,000 settlers - would also be moved by next year .
but israeli prime minister ariel sharon intends to hold on to an arc of larger enclaves there . israel seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war .
the international community sees jewish settlements built on those territories as illegal , a view israel disputes . european security linked to mideast 's fischer 's mideast trip has been largely viewed symbolically as peace and stability deteriorate while infighting and chaos paralyzes the palestinian authority and israel continues to build a security wall in violation of international norms . but the german foreign minister was also frank and upfront with his mideast hosts . he condemned syrian interference in lebanon , warned damascus to improve its human rights record and agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction , and urged amman to initiate internal reforms .
even fischer 's message to sharon that gaza can only be the beginning of peace is considered a bold move , given that the pullout remains so controversial in israel . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , in amman , jordan on sunday . in jordan on sunday , fischer gave a hint of the reasons behind his unflagging efforts in the search for a solution to the middle east conflict : " when we talk of our security as europeans , we are talking about the future of our neighbors the middle east , " he said in a press conference .
" if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace .

putin and schröder then held informal bilateral talks during the evening with chirac expected to join the discussions early the next morning after an overnight flight from paris . chirac had been forced to delay his arrival owing to the abduction of two french journalists in iraq by kidnappers who have given paris an ultimatum over its ban on the wearing of the muslim headscarf in state schools .
but the french president did not want to cancel the meeting with his two fellow opponents of the us-led invasion of iraq and arrived early on tuesday in the scenic resort . along with iraq , the three leaders were expected to discuss relations between the european union and russia , as well as regional questions , two days after a controversial presidential election in the war-torn russian republic of chechnya . the leaders began the day with a working breakfast , followed by trilateral talks , with officials emphasizing that the meeting was informal , with no fixed agenda and no necessity to take decisions .
the informality was confirmed by the sighting of the trio chatting in english on the veranda of the residence before heading into their talks after breakfast . chirac reiterates stance on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the mini-summit began after islamic militants holding two french journalists captive gave paris another 24 hours to scrap its controversial ban on the wearing in public schools of islamic headscarves and other signs of religious affiliation .
that ban , made law in france earlier this year , was due to go into effect this week and france has asserted that the law safeguards the country 's stringent secular traditions and will stand . chirac reiterated his call for the release of two journalists .

" if the chechen people came out to vote , that means they wanted to decide their republic 's future .
no one dragged them by the scruff of their necks or their hair to the voting stations . " the vote was denounced on monday by the united states as falling short of international standards of freedom and fairness and having " serious flaws " .
the european commission on tuesday also condemned the poll and called for early parliamentary polls in the strife-torn russian republic .
putin confirmed that both chirac and schröder questioned him about the war and said he gave them " detailed " answers . schröder calls for political solution schröder revealed to the press conference that he told putin that " the chechen conflict must be resolved politically , the way that putin has said it would , " and added , " we will continue to look for a solution in critical solidarity .

france and germany have said they would help train iraqi officers but only outside the country , while russia has offered to help train civilian personnel and said it would consider restructuring iraq 's multibillion dollar debt through the paris club of creditor nations .

putin and schröder then held informal bilateral talks during the evening with chirac expected to join the discussions early the next morning after an overnight flight from paris . chirac had been forced to delay his arrival owing to the abduction of two french journalists in iraq by kidnappers who have given paris an ultimatum over its ban on the wearing of the muslim headscarf in state schools .
but the french president did not want to cancel the meeting with his two fellow opponents of the us-led invasion of iraq and arrived early on tuesday in the scenic resort . along with iraq , the three leaders were expected to discuss relations between the european union and russia , as well as regional questions , two days after a controversial presidential election in the war-torn russian republic of chechnya . the leaders began the day with a working breakfast , followed by trilateral talks , with officials emphasizing that the meeting was informal , with no fixed agenda and no necessity to take decisions .
the informality was confirmed by the sighting of the trio chatting in english on the veranda of the residence before heading into their talks after breakfast . chirac reiterates stance on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the mini-summit began after islamic militants holding two french journalists captive gave paris another 24 hours to scrap its controversial ban on the wearing in public schools of islamic headscarves and other signs of religious affiliation .
that ban , made law in france earlier this year , was due to go into effect this week and france has asserted that the law safeguards the country 's stringent secular traditions and will stand . chirac reiterated his call for the release of two journalists . " i am renewing my solemn call for their release , " chirac told reporters at the post-talks press conference .
" everything will be done to secure their release . " putin meanwhile faced his own challenges from extremists in the aftermath of apparent suicide bomber attacks that brought down two commercial airliners in russia last week with the loss of 90 lives . two women from russia 's separatist republic of chechnya , where russian forces are mired in a five-year guerrilla war , were suspected of bringing the planes down and putin has ordered law enforcement agencies to take higher precautions against further " terrorist acts " in russia . putin defends elections in chechnya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya is an on-going dirty war on russia 's doorstep .
chechnya would always remain a part of russia , putin said and defended the elections in the state at the weekend which had been widely criticized . " the chechen people have made their choice , " putin told reporters .
" if the chechen people came out to vote , that means they wanted to decide their republic 's future .
no one dragged them by the scruff of their necks or their hair to the voting stations . " the vote was denounced on monday by the united states as falling short of international standards of freedom and fairness and having " serious flaws " .
the european commission on tuesday also condemned the poll and called for early parliamentary polls in the strife-torn russian republic .
putin confirmed that both chirac and schröder questioned him about the war and said he gave them " detailed " answers . schröder calls for political solution schröder revealed to the press conference that he told putin that " the chechen conflict must be resolved politically , the way that putin has said it would , " and added , " we will continue to look for a solution in critical solidarity . " jacques chirac said he supported his russian counterpart vladimir putin in seeking a political solution in chechnya , provided that it preserves russia 's territorial integrity . " a political solution is necessary and this is what russia wants but a political solution has a limit , " chirac said at the press conference .
pledge of support for iraq but no details on the subject of iraq , all three leaders pledged to work toward bringing stability to the war-torn country , but gave no concrete details about what steps they would take . " we have an interest in contributing everything possible to lead to stabilizing the situation , " putin said but failed to elaborate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. army continues to fight battles across iraq .
putin , schröder and chirac have toned down their criticism of the situation in iraq since their opposition before the us-led invasion , but they made clear their concern about the troubled security situation in iraq . all three nations have refused to send troops to iraq to help in peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts .
france and germany have said they would help train iraqi officers but only outside the country , while russia has offered to help train civilian personnel and said it would consider restructuring iraq 's multibillion dollar debt through the paris club of creditor nations .
russia to continue increase in oil production in a further statement , putin announced that russia would continue to increase the extraction and export of its oil resources . russian firms would " continue to increase the extraction of hydrocarbons and that they will increase their deliveries to the global market , " the russian president told assembled press . russian oil production is expected to reach 450 million tons this year and export some 255 million tons , an increase from 421 million tons of production and 228 million tons of exports last year , he added . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads for russian summit the leaders of germany and russia will meet in the black sea resort of sochi on monday to address european relations and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq .

they 've long proved to be versatile multimedia gadgets and are now even starring in a short film festival in berlin . a ramshackle volkswagen bus flattens a mobile phone with a sickeningly crunching sound under its tires .
in another variation , a mobile phone is pounded to bits with a golf club or a baseball bat .
that 's how a berlin artist duo demonstrates various death scenarios of mobile phones in a 90-second long sequence - shot with a mobile phone outfitted with video technology . the clip is one of around 150 wildly experimental short films competing for the " micromovie award , " the crowning glory of an international film festival focusing exclusively on films shot with mobile phones .
called " interfilm , " the festival will be debuting in berlin from nov .

referring to double suicide bomb attacks that ripped through two buses in the southern israeli town of beersheba on tuesday killing at least 12 people , fischer said that it was clear that " all efforts had to be taken to bring peace and stability in the region . "
the minister said there had to be an end to terror and violence . " the killing of innocent people on both sides is not acceptable , " he added . a respected mediator earlier fischer , on the last leg of his five-day , five-nation middle east visit , held talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak and prime minister ahmed nasif in alexandria , praising egypt 's peace engagement in gaza .
the two sides also discussed ways of reviving the stalled peace process between the israelis and palestinians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , at a hotel in alexandria , egypt .
in addition , fischer also met with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia in alexandria the german foreign minister , a well-respected mediator in the middle east , repeated what he said in jerusalem a day earlier : that the eu wanted israel 's planned pullout in the gaza strip to be part of a us-backed peace plan and thus take place in coordination with the palestinians .
" gaza can mean a significant progress for the peace process , " fischer said . at the same time the minister said the palestinians also had to cooperate to enable israel to execute its pullout . arab-israeli conflict the main issue the ongoing arab-israeli conflict has been the dominant theme of fischer 's talks in all five mideast countries on his itinerary , beginning with lebanon and on to syria , jordan , israel and finally , egypt . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , in damascus on saturday . during talks with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom in jerusalem on monday , fischer made it clear that a pullout in gaza alone would not suffice , but had to be accompanied by similar steps in the west bank .
" this would lead to a breakthrough , and we in germany and the eu are ready to engage ourselves , " fischer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom , right , with gernman foreign minister joschka fischer during their meeting in jerusalem .
at the same time the minister stressed it was important for israel to halt construction of west bank settlements according to terms of the internationally backed " road map " peace plan . fischer has also underlined that the european union remains committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " he said . sharon brings forward gaza pullout on tuesday sharon announced that evacuation of all 21 jewish settlements from gaza is set for the beginning of next year , advancing the controversial pullout schedule by about eight months . under the gaza plan , four of the 120 settlements in the west bank - home to about 240,000 settlers - would also be moved by next year .
but israeli prime minister ariel sharon intends to hold on to an arc of larger enclaves there . israel seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war .
the international community sees jewish settlements built on those territories as illegal , a view israel disputes . european security linked to mideast 's fischer 's mideast trip has been largely viewed symbolically as peace and stability deteriorate while infighting and chaos paralyzes the palestinian authority and israel continues to build a security wall in violation of international norms . but the german foreign minister was also frank and upfront with his mideast hosts . he condemned syrian interference in lebanon , warned damascus to improve its human rights record and agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction , and urged amman to initiate internal reforms .
even fischer 's message to sharon that gaza can only be the beginning of peace is considered a bold move , given that the pullout remains so controversial in israel . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , in amman , jordan on sunday . in jordan on sunday , fischer gave a hint of the reasons behind his unflagging efforts in the search for a solution to the middle east conflict : " when we talk of our security as europeans , we are talking about the future of our neighbors the middle east , " he said in a press conference .

again the focus was on the east of germany where anger is growing and discontent over conditions in the former communist states is rife . the protests against the german government 's planned welfare cuts entered their fifth week on monday as tens of thousands of germans once again took to the streets of cities across the country to demonstrate . but while chancellor gerhard schröder attempted to appease the nation by reiterating his message that the " hartz iv " reforms would go through for the benefit of germany , a number of politicians and media warned of growing divisions related to the expected effects of the welfare cuts between the former communist eastern germany and the more prosperous west . the proposed cuts to unemployment benefit , a tactic that the chancellor assures will keep the welfare system affordable for an ageing population , are likely to hit the eastern states of germany hardest where unemployment rates are running at nearly 20 percent , twice the level in the more affluent west .
most demonstrations have taken place in eastern cities , with the most vociferous protests once again happening in berlin , leipzig and magdeburg . even former finance minister oskar lafontaine , a long-time political sparring partner of schröder , experienced the growing distaste for anything and anybody attached to the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and was welcomed with whistles and even an egg from a roughly 20,000-strong crowd in leipzig .
despite coming to the platform with an anti-reform message , lafontaine , who is a member of the sdp with strong links to the left , found less support than expected in the crowd .
he called for " an alternative policy of reform " and for a " growth program so that jobs can be created " but the presence of a man rumored to be preparing to form a new political party with other disenchanted spd members divided as much as united the protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eggs and abuse came schröder 's way during last week 's visit to the east .
it is a sign of the massive task the spd has to placate the disenchanted people of the east .
schröder has struggled to get his message across in the region and has faced angry and potentially volatile protests with eggs and abuse hurled at the chancellor 's direction only last week as he visited leipzig and wittenberg . west is more supportive of reforms figures from the federal statistics office show that the chancellor 's proposed reforms are creating a distinctive east / west division in opinion , with more westerners than easterners supporting " hartz iv , " which will cut benefit for many long-term unemployed and set tougher conditions on claimants , introducing stricter means testing to encourage jobless people to take work of any kind . it appears that in the east , where the former communist regime guaranteed a job for almost everybody , the idea of welfare cuts have released bottled-up frustration that after more than a decade of reunification , many feel worse off than before . just 39 percent of east germans happy with schröder 's brand of democratic leadership , compared with 63 percent in the west .
many in the east have begun to fear they will slide into poverty when the benefit cuts take effect in january and that communist rule now does n't seem so bad . dormant unease has found a release valve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this creeping sense of unease in the eastern states has not really been registered either in the media or by political representatives , " franz walter , a political researcher at göttingen university , told the bremen regional newspaper kurier am sonntag : " so these radical and uncontrolled protests were only a matter of time . " the people of the east will get a different opportunity to voice their protests on sept .
19 when they go to the polls in regional elections in the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg .
the ruling social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- are expected to lose ground heavily to the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the former east german communist party .
schröder has accused pds officials of hijacking the reform debate . the chancellor 's not for turning but the chancellor , well aware of the damage a pounding in the state elections would do to the sdp 's credibility nationwide , remains unrepentant .
the reforms , he repeats , will not be watered down and discussing the reforms is not a sign that his resolve is weakening . " showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears ... does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " he said before a party meeting . before the elections take place , more demonstrations are expected .
while the actual numbers of protestors are reported to be less each week , the organizers of the marches have said that the protests for the fifth " monday demonstration " had spread to 202 cities , up from 140 a week ago .
a spokesman for the berlin protesters claimed that more than 200,000 joined the nationwide marches on monday and added that a national demonstration in the capital has been organized for oct .

they 've long proved to be versatile multimedia gadgets and are now even starring in a short film festival in berlin . a ramshackle volkswagen bus flattens a mobile phone with a sickeningly crunching sound under its tires .
in another variation , a mobile phone is pounded to bits with a golf club or a baseball bat .
that 's how a berlin artist duo demonstrates various death scenarios of mobile phones in a 90-second long sequence - shot with a mobile phone outfitted with video technology . the clip is one of around 150 wildly experimental short films competing for the " micromovie award , " the crowning glory of an international film festival focusing exclusively on films shot with mobile phones .
called " interfilm , " the festival will be debuting in berlin from nov .
2 to nov .
7 . in cooperation with its main sponsor , " interfilm " has provided film schools and producers worldwide with the latest mobile phone generation and is now waiting for applications that have to be sent in to berlin by the end of august . short films from around the world bildunterschrift : " solarium " , a short film by konrad sattler there 's little doubt of the popularity of the project .
packets from around 22 countries have already piled up on heide schürmeier 's desk at the " interfilm " office in berlin .
some bear names such as " vancouver film school , " the " univerdsidad del cine " in buenos aires or the " national institute of design " in india . the latter , in particular , has already sent in nine micromovies despite the fact that the indians were equipped with just two mobile phones .
young indian filmmakers have already cemented the bollywood country 's reputation as a quick-film mecca . working with technical limitations but , though shooting with a mobile phone might sound fun , it is n't exactly easy .

they 've long proved to be versatile multimedia gadgets and are now even starring in a short film festival in berlin . a ramshackle volkswagen bus flattens a mobile phone with a sickeningly crunching sound under its tires .
in another variation , a mobile phone is pounded to bits with a golf club or a baseball bat .
that 's how a berlin artist duo demonstrates various death scenarios of mobile phones in a 90-second long sequence - shot with a mobile phone outfitted with video technology . the clip is one of around 150 wildly experimental short films competing for the " micromovie award , " the crowning glory of an international film festival focusing exclusively on films shot with mobile phones .
called " interfilm , " the festival will be debuting in berlin from nov .
2 to nov .
7 . in cooperation with its main sponsor , " interfilm " has provided film schools and producers worldwide with the latest mobile phone generation and is now waiting for applications that have to be sent in to berlin by the end of august . short films from around the world bildunterschrift : " solarium " , a short film by konrad sattler there 's little doubt of the popularity of the project .
packets from around 22 countries have already piled up on heide schürmeier 's desk at the " interfilm " office in berlin .
some bear names such as " vancouver film school , " the " univerdsidad del cine " in buenos aires or the " national institute of design " in india . the latter , in particular , has already sent in nine micromovies despite the fact that the indians were equipped with just two mobile phones .
young indian filmmakers have already cemented the bollywood country 's reputation as a quick-film mecca . working with technical limitations but , though shooting with a mobile phone might sound fun , it is n't exactly easy . " there 's no zoom , the light conditions are different , low storage capacity and just when things begin to get exciting the battery 's empty , " schürmeier said .
" but that 's exactly why it 's so thrilling to see how professionals manage with such limitations .

the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .
the move angered berlin , which contends disciplinary proceedings are only warranted against countries that are being uncooperative on the budgetary issues . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off negotiations at opel continue opinion : blame the managers , not the country business -pipe- 31.08.2004 germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel said germany would stay in the red this year german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in a surprising change of opinion , chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- , who last month said a parliamentary vote would ratify the eu constitution in germany , this weekend suggested changing germany 's constitution to allow voters to decide on major issues - with the condition the changes apply to domestic as well as european topics .
" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .
the greens , the ruling coalition 's junior partner , were pleased with the chancellor 's new line , as were the neo-liberal free democrats .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.08.2004 opinion : reclaiming islam from the radicals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french muslims say the journalists ' kidnapping has no basis in islam with two french journalists facing execution in iraq by islamic radicals unless france scraps an imminent headscarf ban in schools , muslims are protesting against the hijacking of their religion by terror groups . it is not only the government in paris and numerous colleagues who demand the release of the two kidnapped french journalists in iraq who have been threatened with death : there are also many voices from the islamic world , including amr mussa , the secretary-general of the arab league . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .
their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

" milosevic , who is acting as his own lawyer , told the court that he needed more than the 150 days allotted to him to cross-examine more than 1,600 witnesses whom he has said he intends to call to the stand . rejecting the prosecution 's claim that he masterminded the bloody wars that tore apart the yugoslav federation in the early 1990s , he said in his opening defence statement that the international community was " the main force for the destruction " of the country . he also blamed " the nato pact " for the conflict in kosovo , a province of his native serbia , where more than 10,000 people died and about 800,000 ethnic albanians - one-third of the population - were expelled in 1988 and 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of u.n. officals watch a burning serbian house in the serb village of svinjare , south of kosovska mitrovica , saturday march 20 , 2004 .
all of the 130 houses as well as the orthodox cemetery in the village have been looted and burnt by ethnic albanians who attacked the village .
milosevic faces a total of 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the 1991-95 war in croatia , the 1992-95 war in bosnia and the kosovo campaign .
he has also been charged with genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the war in bosnia , which left 200,000 people dead .
he faces a life sentence if convicted . dressed in his customary dark blue suit and a red , blue and white striped tie - the colors of the yugoslav flag - the 63-year-old former president told the three-judge tribunal : " in the international public for a long time an untruthful and distorted picture was created about what happened in yugoslavia .
the accusations against me are unscrupulous lies . " milosevic was given four hours to present the outlines of his defense case but he said he would need two days . " i would like to note that the other side -lrb- the prosecution -rrb- got three days to present their opening statement , " he told the court . health concerns after milosevic completes his opening statement , the judges are expected to hold a procedural hearing to discuss his health problems , which have caused his trial to be adjourned 14 times since it began in february 2002 . the prosecution has urged the court to appoint a defense lawyer to act for milosevic , who they accuse of " hijacking the trial to his agenda while stopping just short of obstructionism . "
but " friends of the court " - lawyers appointed to ensure milosevic gets a fair trial - have warned that it would only add more stress if he were forced to take on a defense lawyer against his will . milosevic said during a procedural hearing that he planned to call british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton as witnesses .
his advisors have confirmed only that former greek prime minister constantine mitsotakis and his former russian counterpart , yevgeny primakov , would be called to testify .

again the focus was on the east of germany where anger is growing and discontent over conditions in the former communist states is rife . the protests against the german government 's planned welfare cuts entered their fifth week on monday as tens of thousands of germans once again took to the streets of cities across the country to demonstrate . but while chancellor gerhard schröder attempted to appease the nation by reiterating his message that the " hartz iv " reforms would go through for the benefit of germany , a number of politicians and media warned of growing divisions related to the expected effects of the welfare cuts between the former communist eastern germany and the more prosperous west . the proposed cuts to unemployment benefit , a tactic that the chancellor assures will keep the welfare system affordable for an ageing population , are likely to hit the eastern states of germany hardest where unemployment rates are running at nearly 20 percent , twice the level in the more affluent west .
most demonstrations have taken place in eastern cities , with the most vociferous protests once again happening in berlin , leipzig and magdeburg . even former finance minister oskar lafontaine , a long-time political sparring partner of schröder , experienced the growing distaste for anything and anybody attached to the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and was welcomed with whistles and even an egg from a roughly 20,000-strong crowd in leipzig .
despite coming to the platform with an anti-reform message , lafontaine , who is a member of the sdp with strong links to the left , found less support than expected in the crowd .
he called for " an alternative policy of reform " and for a " growth program so that jobs can be created " but the presence of a man rumored to be preparing to form a new political party with other disenchanted spd members divided as much as united the protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eggs and abuse came schröder 's way during last week 's visit to the east .
it is a sign of the massive task the spd has to placate the disenchanted people of the east .
schröder has struggled to get his message across in the region and has faced angry and potentially volatile protests with eggs and abuse hurled at the chancellor 's direction only last week as he visited leipzig and wittenberg . west is more supportive of reforms figures from the federal statistics office show that the chancellor 's proposed reforms are creating a distinctive east / west division in opinion , with more westerners than easterners supporting " hartz iv , " which will cut benefit for many long-term unemployed and set tougher conditions on claimants , introducing stricter means testing to encourage jobless people to take work of any kind . it appears that in the east , where the former communist regime guaranteed a job for almost everybody , the idea of welfare cuts have released bottled-up frustration that after more than a decade of reunification , many feel worse off than before . just 39 percent of east germans happy with schröder 's brand of democratic leadership , compared with 63 percent in the west .
many in the east have begun to fear they will slide into poverty when the benefit cuts take effect in january and that communist rule now does n't seem so bad . dormant unease has found a release valve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this creeping sense of unease in the eastern states has not really been registered either in the media or by political representatives , " franz walter , a political researcher at göttingen university , told the bremen regional newspaper kurier am sonntag : " so these radical and uncontrolled protests were only a matter of time . " the people of the east will get a different opportunity to voice their protests on sept .
19 when they go to the polls in regional elections in the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg .
the ruling social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- are expected to lose ground heavily to the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the former east german communist party .
schröder has accused pds officials of hijacking the reform debate . the chancellor 's not for turning but the chancellor , well aware of the damage a pounding in the state elections would do to the sdp 's credibility nationwide , remains unrepentant .
the reforms , he repeats , will not be watered down and discussing the reforms is not a sign that his resolve is weakening . " showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears ... does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " he said before a party meeting . before the elections take place , more demonstrations are expected .
while the actual numbers of protestors are reported to be less each week , the organizers of the marches have said that the protests for the fifth " monday demonstration " had spread to 202 cities , up from 140 a week ago .
a spokesman for the berlin protesters claimed that more than 200,000 joined the nationwide marches on monday and added that a national demonstration in the capital has been organized for oct .

referring to double suicide bomb attacks that ripped through two buses in the southern israeli town of beersheba on tuesday killing at least 12 people , fischer said that it was clear that " all efforts had to be taken to bring peace and stability in the region . "
the minister said there had to be an end to terror and violence . " the killing of innocent people on both sides is not acceptable , " he added . a respected mediator earlier fischer , on the last leg of his five-day , five-nation middle east visit , held talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak and prime minister ahmed nasif in alexandria , praising egypt 's peace engagement in gaza .
the two sides also discussed ways of reviving the stalled peace process between the israelis and palestinians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , at a hotel in alexandria , egypt .
in addition , fischer also met with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia in alexandria the german foreign minister , a well-respected mediator in the middle east , repeated what he said in jerusalem a day earlier : that the eu wanted israel 's planned pullout in the gaza strip to be part of a us-backed peace plan and thus take place in coordination with the palestinians .
" gaza can mean a significant progress for the peace process , " fischer said . at the same time the minister said the palestinians also had to cooperate to enable israel to execute its pullout . arab-israeli conflict the main issue the ongoing arab-israeli conflict has been the dominant theme of fischer 's talks in all five mideast countries on his itinerary , beginning with lebanon and on to syria , jordan , israel and finally , egypt . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , in damascus on saturday . during talks with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom in jerusalem on monday , fischer made it clear that a pullout in gaza alone would not suffice , but had to be accompanied by similar steps in the west bank .
" this would lead to a breakthrough , and we in germany and the eu are ready to engage ourselves , " fischer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom , right , with gernman foreign minister joschka fischer during their meeting in jerusalem .
at the same time the minister stressed it was important for israel to halt construction of west bank settlements according to terms of the internationally backed " road map " peace plan . fischer has also underlined that the european union remains committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " he said . sharon brings forward gaza pullout on tuesday sharon announced that evacuation of all 21 jewish settlements from gaza is set for the beginning of next year , advancing the controversial pullout schedule by about eight months . under the gaza plan , four of the 120 settlements in the west bank - home to about 240,000 settlers - would also be moved by next year .
but israeli prime minister ariel sharon intends to hold on to an arc of larger enclaves there . israel seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war .
the international community sees jewish settlements built on those territories as illegal , a view israel disputes . european security linked to mideast 's fischer 's mideast trip has been largely viewed symbolically as peace and stability deteriorate while infighting and chaos paralyzes the palestinian authority and israel continues to build a security wall in violation of international norms . but the german foreign minister was also frank and upfront with his mideast hosts . he condemned syrian interference in lebanon , warned damascus to improve its human rights record and agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction , and urged amman to initiate internal reforms .
even fischer 's message to sharon that gaza can only be the beginning of peace is considered a bold move , given that the pullout remains so controversial in israel . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , in amman , jordan on sunday . in jordan on sunday , fischer gave a hint of the reasons behind his unflagging efforts in the search for a solution to the middle east conflict : " when we talk of our security as europeans , we are talking about the future of our neighbors the middle east , " he said in a press conference .
" if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace .

but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.08.2004 lights , mobile phone , action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film art in pocket-sized format gone are the days when mobile phones served just one piffling function : that of a telephone .
they 've long proved to be versatile multimedia gadgets and are now even starring in a short film festival in berlin . a ramshackle volkswagen bus flattens a mobile phone with a sickeningly crunching sound under its tires .
in another variation , a mobile phone is pounded to bits with a golf club or a baseball bat .
that 's how a berlin artist duo demonstrates various death scenarios of mobile phones in a 90-second long sequence - shot with a mobile phone outfitted with video technology . the clip is one of around 150 wildly experimental short films competing for the " micromovie award , " the crowning glory of an international film festival focusing exclusively on films shot with mobile phones .
called " interfilm , " the festival will be debuting in berlin from nov .
2 to nov .
7 . in cooperation with its main sponsor , " interfilm " has provided film schools and producers worldwide with the latest mobile phone generation and is now waiting for applications that have to be sent in to berlin by the end of august . short films from around the world bildunterschrift : " solarium " , a short film by konrad sattler there 's little doubt of the popularity of the project .
packets from around 22 countries have already piled up on heide schürmeier 's desk at the " interfilm " office in berlin .
some bear names such as " vancouver film school , " the " univerdsidad del cine " in buenos aires or the " national institute of design " in india . the latter , in particular , has already sent in nine micromovies despite the fact that the indians were equipped with just two mobile phones .
young indian filmmakers have already cemented the bollywood country 's reputation as a quick-film mecca . working with technical limitations but , though shooting with a mobile phone might sound fun , it is n't exactly easy . " there 's no zoom , the light conditions are different , low storage capacity and just when things begin to get exciting the battery 's empty , " schürmeier said .
" but that 's exactly why it 's so thrilling to see how professionals manage with such limitations . " professor tjark ihmels from the institute for media design at the mainz technical college , whose students have also sent in applications to the " interfilm " festival , remembers how challenging the work was . " they -lrb- the students -rrb- were incredulous at how tiny a camera can be , " ihmels said .
he added that most of his students were unused to working without bulky film equipment . " and as far as the quality loss of the handy cameras go , the word ' handicap ' takes on a whole new meaning , " he added . technologically , filming with a video-capable mobile phone is a nightmare .
quick movements are totally unacceptable to the phones , turning picture sequences into choppy , coarse pixels and playing havoc with the colors . " one has to work with distortion , rework it on the computer and incorporate photo elements , " ihmels said .
this kind of technical mop-up before the 90-second end product is allowed by " interfilm . " ihmels is convinced of the benefits of video-capable mobile phones .

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund is worried an over-aggressive bidder might injure its star tomas rosicky currently ranked eighth in the german premier soccer league , dortmund 's team officials are n't as excited about the auction as their colleagues in hamborn .
they 're afraid someone hardcore enough to spend thousands of euros for a ten-minute appearance might also be willing to injure one of their players .
the hamborn coach said the inclusion of a novice player would be a one-off , and the money would go to a good purpose : the purchase of an artificial turf for the junior league . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " and finally ...

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund is worried an over-aggressive bidder might injure its star tomas rosicky currently ranked eighth in the german premier soccer league , dortmund 's team officials are n't as excited about the auction as their colleagues in hamborn .
they 're afraid someone hardcore enough to spend thousands of euros for a ten-minute appearance might also be willing to injure one of their players .
the hamborn coach said the inclusion of a novice player would be a one-off , and the money would go to a good purpose : the purchase of an artificial turf for the junior league . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " and finally ...

putin and schröder then held informal bilateral talks during the evening with chirac expected to join the discussions early the next morning after an overnight flight from paris . chirac had been forced to delay his arrival owing to the abduction of two french journalists in iraq by kidnappers who have given paris an ultimatum over its ban on the wearing of the muslim headscarf in state schools .
but the french president did not want to cancel the meeting with his two fellow opponents of the us-led invasion of iraq and arrived early on tuesday in the scenic resort . along with iraq , the three leaders were expected to discuss relations between the european union and russia , as well as regional questions , two days after a controversial presidential election in the war-torn russian republic of chechnya . the leaders began the day with a working breakfast , followed by trilateral talks , with officials emphasizing that the meeting was informal , with no fixed agenda and no necessity to take decisions .
the informality was confirmed by the sighting of the trio chatting in english on the veranda of the residence before heading into their talks after breakfast . chirac reiterates stance on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the mini-summit began after islamic militants holding two french journalists captive gave paris another 24 hours to scrap its controversial ban on the wearing in public schools of islamic headscarves and other signs of religious affiliation .
that ban , made law in france earlier this year , was due to go into effect this week and france has asserted that the law safeguards the country 's stringent secular traditions and will stand . chirac reiterated his call for the release of two journalists . " i am renewing my solemn call for their release , " chirac told reporters at the post-talks press conference .
" everything will be done to secure their release . " putin meanwhile faced his own challenges from extremists in the aftermath of apparent suicide bomber attacks that brought down two commercial airliners in russia last week with the loss of 90 lives . two women from russia 's separatist republic of chechnya , where russian forces are mired in a five-year guerrilla war , were suspected of bringing the planes down and putin has ordered law enforcement agencies to take higher precautions against further " terrorist acts " in russia . putin defends elections in chechnya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya is an on-going dirty war on russia 's doorstep .
chechnya would always remain a part of russia , putin said and defended the elections in the state at the weekend which had been widely criticized . " the chechen people have made their choice , " putin told reporters .
" if the chechen people came out to vote , that means they wanted to decide their republic 's future .
no one dragged them by the scruff of their necks or their hair to the voting stations . " the vote was denounced on monday by the united states as falling short of international standards of freedom and fairness and having " serious flaws " .
the european commission on tuesday also condemned the poll and called for early parliamentary polls in the strife-torn russian republic .
putin confirmed that both chirac and schröder questioned him about the war and said he gave them " detailed " answers . schröder calls for political solution schröder revealed to the press conference that he told putin that " the chechen conflict must be resolved politically , the way that putin has said it would , " and added , " we will continue to look for a solution in critical solidarity . " jacques chirac said he supported his russian counterpart vladimir putin in seeking a political solution in chechnya , provided that it preserves russia 's territorial integrity . " a political solution is necessary and this is what russia wants but a political solution has a limit , " chirac said at the press conference .
pledge of support for iraq but no details on the subject of iraq , all three leaders pledged to work toward bringing stability to the war-torn country , but gave no concrete details about what steps they would take . " we have an interest in contributing everything possible to lead to stabilizing the situation , " putin said but failed to elaborate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. army continues to fight battles across iraq .
putin , schröder and chirac have toned down their criticism of the situation in iraq since their opposition before the us-led invasion , but they made clear their concern about the troubled security situation in iraq . all three nations have refused to send troops to iraq to help in peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts .
france and germany have said they would help train iraqi officers but only outside the country , while russia has offered to help train civilian personnel and said it would consider restructuring iraq 's multibillion dollar debt through the paris club of creditor nations .
russia to continue increase in oil production in a further statement , putin announced that russia would continue to increase the extraction and export of its oil resources . russian firms would " continue to increase the extraction of hydrocarbons and that they will increase their deliveries to the global market , " the russian president told assembled press . russian oil production is expected to reach 450 million tons this year and export some 255 million tons , an increase from 421 million tons of production and 228 million tons of exports last year , he added . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads for russian summit the leaders of germany and russia will meet in the black sea resort of sochi on monday to address european relations and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq .

the mini-summit began after islamic militants holding two french journalists captive gave paris another 24 hours to scrap its controversial ban on the wearing in public schools of islamic headscarves and other signs of religious affiliation .
that ban , made law in france earlier this year , was due to go into effect this week and france has asserted that the law safeguards the country 's stringent secular traditions and will stand . chirac reiterated his call for the release of two journalists . " i am renewing my solemn call for their release , " chirac told reporters at the post-talks press conference .
" everything will be done to secure their release . " putin meanwhile faced his own challenges from extremists in the aftermath of apparent suicide bomber attacks that brought down two commercial airliners in russia last week with the loss of 90 lives . two women from russia 's separatist republic of chechnya , where russian forces are mired in a five-year guerrilla war , were suspected of bringing the planes down and putin has ordered law enforcement agencies to take higher precautions against further " terrorist acts " in russia . putin defends elections in chechnya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya is an on-going dirty war on russia 's doorstep .
chechnya would always remain a part of russia , putin said and defended the elections in the state at the weekend which had been widely criticized . " the chechen people have made their choice , " putin told reporters .
" if the chechen people came out to vote , that means they wanted to decide their republic 's future .
no one dragged them by the scruff of their necks or their hair to the voting stations . " the vote was denounced on monday by the united states as falling short of international standards of freedom and fairness and having " serious flaws " .
the european commission on tuesday also condemned the poll and called for early parliamentary polls in the strife-torn russian republic .
putin confirmed that both chirac and schröder questioned him about the war and said he gave them " detailed " answers . schröder calls for political solution schröder revealed to the press conference that he told putin that " the chechen conflict must be resolved politically , the way that putin has said it would , " and added , " we will continue to look for a solution in critical solidarity . " jacques chirac said he supported his russian counterpart vladimir putin in seeking a political solution in chechnya , provided that it preserves russia 's territorial integrity . " a political solution is necessary and this is what russia wants but a political solution has a limit , " chirac said at the press conference .
pledge of support for iraq but no details on the subject of iraq , all three leaders pledged to work toward bringing stability to the war-torn country , but gave no concrete details about what steps they would take . " we have an interest in contributing everything possible to lead to stabilizing the situation , " putin said but failed to elaborate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. army continues to fight battles across iraq .
putin , schröder and chirac have toned down their criticism of the situation in iraq since their opposition before the us-led invasion , but they made clear their concern about the troubled security situation in iraq . all three nations have refused to send troops to iraq to help in peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts .
france and germany have said they would help train iraqi officers but only outside the country , while russia has offered to help train civilian personnel and said it would consider restructuring iraq 's multibillion dollar debt through the paris club of creditor nations .
russia to continue increase in oil production in a further statement , putin announced that russia would continue to increase the extraction and export of its oil resources . russian firms would " continue to increase the extraction of hydrocarbons and that they will increase their deliveries to the global market , " the russian president told assembled press . russian oil production is expected to reach 450 million tons this year and export some 255 million tons , an increase from 421 million tons of production and 228 million tons of exports last year , he added . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads for russian summit the leaders of germany and russia will meet in the black sea resort of sochi on monday to address european relations and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq .

putin and schröder then held informal bilateral talks during the evening with chirac expected to join the discussions early the next morning after an overnight flight from paris . chirac had been forced to delay his arrival owing to the abduction of two french journalists in iraq by kidnappers who have given paris an ultimatum over its ban on the wearing of the muslim headscarf in state schools .

the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .
their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .
their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in a surprising change of opinion , chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- , who last month said a parliamentary vote would ratify the eu constitution in germany , this weekend suggested changing germany 's constitution to allow voters to decide on major issues - with the condition the changes apply to domestic as well as european topics .
" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .
the greens , the ruling coalition 's junior partner , were pleased with the chancellor 's new line , as were the neo-liberal free democrats .
green party head angelika beer said she hopes " the spd 's clear signal " will prompt the opposition to express support for plebiscites .
opposition against domestic plebiscites but while the government would find backing for european votes , it is domestic decisions that conservative opposition parties are against .
without their help the spd does n't have a chance of reaching the two-thirds majority needed for the changes to pass in the bundestag and bundesrat , germany 's two houses of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's laurenz meyer said his party could still change its mind laurenz meyer , the christian democratic union 's secretary general , expressed his party 's " serious concerns " about domestic plebiscites , which are currently only called when the country restructures federal territory .
but he said the last word has n't be spoken until after his party meets wednesday .
political wrangling other cdu members , however , were less reserved , calling the chancellor 's change of direction nothing but politics as usual .
" it 's a tactical trick , " matthias wissmann , chair of the cdu 's european committee , told the berliner zeitung .
" the spd hopes for enough resistance among its own party and in the opposition that the suggestion does n't find the needed majority and can say ' well , we tried . " '
resistance to voter-determined domestic decisions also came from the christian social union , but markus söder , that party 's secretary general , said letting voters decide whether to accept major changes to european law would ensure germans are aware of how they are affected by brussels decisions .
timely decision but some spd members said it was more important to ratify the eu constitution quickly than to spend time trying to introduce referendums in germany .
angelica schwall-düren , the spd 's deputy chair , said she did n't think the time was right for german constitutional changes , referring to a failed attempt to introduce referendums two years ago .
so far a total of 10 nations , including france and britain , have decided to hold referendums on the european constitution .
the constitution will only be enacted if it is ratified by all 25 of the bloc 's member states . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in a surprising change of opinion , chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- , who last month said a parliamentary vote would ratify the eu constitution in germany , this weekend suggested changing germany 's constitution to allow voters to decide on major issues - with the condition the changes apply to domestic as well as european topics .
" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .
the greens , the ruling coalition 's junior partner , were pleased with the chancellor 's new line , as were the neo-liberal free democrats .
green party head angelika beer said she hopes " the spd 's clear signal " will prompt the opposition to express support for plebiscites .
opposition against domestic plebiscites but while the government would find backing for european votes , it is domestic decisions that conservative opposition parties are against .
without their help the spd does n't have a chance of reaching the two-thirds majority needed for the changes to pass in the bundestag and bundesrat , germany 's two houses of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's laurenz meyer said his party could still change its mind laurenz meyer , the christian democratic union 's secretary general , expressed his party 's " serious concerns " about domestic plebiscites , which are currently only called when the country restructures federal territory .
but he said the last word has n't be spoken until after his party meets wednesday .
political wrangling other cdu members , however , were less reserved , calling the chancellor 's change of direction nothing but politics as usual .
" it 's a tactical trick , " matthias wissmann , chair of the cdu 's european committee , told the berliner zeitung .
" the spd hopes for enough resistance among its own party and in the opposition that the suggestion does n't find the needed majority and can say ' well , we tried . " '
resistance to voter-determined domestic decisions also came from the christian social union , but markus söder , that party 's secretary general , said letting voters decide whether to accept major changes to european law would ensure germans are aware of how they are affected by brussels decisions .
timely decision but some spd members said it was more important to ratify the eu constitution quickly than to spend time trying to introduce referendums in germany .
angelica schwall-düren , the spd 's deputy chair , said she did n't think the time was right for german constitutional changes , referring to a failed attempt to introduce referendums two years ago .
so far a total of 10 nations , including france and britain , have decided to hold referendums on the european constitution .
the constitution will only be enacted if it is ratified by all 25 of the bloc 's member states . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics .

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .

the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .
the move angered berlin , which contends disciplinary proceedings are only warranted against countries that are being uncooperative on the budgetary issues . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .
the move angered berlin , which contends disciplinary proceedings are only warranted against countries that are being uncooperative on the budgetary issues . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

referring to double suicide bomb attacks that ripped through two buses in the southern israeli town of beersheba on tuesday killing at least 12 people , fischer said that it was clear that " all efforts had to be taken to bring peace and stability in the region . "
the minister said there had to be an end to terror and violence . " the killing of innocent people on both sides is not acceptable , " he added . a respected mediator earlier fischer , on the last leg of his five-day , five-nation middle east visit , held talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak and prime minister ahmed nasif in alexandria , praising egypt 's peace engagement in gaza .
the two sides also discussed ways of reviving the stalled peace process between the israelis and palestinians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , at a hotel in alexandria , egypt .
in addition , fischer also met with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia in alexandria the german foreign minister , a well-respected mediator in the middle east , repeated what he said in jerusalem a day earlier : that the eu wanted israel 's planned pullout in the gaza strip to be part of a us-backed peace plan and thus take place in coordination with the palestinians .
" gaza can mean a significant progress for the peace process , " fischer said . at the same time the minister said the palestinians also had to cooperate to enable israel to execute its pullout . arab-israeli conflict the main issue the ongoing arab-israeli conflict has been the dominant theme of fischer 's talks in all five mideast countries on his itinerary , beginning with lebanon and on to syria , jordan , israel and finally , egypt . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , in damascus on saturday . during talks with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom in jerusalem on monday , fischer made it clear that a pullout in gaza alone would not suffice , but had to be accompanied by similar steps in the west bank .
" this would lead to a breakthrough , and we in germany and the eu are ready to engage ourselves , " fischer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom , right , with gernman foreign minister joschka fischer during their meeting in jerusalem .
at the same time the minister stressed it was important for israel to halt construction of west bank settlements according to terms of the internationally backed " road map " peace plan . fischer has also underlined that the european union remains committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " he said . sharon brings forward gaza pullout on tuesday sharon announced that evacuation of all 21 jewish settlements from gaza is set for the beginning of next year , advancing the controversial pullout schedule by about eight months . under the gaza plan , four of the 120 settlements in the west bank - home to about 240,000 settlers - would also be moved by next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.08.2004 lights , mobile phone , action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film art in pocket-sized format gone are the days when mobile phones served just one piffling function : that of a telephone .
they 've long proved to be versatile multimedia gadgets and are now even starring in a short film festival in berlin . a ramshackle volkswagen bus flattens a mobile phone with a sickeningly crunching sound under its tires .
in another variation , a mobile phone is pounded to bits with a golf club or a baseball bat .
that 's how a berlin artist duo demonstrates various death scenarios of mobile phones in a 90-second long sequence - shot with a mobile phone outfitted with video technology . the clip is one of around 150 wildly experimental short films competing for the " micromovie award , " the crowning glory of an international film festival focusing exclusively on films shot with mobile phones .
called " interfilm , " the festival will be debuting in berlin from nov .
2 to nov .
7 . in cooperation with its main sponsor , " interfilm " has provided film schools and producers worldwide with the latest mobile phone generation and is now waiting for applications that have to be sent in to berlin by the end of august . short films from around the world bildunterschrift : " solarium " , a short film by konrad sattler there 's little doubt of the popularity of the project .
packets from around 22 countries have already piled up on heide schürmeier 's desk at the " interfilm " office in berlin .
some bear names such as " vancouver film school , " the " univerdsidad del cine " in buenos aires or the " national institute of design " in india . the latter , in particular , has already sent in nine micromovies despite the fact that the indians were equipped with just two mobile phones .
young indian filmmakers have already cemented the bollywood country 's reputation as a quick-film mecca . working with technical limitations but , though shooting with a mobile phone might sound fun , it is n't exactly easy . " there 's no zoom , the light conditions are different , low storage capacity and just when things begin to get exciting the battery 's empty , " schürmeier said .
" but that 's exactly why it 's so thrilling to see how professionals manage with such limitations . " professor tjark ihmels from the institute for media design at the mainz technical college , whose students have also sent in applications to the " interfilm " festival , remembers how challenging the work was . " they -lrb- the students -rrb- were incredulous at how tiny a camera can be , " ihmels said .
he added that most of his students were unused to working without bulky film equipment . " and as far as the quality loss of the handy cameras go , the word ' handicap ' takes on a whole new meaning , " he added . technologically , filming with a video-capable mobile phone is a nightmare .
quick movements are totally unacceptable to the phones , turning picture sequences into choppy , coarse pixels and playing havoc with the colors . " one has to work with distortion , rework it on the computer and incorporate photo elements , " ihmels said .
this kind of technical mop-up before the 90-second end product is allowed by " interfilm . " ihmels is convinced of the benefits of video-capable mobile phones .
he said the greatest art in the making of the mobile phone films was to exploit the technical weaknesses . " then one can aesthetically produce serious beauties , " he said .
" one can be more spontaneous and people also move more freely , more authentically . " on the data protection radar but this freedom of shooting people and things so freely - with the pocket-sized camera allowed almost everywhere and the subtle click on the release button going mostly unobserved - has already attracted the attention of data protection authorities .
" a pirated copy of the facts " is what the " interfilm " crew calls it . but so far voyeuristic short films still have n't reached heide schürmeier . " maybe it contradicts the professional ethos of the filmmakers , " is how she explains it . but ihmels believes there 's another reason behind it . " they 're aware of the legal consequences of secret filming , " he said . currently the " interfilm " team are selecting the 20 best applications , which can be viewed on the internet at the beginning of october .
in november , spectators can then vote which mobile phone film wins the € 3,000 endowed " micromovie award . " however , they 'll have to crowd around a small computer monitor to do that because despite all the technological sophistication , the graphic resolution of the " micromovies " does n't suffice for a large silver screen . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nokia 's jetset mobile : it blings and rings five years ago mobile phones were the latest rage .
today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu .

it added that the private sphere of prominent persons in germany was not adequately protected and that press freedom was given priority at the cost of privacy . " journalists will be muzzled " the european court of human rights also ruled that public figures would have to give their consent before the publication of material about their private lives - both pictures and the written word - could be permitted . journalists and editors fear that the decision will have major consequences for german media as a whole . " if the german government does n't appeal the judgment then it would mean that all serious journalists will be muzzled , " monday 's open letter to the chancellor read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors in germany fear that the freedom of the press is under siege following the european court of human rights ruling in june .
the editors , from newsmagazines spiegel , focus , stern and leading mass-circulation daily bild among others , said they were concerned that the european court of human rights decision meant that prominent people could in future determine what was reported about them .
" with that , the most important duty of the press - to closely watch the powerful - will be massively hindered , " they said in the letter . separately , the chairman of public broadcaster ard , jobst plog , and the head of public broadcaster zdf , markus schächter , sent a joint letter to german justice minister brigitte zypries , stressing they would " strongly welcomed " the government appealing the european court judgment .
" there are fears that this special case will result in unregulated general restrictions for future picture reporting , " they wrote . earlier decision overruled the june 24th decision by the european court of human rights overruled a 1999 decision in the same case by germany 's constitutional court . the german court had ruled that , as a " person of contemporary history , " caroline would have to accept that photos of her in publicly accessible places could be published without her permission .
with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children , the german constitutional court dismissed her claim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias prinz , princess caroline 's lawyer , speaks to journalists in june .
caroline 's lawyers , who argued that her children were constantly being followed and that photographers frequently staked out their schools , took the case to the european court of human rights . the judges in strasbourg said the german verdict contradicted the right to respect for private and family life , anchored in the european convention on human rights . a hard blow for democracy the german editors protesting the ruling say , however , that as it stands , the decision would only permit reporting on public figures in their public role .
how these people behave , who their business contacts are or who pays for their holidays would go unreported , according to the newsmen . the editors also listed major domestic german news stories that would not have seen the light of day under the new ruling .
they include the perks scandal which led to the resignation of the previous head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , and the investment activities of the former head of germany 's powerful metal workers ' union , franz steinkühler . late last week the german association of newspaper publishers publicly voiced their unease .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 14 years of german unification opinion : a progress report on german unity dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules solbes blames reunification for german economic woes communism sunk by the hunk in trunks ? germany -pipe- 31.08.2004 a new east-west divide in germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- joined the protests on monday more marches against the hartz iv welfare reforms took place on monday .
again the focus was on the east of germany where anger is growing and discontent over conditions in the former communist states is rife . the protests against the german government 's planned welfare cuts entered their fifth week on monday as tens of thousands of germans once again took to the streets of cities across the country to demonstrate . but while chancellor gerhard schröder attempted to appease the nation by reiterating his message that the " hartz iv " reforms would go through for the benefit of germany , a number of politicians and media warned of growing divisions related to the expected effects of the welfare cuts between the former communist eastern germany and the more prosperous west . the proposed cuts to unemployment benefit , a tactic that the chancellor assures will keep the welfare system affordable for an ageing population , are likely to hit the eastern states of germany hardest where unemployment rates are running at nearly 20 percent , twice the level in the more affluent west .
most demonstrations have taken place in eastern cities , with the most vociferous protests once again happening in berlin , leipzig and magdeburg . even former finance minister oskar lafontaine , a long-time political sparring partner of schröder , experienced the growing distaste for anything and anybody attached to the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and was welcomed with whistles and even an egg from a roughly 20,000-strong crowd in leipzig .
despite coming to the platform with an anti-reform message , lafontaine , who is a member of the sdp with strong links to the left , found less support than expected in the crowd .
he called for " an alternative policy of reform " and for a " growth program so that jobs can be created " but the presence of a man rumored to be preparing to form a new political party with other disenchanted spd members divided as much as united the protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eggs and abuse came schröder 's way during last week 's visit to the east .
it is a sign of the massive task the spd has to placate the disenchanted people of the east .
schröder has struggled to get his message across in the region and has faced angry and potentially volatile protests with eggs and abuse hurled at the chancellor 's direction only last week as he visited leipzig and wittenberg . west is more supportive of reforms figures from the federal statistics office show that the chancellor 's proposed reforms are creating a distinctive east / west division in opinion , with more westerners than easterners supporting " hartz iv , " which will cut benefit for many long-term unemployed and set tougher conditions on claimants , introducing stricter means testing to encourage jobless people to take work of any kind . it appears that in the east , where the former communist regime guaranteed a job for almost everybody , the idea of welfare cuts have released bottled-up frustration that after more than a decade of reunification , many feel worse off than before . just 39 percent of east germans happy with schröder 's brand of democratic leadership , compared with 63 percent in the west .
many in the east have begun to fear they will slide into poverty when the benefit cuts take effect in january and that communist rule now does n't seem so bad . dormant unease has found a release valve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this creeping sense of unease in the eastern states has not really been registered either in the media or by political representatives , " franz walter , a political researcher at göttingen university , told the bremen regional newspaper kurier am sonntag : " so these radical and uncontrolled protests were only a matter of time . " the people of the east will get a different opportunity to voice their protests on sept .
19 when they go to the polls in regional elections in the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg .
the ruling social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- are expected to lose ground heavily to the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the former east german communist party .
schröder has accused pds officials of hijacking the reform debate . the chancellor 's not for turning but the chancellor , well aware of the damage a pounding in the state elections would do to the sdp 's credibility nationwide , remains unrepentant .
the reforms , he repeats , will not be watered down and discussing the reforms is not a sign that his resolve is weakening . " showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears ... does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " he said before a party meeting . before the elections take place , more demonstrations are expected .
while the actual numbers of protestors are reported to be less each week , the organizers of the marches have said that the protests for the fifth " monday demonstration " had spread to 202 cities , up from 140 a week ago .
a spokesman for the berlin protesters claimed that more than 200,000 joined the nationwide marches on monday and added that a national demonstration in the capital has been organized for oct .

" milosevic , who is acting as his own lawyer , told the court that he needed more than the 150 days allotted to him to cross-examine more than 1,600 witnesses whom he has said he intends to call to the stand . rejecting the prosecution 's claim that he masterminded the bloody wars that tore apart the yugoslav federation in the early 1990s , he said in his opening defence statement that the international community was " the main force for the destruction " of the country . he also blamed " the nato pact " for the conflict in kosovo , a province of his native serbia , where more than 10,000 people died and about 800,000 ethnic albanians - one-third of the population - were expelled in 1988 and 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of u.n. officals watch a burning serbian house in the serb village of svinjare , south of kosovska mitrovica , saturday march 20 , 2004 .
all of the 130 houses as well as the orthodox cemetery in the village have been looted and burnt by ethnic albanians who attacked the village .
milosevic faces a total of 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the 1991-95 war in croatia , the 1992-95 war in bosnia and the kosovo campaign .
he has also been charged with genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the war in bosnia , which left 200,000 people dead .

"
but " friends of the court " - lawyers appointed to ensure milosevic gets a fair trial - have warned that it would only add more stress if he were forced to take on a defense lawyer against his will . milosevic said during a procedural hearing that he planned to call british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton as witnesses .

it added that the private sphere of prominent persons in germany was not adequately protected and that press freedom was given priority at the cost of privacy . " journalists will be muzzled " the european court of human rights also ruled that public figures would have to give their consent before the publication of material about their private lives - both pictures and the written word - could be permitted . journalists and editors fear that the decision will have major consequences for german media as a whole . " if the german government does n't appeal the judgment then it would mean that all serious journalists will be muzzled , " monday 's open letter to the chancellor read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors in germany fear that the freedom of the press is under siege following the european court of human rights ruling in june .
the editors , from newsmagazines spiegel , focus , stern and leading mass-circulation daily bild among others , said they were concerned that the european court of human rights decision meant that prominent people could in future determine what was reported about them .
" with that , the most important duty of the press - to closely watch the powerful - will be massively hindered , " they said in the letter . separately , the chairman of public broadcaster ard , jobst plog , and the head of public broadcaster zdf , markus schächter , sent a joint letter to german justice minister brigitte zypries , stressing they would " strongly welcomed " the government appealing the european court judgment .
" there are fears that this special case will result in unregulated general restrictions for future picture reporting , " they wrote . earlier decision overruled the june 24th decision by the european court of human rights overruled a 1999 decision in the same case by germany 's constitutional court . the german court had ruled that , as a " person of contemporary history , " caroline would have to accept that photos of her in publicly accessible places could be published without her permission .
with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children , the german constitutional court dismissed her claim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias prinz , princess caroline 's lawyer , speaks to journalists in june .
caroline 's lawyers , who argued that her children were constantly being followed and that photographers frequently staked out their schools , took the case to the european court of human rights . the judges in strasbourg said the german verdict contradicted the right to respect for private and family life , anchored in the european convention on human rights . a hard blow for democracy the german editors protesting the ruling say , however , that as it stands , the decision would only permit reporting on public figures in their public role .
how these people behave , who their business contacts are or who pays for their holidays would go unreported , according to the newsmen . the editors also listed major domestic german news stories that would not have seen the light of day under the new ruling .
they include the perks scandal which led to the resignation of the previous head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , and the investment activities of the former head of germany 's powerful metal workers ' union , franz steinkühler . late last week the german association of newspaper publishers publicly voiced their unease .
an industry spokesman said that , if left unchallenged , the ruling would mark a hard blow for democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the media chiefs have also pointed out that the german government has only four weeks left to contest the european court 's ruling . a government spokesman said chancellor schröder was still considering the legal aspects of the case before deciding on the matter . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paparazzi ruling could restrict german tabloids princess caroline of monaco won her case against german tabloids at the european court of human rights .

" milosevic , who is acting as his own lawyer , told the court that he needed more than the 150 days allotted to him to cross-examine more than 1,600 witnesses whom he has said he intends to call to the stand . rejecting the prosecution 's claim that he masterminded the bloody wars that tore apart the yugoslav federation in the early 1990s , he said in his opening defence statement that the international community was " the main force for the destruction " of the country . he also blamed " the nato pact " for the conflict in kosovo , a province of his native serbia , where more than 10,000 people died and about 800,000 ethnic albanians - one-third of the population - were expelled in 1988 and 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of u.n. officals watch a burning serbian house in the serb village of svinjare , south of kosovska mitrovica , saturday march 20 , 2004 .
all of the 130 houses as well as the orthodox cemetery in the village have been looted and burnt by ethnic albanians who attacked the village .
milosevic faces a total of 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the 1991-95 war in croatia , the 1992-95 war in bosnia and the kosovo campaign .
he has also been charged with genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the war in bosnia , which left 200,000 people dead .
he faces a life sentence if convicted . dressed in his customary dark blue suit and a red , blue and white striped tie - the colors of the yugoslav flag - the 63-year-old former president told the three-judge tribunal : " in the international public for a long time an untruthful and distorted picture was created about what happened in yugoslavia .
the accusations against me are unscrupulous lies . " milosevic was given four hours to present the outlines of his defense case but he said he would need two days . " i would like to note that the other side -lrb- the prosecution -rrb- got three days to present their opening statement , " he told the court . health concerns after milosevic completes his opening statement , the judges are expected to hold a procedural hearing to discuss his health problems , which have caused his trial to be adjourned 14 times since it began in february 2002 . the prosecution has urged the court to appoint a defense lawyer to act for milosevic , who they accuse of " hijacking the trial to his agenda while stopping just short of obstructionism . "
but " friends of the court " - lawyers appointed to ensure milosevic gets a fair trial - have warned that it would only add more stress if he were forced to take on a defense lawyer against his will . milosevic said during a procedural hearing that he planned to call british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton as witnesses .
his advisors have confirmed only that former greek prime minister constantine mitsotakis and his former russian counterpart , yevgeny primakov , would be called to testify .
the first defence witness will be called on sept .
7 but the court has not revealed who it will be . referring to the kosovo conflict , where the prosecution alleges that milosevic was individually responsible for " the campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians " , he said the real aggressors were " the nato pact . " he also blamed the conflict on " external forces " which worked with " ustasha extremists -lrb- croat nationalists -rrb- , islamic fundamentalists and albanian terrorists whose role was to be the detonator of the conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2004 germans mull vote on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public is n't likely to be voting on the eu constitution the ruling social democratic party 's plan to alter the constitution and introduce plebiscites to the german political scene was quickly rejected by opposition parties , but debate may not be over yet . after months of discussion , the issue of who should vote on what and how has come to the forefront as german leaders ponder whether to approve the new constitution for the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in a surprising change of opinion , chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- , who last month said a parliamentary vote would ratify the eu constitution in germany , this weekend suggested changing germany 's constitution to allow voters to decide on major issues - with the condition the changes apply to domestic as well as european topics .
" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .
the greens , the ruling coalition 's junior partner , were pleased with the chancellor 's new line , as were the neo-liberal free democrats .
green party head angelika beer said she hopes " the spd 's clear signal " will prompt the opposition to express support for plebiscites .
opposition against domestic plebiscites but while the government would find backing for european votes , it is domestic decisions that conservative opposition parties are against .
without their help the spd does n't have a chance of reaching the two-thirds majority needed for the changes to pass in the bundestag and bundesrat , germany 's two houses of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's laurenz meyer said his party could still change its mind laurenz meyer , the christian democratic union 's secretary general , expressed his party 's " serious concerns " about domestic plebiscites , which are currently only called when the country restructures federal territory .
but he said the last word has n't be spoken until after his party meets wednesday .
political wrangling other cdu members , however , were less reserved , calling the chancellor 's change of direction nothing but politics as usual .
" it 's a tactical trick , " matthias wissmann , chair of the cdu 's european committee , told the berliner zeitung .
" the spd hopes for enough resistance among its own party and in the opposition that the suggestion does n't find the needed majority and can say ' well , we tried . " '
resistance to voter-determined domestic decisions also came from the christian social union , but markus söder , that party 's secretary general , said letting voters decide whether to accept major changes to european law would ensure germans are aware of how they are affected by brussels decisions .
timely decision but some spd members said it was more important to ratify the eu constitution quickly than to spend time trying to introduce referendums in germany .
angelica schwall-düren , the spd 's deputy chair , said she did n't think the time was right for german constitutional changes , referring to a failed attempt to introduce referendums two years ago .
so far a total of 10 nations , including france and britain , have decided to hold referendums on the european constitution .
the constitution will only be enacted if it is ratified by all 25 of the bloc 's member states . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics .

the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .
their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .
their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

putin and schröder then held informal bilateral talks during the evening with chirac expected to join the discussions early the next morning after an overnight flight from paris . chirac had been forced to delay his arrival owing to the abduction of two french journalists in iraq by kidnappers who have given paris an ultimatum over its ban on the wearing of the muslim headscarf in state schools .
but the french president did not want to cancel the meeting with his two fellow opponents of the us-led invasion of iraq and arrived early on tuesday in the scenic resort . along with iraq , the three leaders were expected to discuss relations between the european union and russia , as well as regional questions , two days after a controversial presidential election in the war-torn russian republic of chechnya . the leaders began the day with a working breakfast , followed by trilateral talks , with officials emphasizing that the meeting was informal , with no fixed agenda and no necessity to take decisions .
the informality was confirmed by the sighting of the trio chatting in english on the veranda of the residence before heading into their talks after breakfast . chirac reiterates stance on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the mini-summit began after islamic militants holding two french journalists captive gave paris another 24 hours to scrap its controversial ban on the wearing in public schools of islamic headscarves and other signs of religious affiliation .
that ban , made law in france earlier this year , was due to go into effect this week and france has asserted that the law safeguards the country 's stringent secular traditions and will stand . chirac reiterated his call for the release of two journalists . " i am renewing my solemn call for their release , " chirac told reporters at the post-talks press conference .
" everything will be done to secure their release . " putin meanwhile faced his own challenges from extremists in the aftermath of apparent suicide bomber attacks that brought down two commercial airliners in russia last week with the loss of 90 lives . two women from russia 's separatist republic of chechnya , where russian forces are mired in a five-year guerrilla war , were suspected of bringing the planes down and putin has ordered law enforcement agencies to take higher precautions against further " terrorist acts " in russia . putin defends elections in chechnya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya is an on-going dirty war on russia 's doorstep .
chechnya would always remain a part of russia , putin said and defended the elections in the state at the weekend which had been widely criticized . " the chechen people have made their choice , " putin told reporters .
" if the chechen people came out to vote , that means they wanted to decide their republic 's future .
no one dragged them by the scruff of their necks or their hair to the voting stations . " the vote was denounced on monday by the united states as falling short of international standards of freedom and fairness and having " serious flaws " .
the european commission on tuesday also condemned the poll and called for early parliamentary polls in the strife-torn russian republic .
putin confirmed that both chirac and schröder questioned him about the war and said he gave them " detailed " answers . schröder calls for political solution schröder revealed to the press conference that he told putin that " the chechen conflict must be resolved politically , the way that putin has said it would , " and added , " we will continue to look for a solution in critical solidarity . " jacques chirac said he supported his russian counterpart vladimir putin in seeking a political solution in chechnya , provided that it preserves russia 's territorial integrity . " a political solution is necessary and this is what russia wants but a political solution has a limit , " chirac said at the press conference .
pledge of support for iraq but no details on the subject of iraq , all three leaders pledged to work toward bringing stability to the war-torn country , but gave no concrete details about what steps they would take . " we have an interest in contributing everything possible to lead to stabilizing the situation , " putin said but failed to elaborate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. army continues to fight battles across iraq .
putin , schröder and chirac have toned down their criticism of the situation in iraq since their opposition before the us-led invasion , but they made clear their concern about the troubled security situation in iraq . all three nations have refused to send troops to iraq to help in peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts .
france and germany have said they would help train iraqi officers but only outside the country , while russia has offered to help train civilian personnel and said it would consider restructuring iraq 's multibillion dollar debt through the paris club of creditor nations .
russia to continue increase in oil production in a further statement , putin announced that russia would continue to increase the extraction and export of its oil resources . russian firms would " continue to increase the extraction of hydrocarbons and that they will increase their deliveries to the global market , " the russian president told assembled press . russian oil production is expected to reach 450 million tons this year and export some 255 million tons , an increase from 421 million tons of production and 228 million tons of exports last year , he added . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads for russian summit the leaders of germany and russia will meet in the black sea resort of sochi on monday to address european relations and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq .

putin and schröder then held informal bilateral talks during the evening with chirac expected to join the discussions early the next morning after an overnight flight from paris . chirac had been forced to delay his arrival owing to the abduction of two french journalists in iraq by kidnappers who have given paris an ultimatum over its ban on the wearing of the muslim headscarf in state schools .
but the french president did not want to cancel the meeting with his two fellow opponents of the us-led invasion of iraq and arrived early on tuesday in the scenic resort . along with iraq , the three leaders were expected to discuss relations between the european union and russia , as well as regional questions , two days after a controversial presidential election in the war-torn russian republic of chechnya . the leaders began the day with a working breakfast , followed by trilateral talks , with officials emphasizing that the meeting was informal , with no fixed agenda and no necessity to take decisions .
the informality was confirmed by the sighting of the trio chatting in english on the veranda of the residence before heading into their talks after breakfast . chirac reiterates stance on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the mini-summit began after islamic militants holding two french journalists captive gave paris another 24 hours to scrap its controversial ban on the wearing in public schools of islamic headscarves and other signs of religious affiliation .
that ban , made law in france earlier this year , was due to go into effect this week and france has asserted that the law safeguards the country 's stringent secular traditions and will stand . chirac reiterated his call for the release of two journalists . " i am renewing my solemn call for their release , " chirac told reporters at the post-talks press conference .
" everything will be done to secure their release . " putin meanwhile faced his own challenges from extremists in the aftermath of apparent suicide bomber attacks that brought down two commercial airliners in russia last week with the loss of 90 lives . two women from russia 's separatist republic of chechnya , where russian forces are mired in a five-year guerrilla war , were suspected of bringing the planes down and putin has ordered law enforcement agencies to take higher precautions against further " terrorist acts " in russia . putin defends elections in chechnya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya is an on-going dirty war on russia 's doorstep .
chechnya would always remain a part of russia , putin said and defended the elections in the state at the weekend which had been widely criticized . " the chechen people have made their choice , " putin told reporters .
" if the chechen people came out to vote , that means they wanted to decide their republic 's future .
no one dragged them by the scruff of their necks or their hair to the voting stations . " the vote was denounced on monday by the united states as falling short of international standards of freedom and fairness and having " serious flaws " .
the european commission on tuesday also condemned the poll and called for early parliamentary polls in the strife-torn russian republic .
putin confirmed that both chirac and schröder questioned him about the war and said he gave them " detailed " answers . schröder calls for political solution schröder revealed to the press conference that he told putin that " the chechen conflict must be resolved politically , the way that putin has said it would , " and added , " we will continue to look for a solution in critical solidarity . " jacques chirac said he supported his russian counterpart vladimir putin in seeking a political solution in chechnya , provided that it preserves russia 's territorial integrity .

putin , schröder and chirac have toned down their criticism of the situation in iraq since their opposition before the us-led invasion , but they made clear their concern about the troubled security situation in iraq . all three nations have refused to send troops to iraq to help in peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts .
france and germany have said they would help train iraqi officers but only outside the country , while russia has offered to help train civilian personnel and said it would consider restructuring iraq 's multibillion dollar debt through the paris club of creditor nations .
russia to continue increase in oil production in a further statement , putin announced that russia would continue to increase the extraction and export of its oil resources . russian firms would " continue to increase the extraction of hydrocarbons and that they will increase their deliveries to the global market , " the russian president told assembled press . russian oil production is expected to reach 450 million tons this year and export some 255 million tons , an increase from 421 million tons of production and 228 million tons of exports last year , he added . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads for russian summit the leaders of germany and russia will meet in the black sea resort of sochi on monday to address european relations and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq .

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .

" milosevic , who is acting as his own lawyer , told the court that he needed more than the 150 days allotted to him to cross-examine more than 1,600 witnesses whom he has said he intends to call to the stand . rejecting the prosecution 's claim that he masterminded the bloody wars that tore apart the yugoslav federation in the early 1990s , he said in his opening defence statement that the international community was " the main force for the destruction " of the country . he also blamed " the nato pact " for the conflict in kosovo , a province of his native serbia , where more than 10,000 people died and about 800,000 ethnic albanians - one-third of the population - were expelled in 1988 and 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of u.n. officals watch a burning serbian house in the serb village of svinjare , south of kosovska mitrovica , saturday march 20 , 2004 .

milosevic faces a total of 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the 1991-95 war in croatia , the 1992-95 war in bosnia and the kosovo campaign .
he has also been charged with genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the war in bosnia , which left 200,000 people dead .

"
but " friends of the court " - lawyers appointed to ensure milosevic gets a fair trial - have warned that it would only add more stress if he were forced to take on a defense lawyer against his will . milosevic said during a procedural hearing that he planned to call british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton as witnesses .
his advisors have confirmed only that former greek prime minister constantine mitsotakis and his former russian counterpart , yevgeny primakov , would be called to testify .
the first defence witness will be called on sept .

he has also been charged with genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the war in bosnia , which left 200,000 people dead .
he faces a life sentence if convicted . dressed in his customary dark blue suit and a red , blue and white striped tie - the colors of the yugoslav flag - the 63-year-old former president told the three-judge tribunal : " in the international public for a long time an untruthful and distorted picture was created about what happened in yugoslavia .

" i would like to note that the other side -lrb- the prosecution -rrb- got three days to present their opening statement , " he told the court . health concerns after milosevic completes his opening statement , the judges are expected to hold a procedural hearing to discuss his health problems , which have caused his trial to be adjourned 14 times since it began in february 2002 . the prosecution has urged the court to appoint a defense lawyer to act for milosevic , who they accuse of " hijacking the trial to his agenda while stopping just short of obstructionism . "
but " friends of the court " - lawyers appointed to ensure milosevic gets a fair trial - have warned that it would only add more stress if he were forced to take on a defense lawyer against his will . milosevic said during a procedural hearing that he planned to call british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton as witnesses .
his advisors have confirmed only that former greek prime minister constantine mitsotakis and his former russian counterpart , yevgeny primakov , would be called to testify .
the first defence witness will be called on sept .

" he also blamed the conflict on " external forces " which worked with " ustasha extremists -lrb- croat nationalists -rrb- , islamic fundamentalists and albanian terrorists whose role was to be the detonator of the conflict .

the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .

they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .
their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

putin and schröder then held informal bilateral talks during the evening with chirac expected to join the discussions early the next morning after an overnight flight from paris . chirac had been forced to delay his arrival owing to the abduction of two french journalists in iraq by kidnappers who have given paris an ultimatum over its ban on the wearing of the muslim headscarf in state schools .
but the french president did not want to cancel the meeting with his two fellow opponents of the us-led invasion of iraq and arrived early on tuesday in the scenic resort . along with iraq , the three leaders were expected to discuss relations between the european union and russia , as well as regional questions , two days after a controversial presidential election in the war-torn russian republic of chechnya . the leaders began the day with a working breakfast , followed by trilateral talks , with officials emphasizing that the meeting was informal , with no fixed agenda and no necessity to take decisions .
the informality was confirmed by the sighting of the trio chatting in english on the veranda of the residence before heading into their talks after breakfast . chirac reiterates stance on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the mini-summit began after islamic militants holding two french journalists captive gave paris another 24 hours to scrap its controversial ban on the wearing in public schools of islamic headscarves and other signs of religious affiliation .

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund is worried an over-aggressive bidder might injure its star tomas rosicky currently ranked eighth in the german premier soccer league , dortmund 's team officials are n't as excited about the auction as their colleagues in hamborn .
they 're afraid someone hardcore enough to spend thousands of euros for a ten-minute appearance might also be willing to injure one of their players .
the hamborn coach said the inclusion of a novice player would be a one-off , and the money would go to a good purpose : the purchase of an artificial turf for the junior league . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " and finally ...

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .

they 're afraid someone hardcore enough to spend thousands of euros for a ten-minute appearance might also be willing to injure one of their players .

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund is worried an over-aggressive bidder might injure its star tomas rosicky currently ranked eighth in the german premier soccer league , dortmund 's team officials are n't as excited about the auction as their colleagues in hamborn .
they 're afraid someone hardcore enough to spend thousands of euros for a ten-minute appearance might also be willing to injure one of their players .
the hamborn coach said the inclusion of a novice player would be a one-off , and the money would go to a good purpose : the purchase of an artificial turf for the junior league . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " and finally ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off negotiations at opel continue opinion : blame the managers , not the country business -pipe- 31.08.2004 germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel said germany would stay in the red this year german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .
the move angered berlin , which contends disciplinary proceedings are only warranted against countries that are being uncooperative on the budgetary issues . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .
the move angered berlin , which contends disciplinary proceedings are only warranted against countries that are being uncooperative on the budgetary issues . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .

referring to double suicide bomb attacks that ripped through two buses in the southern israeli town of beersheba on tuesday killing at least 12 people , fischer said that it was clear that " all efforts had to be taken to bring peace and stability in the region . "
the minister said there had to be an end to terror and violence .

it added that the private sphere of prominent persons in germany was not adequately protected and that press freedom was given priority at the cost of privacy . " journalists will be muzzled " the european court of human rights also ruled that public figures would have to give their consent before the publication of material about their private lives - both pictures and the written word - could be permitted . journalists and editors fear that the decision will have major consequences for german media as a whole . " if the german government does n't appeal the judgment then it would mean that all serious journalists will be muzzled , " monday 's open letter to the chancellor read . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : editors in germany fear that the freedom of the press is under siege following the european court of human rights ruling in june .
the editors , from newsmagazines spiegel , focus , stern and leading mass-circulation daily bild among others , said they were concerned that the european court of human rights decision meant that prominent people could in future determine what was reported about them .
" with that , the most important duty of the press - to closely watch the powerful - will be massively hindered , " they said in the letter . separately , the chairman of public broadcaster ard , jobst plog , and the head of public broadcaster zdf , markus schächter , sent a joint letter to german justice minister brigitte zypries , stressing they would " strongly welcomed " the government appealing the european court judgment .
" there are fears that this special case will result in unregulated general restrictions for future picture reporting , " they wrote . earlier decision overruled the june 24th decision by the european court of human rights overruled a 1999 decision in the same case by germany 's constitutional court . the german court had ruled that , as a " person of contemporary history , " caroline would have to accept that photos of her in publicly accessible places could be published without her permission .
with the exception of the photographs in which she appeared with her children , the german constitutional court dismissed her claim . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthias prinz , princess caroline 's lawyer , speaks to journalists in june .
caroline 's lawyers , who argued that her children were constantly being followed and that photographers frequently staked out their schools , took the case to the european court of human rights . the judges in strasbourg said the german verdict contradicted the right to respect for private and family life , anchored in the european convention on human rights . a hard blow for democracy the german editors protesting the ruling say , however , that as it stands , the decision would only permit reporting on public figures in their public role .
how these people behave , who their business contacts are or who pays for their holidays would go unreported , according to the newsmen . the editors also listed major domestic german news stories that would not have seen the light of day under the new ruling .
they include the perks scandal which led to the resignation of the previous head of germany 's central bank , ernst welteke , and the investment activities of the former head of germany 's powerful metal workers ' union , franz steinkühler . late last week the german association of newspaper publishers publicly voiced their unease .
an industry spokesman said that , if left unchallenged , the ruling would mark a hard blow for democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder the media chiefs have also pointed out that the german government has only four weeks left to contest the european court 's ruling . a government spokesman said chancellor schröder was still considering the legal aspects of the case before deciding on the matter . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paparazzi ruling could restrict german tabloids princess caroline of monaco won her case against german tabloids at the european court of human rights .

referring to double suicide bomb attacks that ripped through two buses in the southern israeli town of beersheba on tuesday killing at least 12 people , fischer said that it was clear that " all efforts had to be taken to bring peace and stability in the region . "
the minister said there had to be an end to terror and violence . " the killing of innocent people on both sides is not acceptable , " he added . a respected mediator earlier fischer , on the last leg of his five-day , five-nation middle east visit , held talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak and prime minister ahmed nasif in alexandria , praising egypt 's peace engagement in gaza .
the two sides also discussed ways of reviving the stalled peace process between the israelis and palestinians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , at a hotel in alexandria , egypt .
in addition , fischer also met with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia in alexandria the german foreign minister , a well-respected mediator in the middle east , repeated what he said in jerusalem a day earlier : that the eu wanted israel 's planned pullout in the gaza strip to be part of a us-backed peace plan and thus take place in coordination with the palestinians .
" gaza can mean a significant progress for the peace process , " fischer said . at the same time the minister said the palestinians also had to cooperate to enable israel to execute its pullout . arab-israeli conflict the main issue the ongoing arab-israeli conflict has been the dominant theme of fischer 's talks in all five mideast countries on his itinerary , beginning with lebanon and on to syria , jordan , israel and finally , egypt . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , in damascus on saturday . during talks with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom in jerusalem on monday , fischer made it clear that a pullout in gaza alone would not suffice , but had to be accompanied by similar steps in the west bank .
" this would lead to a breakthrough , and we in germany and the eu are ready to engage ourselves , " fischer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom , right , with gernman foreign minister joschka fischer during their meeting in jerusalem .
at the same time the minister stressed it was important for israel to halt construction of west bank settlements according to terms of the internationally backed " road map " peace plan . fischer has also underlined that the european union remains committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " he said . sharon brings forward gaza pullout on tuesday sharon announced that evacuation of all 21 jewish settlements from gaza is set for the beginning of next year , advancing the controversial pullout schedule by about eight months . under the gaza plan , four of the 120 settlements in the west bank - home to about 240,000 settlers - would also be moved by next year .
but israeli prime minister ariel sharon intends to hold on to an arc of larger enclaves there . israel seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war .
the international community sees jewish settlements built on those territories as illegal , a view israel disputes . european security linked to mideast 's fischer 's mideast trip has been largely viewed symbolically as peace and stability deteriorate while infighting and chaos paralyzes the palestinian authority and israel continues to build a security wall in violation of international norms . but the german foreign minister was also frank and upfront with his mideast hosts . he condemned syrian interference in lebanon , warned damascus to improve its human rights record and agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction , and urged amman to initiate internal reforms .
even fischer 's message to sharon that gaza can only be the beginning of peace is considered a bold move , given that the pullout remains so controversial in israel . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , in amman , jordan on sunday . in jordan on sunday , fischer gave a hint of the reasons behind his unflagging efforts in the search for a solution to the middle east conflict : " when we talk of our security as europeans , we are talking about the future of our neighbors the middle east , " he said in a press conference .
" if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer : europe 's security linked to mideast 's german foreign minister fischer said sunday in jordan that a solution to the arab-israeli conflict , the stabilization of iraq and regional reforms were necessary to ensure europe 's security .
-lrb- august 29 , 2004 -rrb- fischer delivers strong message in syria german foreign minister fischer focused on economic ties between syria and the eu as well as concerns over human rights and weapons of mass destruction in syria during a visit to damascus saturday .

again the focus was on the east of germany where anger is growing and discontent over conditions in the former communist states is rife . the protests against the german government 's planned welfare cuts entered their fifth week on monday as tens of thousands of germans once again took to the streets of cities across the country to demonstrate . but while chancellor gerhard schröder attempted to appease the nation by reiterating his message that the " hartz iv " reforms would go through for the benefit of germany , a number of politicians and media warned of growing divisions related to the expected effects of the welfare cuts between the former communist eastern germany and the more prosperous west . the proposed cuts to unemployment benefit , a tactic that the chancellor assures will keep the welfare system affordable for an ageing population , are likely to hit the eastern states of germany hardest where unemployment rates are running at nearly 20 percent , twice the level in the more affluent west .
most demonstrations have taken place in eastern cities , with the most vociferous protests once again happening in berlin , leipzig and magdeburg . even former finance minister oskar lafontaine , a long-time political sparring partner of schröder , experienced the growing distaste for anything and anybody attached to the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and was welcomed with whistles and even an egg from a roughly 20,000-strong crowd in leipzig .
despite coming to the platform with an anti-reform message , lafontaine , who is a member of the sdp with strong links to the left , found less support than expected in the crowd .

schröder has struggled to get his message across in the region and has faced angry and potentially volatile protests with eggs and abuse hurled at the chancellor 's direction only last week as he visited leipzig and wittenberg . west is more supportive of reforms figures from the federal statistics office show that the chancellor 's proposed reforms are creating a distinctive east / west division in opinion , with more westerners than easterners supporting " hartz iv , " which will cut benefit for many long-term unemployed and set tougher conditions on claimants , introducing stricter means testing to encourage jobless people to take work of any kind . it appears that in the east , where the former communist regime guaranteed a job for almost everybody , the idea of welfare cuts have released bottled-up frustration that after more than a decade of reunification , many feel worse off than before . just 39 percent of east germans happy with schröder 's brand of democratic leadership , compared with 63 percent in the west .
many in the east have begun to fear they will slide into poverty when the benefit cuts take effect in january and that communist rule now does n't seem so bad . dormant unease has found a release valve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this creeping sense of unease in the eastern states has not really been registered either in the media or by political representatives , " franz walter , a political researcher at göttingen university , told the bremen regional newspaper kurier am sonntag : " so these radical and uncontrolled protests were only a matter of time .

schröder has accused pds officials of hijacking the reform debate . the chancellor 's not for turning but the chancellor , well aware of the damage a pounding in the state elections would do to the sdp 's credibility nationwide , remains unrepentant .
the reforms , he repeats , will not be watered down and discussing the reforms is not a sign that his resolve is weakening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 14 years of german unification opinion : a progress report on german unity dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules solbes blames reunification for german economic woes communism sunk by the hunk in trunks ? germany -pipe- 31.08.2004 a new east-west divide in germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine -lrb- left -rrb- joined the protests on monday more marches against the hartz iv welfare reforms took place on monday .
again the focus was on the east of germany where anger is growing and discontent over conditions in the former communist states is rife . the protests against the german government 's planned welfare cuts entered their fifth week on monday as tens of thousands of germans once again took to the streets of cities across the country to demonstrate . but while chancellor gerhard schröder attempted to appease the nation by reiterating his message that the " hartz iv " reforms would go through for the benefit of germany , a number of politicians and media warned of growing divisions related to the expected effects of the welfare cuts between the former communist eastern germany and the more prosperous west . the proposed cuts to unemployment benefit , a tactic that the chancellor assures will keep the welfare system affordable for an ageing population , are likely to hit the eastern states of germany hardest where unemployment rates are running at nearly 20 percent , twice the level in the more affluent west .
most demonstrations have taken place in eastern cities , with the most vociferous protests once again happening in berlin , leipzig and magdeburg . even former finance minister oskar lafontaine , a long-time political sparring partner of schröder , experienced the growing distaste for anything and anybody attached to the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and was welcomed with whistles and even an egg from a roughly 20,000-strong crowd in leipzig .
despite coming to the platform with an anti-reform message , lafontaine , who is a member of the sdp with strong links to the left , found less support than expected in the crowd .
he called for " an alternative policy of reform " and for a " growth program so that jobs can be created " but the presence of a man rumored to be preparing to form a new political party with other disenchanted spd members divided as much as united the protestors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eggs and abuse came schröder 's way during last week 's visit to the east .
it is a sign of the massive task the spd has to placate the disenchanted people of the east .
schröder has struggled to get his message across in the region and has faced angry and potentially volatile protests with eggs and abuse hurled at the chancellor 's direction only last week as he visited leipzig and wittenberg . west is more supportive of reforms figures from the federal statistics office show that the chancellor 's proposed reforms are creating a distinctive east / west division in opinion , with more westerners than easterners supporting " hartz iv , " which will cut benefit for many long-term unemployed and set tougher conditions on claimants , introducing stricter means testing to encourage jobless people to take work of any kind . it appears that in the east , where the former communist regime guaranteed a job for almost everybody , the idea of welfare cuts have released bottled-up frustration that after more than a decade of reunification , many feel worse off than before . just 39 percent of east germans happy with schröder 's brand of democratic leadership , compared with 63 percent in the west .
many in the east have begun to fear they will slide into poverty when the benefit cuts take effect in january and that communist rule now does n't seem so bad . dormant unease has found a release valve bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " this creeping sense of unease in the eastern states has not really been registered either in the media or by political representatives , " franz walter , a political researcher at göttingen university , told the bremen regional newspaper kurier am sonntag : " so these radical and uncontrolled protests were only a matter of time . " the people of the east will get a different opportunity to voice their protests on sept .
19 when they go to the polls in regional elections in the eastern states of saxony and brandenburg .
the ruling social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- are expected to lose ground heavily to the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the successor to the former east german communist party .
schröder has accused pds officials of hijacking the reform debate . the chancellor 's not for turning but the chancellor , well aware of the damage a pounding in the state elections would do to the sdp 's credibility nationwide , remains unrepentant .
the reforms , he repeats , will not be watered down and discussing the reforms is not a sign that his resolve is weakening . " showing sensitivity and trying to relieve people 's fears ... does not mean changing , it means explaining why what we are doing is necessary , " he said before a party meeting . before the elections take place , more demonstrations are expected .
while the actual numbers of protestors are reported to be less each week , the organizers of the marches have said that the protests for the fifth " monday demonstration " had spread to 202 cities , up from 140 a week ago .
a spokesman for the berlin protesters claimed that more than 200,000 joined the nationwide marches on monday and added that a national demonstration in the capital has been organized for oct .

" milosevic , who is acting as his own lawyer , told the court that he needed more than the 150 days allotted to him to cross-examine more than 1,600 witnesses whom he has said he intends to call to the stand . rejecting the prosecution 's claim that he masterminded the bloody wars that tore apart the yugoslav federation in the early 1990s , he said in his opening defence statement that the international community was " the main force for the destruction " of the country . he also blamed " the nato pact " for the conflict in kosovo , a province of his native serbia , where more than 10,000 people died and about 800,000 ethnic albanians - one-third of the population - were expelled in 1988 and 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of u.n. officals watch a burning serbian house in the serb village of svinjare , south of kosovska mitrovica , saturday march 20 , 2004 .

" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .

" the spd hopes for enough resistance among its own party and in the opposition that the suggestion does n't find the needed majority and can say ' well , we tried . " '
resistance to voter-determined domestic decisions also came from the christian social union , but markus söder , that party 's secretary general , said letting voters decide whether to accept major changes to european law would ensure germans are aware of how they are affected by brussels decisions .

the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .
their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .

they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .

the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .

putin and schröder then held informal bilateral talks during the evening with chirac expected to join the discussions early the next morning after an overnight flight from paris . chirac had been forced to delay his arrival owing to the abduction of two french journalists in iraq by kidnappers who have given paris an ultimatum over its ban on the wearing of the muslim headscarf in state schools .
but the french president did not want to cancel the meeting with his two fellow opponents of the us-led invasion of iraq and arrived early on tuesday in the scenic resort . along with iraq , the three leaders were expected to discuss relations between the european union and russia , as well as regional questions , two days after a controversial presidential election in the war-torn russian republic of chechnya . the leaders began the day with a working breakfast , followed by trilateral talks , with officials emphasizing that the meeting was informal , with no fixed agenda and no necessity to take decisions .
the informality was confirmed by the sighting of the trio chatting in english on the veranda of the residence before heading into their talks after breakfast . chirac reiterates stance on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the mini-summit began after islamic militants holding two french journalists captive gave paris another 24 hours to scrap its controversial ban on the wearing in public schools of islamic headscarves and other signs of religious affiliation .
that ban , made law in france earlier this year , was due to go into effect this week and france has asserted that the law safeguards the country 's stringent secular traditions and will stand . chirac reiterated his call for the release of two journalists . " i am renewing my solemn call for their release , " chirac told reporters at the post-talks press conference .
" everything will be done to secure their release . " putin meanwhile faced his own challenges from extremists in the aftermath of apparent suicide bomber attacks that brought down two commercial airliners in russia last week with the loss of 90 lives . two women from russia 's separatist republic of chechnya , where russian forces are mired in a five-year guerrilla war , were suspected of bringing the planes down and putin has ordered law enforcement agencies to take higher precautions against further " terrorist acts " in russia . putin defends elections in chechnya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya is an on-going dirty war on russia 's doorstep .
chechnya would always remain a part of russia , putin said and defended the elections in the state at the weekend which had been widely criticized . " the chechen people have made their choice , " putin told reporters .
" if the chechen people came out to vote , that means they wanted to decide their republic 's future .
no one dragged them by the scruff of their necks or their hair to the voting stations . " the vote was denounced on monday by the united states as falling short of international standards of freedom and fairness and having " serious flaws " .
the european commission on tuesday also condemned the poll and called for early parliamentary polls in the strife-torn russian republic .
putin confirmed that both chirac and schröder questioned him about the war and said he gave them " detailed " answers . schröder calls for political solution schröder revealed to the press conference that he told putin that " the chechen conflict must be resolved politically , the way that putin has said it would , " and added , " we will continue to look for a solution in critical solidarity . " jacques chirac said he supported his russian counterpart vladimir putin in seeking a political solution in chechnya , provided that it preserves russia 's territorial integrity . " a political solution is necessary and this is what russia wants but a political solution has a limit , " chirac said at the press conference .
pledge of support for iraq but no details on the subject of iraq , all three leaders pledged to work toward bringing stability to the war-torn country , but gave no concrete details about what steps they would take . " we have an interest in contributing everything possible to lead to stabilizing the situation , " putin said but failed to elaborate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. army continues to fight battles across iraq .
putin , schröder and chirac have toned down their criticism of the situation in iraq since their opposition before the us-led invasion , but they made clear their concern about the troubled security situation in iraq . all three nations have refused to send troops to iraq to help in peacekeeping and rebuilding efforts .
france and germany have said they would help train iraqi officers but only outside the country , while russia has offered to help train civilian personnel and said it would consider restructuring iraq 's multibillion dollar debt through the paris club of creditor nations .
russia to continue increase in oil production in a further statement , putin announced that russia would continue to increase the extraction and export of its oil resources . russian firms would " continue to increase the extraction of hydrocarbons and that they will increase their deliveries to the global market , " the russian president told assembled press . russian oil production is expected to reach 450 million tons this year and export some 255 million tons , an increase from 421 million tons of production and 228 million tons of exports last year , he added . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder heads for russian summit the leaders of germany and russia will meet in the black sea resort of sochi on monday to address european relations and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan and iraq .

the informality was confirmed by the sighting of the trio chatting in english on the veranda of the residence before heading into their talks after breakfast . chirac reiterates stance on journalists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french reporter georges malbrunot , right , of le figaro newspaper , and french radio reporter christian chesnot , of radio france internationale -lrb- rfi -rrb- .
the mini-summit began after islamic militants holding two french journalists captive gave paris another 24 hours to scrap its controversial ban on the wearing in public schools of islamic headscarves and other signs of religious affiliation .
that ban , made law in france earlier this year , was due to go into effect this week and france has asserted that the law safeguards the country 's stringent secular traditions and will stand . chirac reiterated his call for the release of two journalists . " i am renewing my solemn call for their release , " chirac told reporters at the post-talks press conference .
" everything will be done to secure their release . " putin meanwhile faced his own challenges from extremists in the aftermath of apparent suicide bomber attacks that brought down two commercial airliners in russia last week with the loss of 90 lives . two women from russia 's separatist republic of chechnya , where russian forces are mired in a five-year guerrilla war , were suspected of bringing the planes down and putin has ordered law enforcement agencies to take higher precautions against further " terrorist acts " in russia . putin defends elections in chechnya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chechnya is an on-going dirty war on russia 's doorstep .
chechnya would always remain a part of russia , putin said and defended the elections in the state at the weekend which had been widely criticized . " the chechen people have made their choice , " putin told reporters .
" if the chechen people came out to vote , that means they wanted to decide their republic 's future .
no one dragged them by the scruff of their necks or their hair to the voting stations . " the vote was denounced on monday by the united states as falling short of international standards of freedom and fairness and having " serious flaws " .
the european commission on tuesday also condemned the poll and called for early parliamentary polls in the strife-torn russian republic .
putin confirmed that both chirac and schröder questioned him about the war and said he gave them " detailed " answers . schröder calls for political solution schröder revealed to the press conference that he told putin that " the chechen conflict must be resolved politically , the way that putin has said it would , " and added , " we will continue to look for a solution in critical solidarity . " jacques chirac said he supported his russian counterpart vladimir putin in seeking a political solution in chechnya , provided that it preserves russia 's territorial integrity .

france and germany have said they would help train iraqi officers but only outside the country , while russia has offered to help train civilian personnel and said it would consider restructuring iraq 's multibillion dollar debt through the paris club of creditor nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 31.08.2004 high bidder faces off against dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe germany 's national coach will be watching the e-bay bidder for € 5,250 a fan going by the name of giusal has bought himself a chance to kick a soccer ball around with the bundesliga 's borussia dortmund . looking for a way to inject some cash into the club 's coffers , hamborn 07 's team coach ingmar putz saved a spot on his wednesday night roster for the friendly match against the bundesliga 's borussia dortmund for the highest bidder of an ebay auction .
at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund is worried an over-aggressive bidder might injure its star tomas rosicky currently ranked eighth in the german premier soccer league , dortmund 's team officials are n't as excited about the auction as their colleagues in hamborn .
they 're afraid someone hardcore enough to spend thousands of euros for a ten-minute appearance might also be willing to injure one of their players .

they 've long proved to be versatile multimedia gadgets and are now even starring in a short film festival in berlin . a ramshackle volkswagen bus flattens a mobile phone with a sickeningly crunching sound under its tires .
in another variation , a mobile phone is pounded to bits with a golf club or a baseball bat .
that 's how a berlin artist duo demonstrates various death scenarios of mobile phones in a 90-second long sequence - shot with a mobile phone outfitted with video technology . the clip is one of around 150 wildly experimental short films competing for the " micromovie award , " the crowning glory of an international film festival focusing exclusively on films shot with mobile phones .
called " interfilm , " the festival will be debuting in berlin from nov .
2 to nov .
7 . in cooperation with its main sponsor , " interfilm " has provided film schools and producers worldwide with the latest mobile phone generation and is now waiting for applications that have to be sent in to berlin by the end of august . short films from around the world bildunterschrift : " solarium " , a short film by konrad sattler there 's little doubt of the popularity of the project .
packets from around 22 countries have already piled up on heide schürmeier 's desk at the " interfilm " office in berlin .
some bear names such as " vancouver film school , " the " univerdsidad del cine " in buenos aires or the " national institute of design " in india . the latter , in particular , has already sent in nine micromovies despite the fact that the indians were equipped with just two mobile phones .
young indian filmmakers have already cemented the bollywood country 's reputation as a quick-film mecca . working with technical limitations but , though shooting with a mobile phone might sound fun , it is n't exactly easy . " there 's no zoom , the light conditions are different , low storage capacity and just when things begin to get exciting the battery 's empty , " schürmeier said .
" but that 's exactly why it 's so thrilling to see how professionals manage with such limitations . " professor tjark ihmels from the institute for media design at the mainz technical college , whose students have also sent in applications to the " interfilm " festival , remembers how challenging the work was . " they -lrb- the students -rrb- were incredulous at how tiny a camera can be , " ihmels said .
he added that most of his students were unused to working without bulky film equipment . " and as far as the quality loss of the handy cameras go , the word ' handicap ' takes on a whole new meaning , " he added . technologically , filming with a video-capable mobile phone is a nightmare .
quick movements are totally unacceptable to the phones , turning picture sequences into choppy , coarse pixels and playing havoc with the colors . " one has to work with distortion , rework it on the computer and incorporate photo elements , " ihmels said .
this kind of technical mop-up before the 90-second end product is allowed by " interfilm . " ihmels is convinced of the benefits of video-capable mobile phones .
he said the greatest art in the making of the mobile phone films was to exploit the technical weaknesses . " then one can aesthetically produce serious beauties , " he said .
" one can be more spontaneous and people also move more freely , more authentically . " on the data protection radar but this freedom of shooting people and things so freely - with the pocket-sized camera allowed almost everywhere and the subtle click on the release button going mostly unobserved - has already attracted the attention of data protection authorities .
" a pirated copy of the facts " is what the " interfilm " crew calls it . but so far voyeuristic short films still have n't reached heide schürmeier . " maybe it contradicts the professional ethos of the filmmakers , " is how she explains it . but ihmels believes there 's another reason behind it . " they 're aware of the legal consequences of secret filming , " he said . currently the " interfilm " team are selecting the 20 best applications , which can be viewed on the internet at the beginning of october .
in november , spectators can then vote which mobile phone film wins the € 3,000 endowed " micromovie award . " however , they 'll have to crowd around a small computer monitor to do that because despite all the technological sophistication , the graphic resolution of the " micromovies " does n't suffice for a large silver screen . ina rottscheidt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nokia 's jetset mobile : it blings and rings five years ago mobile phones were the latest rage .
today they are a commodity .
but there still are ways to stand out from the crowd : either by refusing to own a phone altogether , or by spending € 3500 euro for a vertu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's economic woes gloom deepens over german economy both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off negotiations at opel continue opinion : blame the managers , not the country business -pipe- 31.08.2004 germany to breach eu deficit rules in 2004 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichel said germany would stay in the red this year german finance minister hans eichel on tuesday said berlin would breach eu deficit limits for a third consecutive year in 2004 .
the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .

the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .

the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .
the move angered berlin , which contends disciplinary proceedings are only warranted against countries that are being uncooperative on the budgetary issues . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

31 , 1994 , the last russian soldiers and officers of the " western group of forces " -lrb- wgf -rrb- left germany .

" milosevic , who is acting as his own lawyer , told the court that he needed more than the 150 days allotted to him to cross-examine more than 1,600 witnesses whom he has said he intends to call to the stand . rejecting the prosecution 's claim that he masterminded the bloody wars that tore apart the yugoslav federation in the early 1990s , he said in his opening defence statement that the international community was " the main force for the destruction " of the country . he also blamed " the nato pact " for the conflict in kosovo , a province of his native serbia , where more than 10,000 people died and about 800,000 ethnic albanians - one-third of the population - were expelled in 1988 and 1999 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a group of u.n. officals watch a burning serbian house in the serb village of svinjare , south of kosovska mitrovica , saturday march 20 , 2004 .
all of the 130 houses as well as the orthodox cemetery in the village have been looted and burnt by ethnic albanians who attacked the village .
milosevic faces a total of 60 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the 1991-95 war in croatia , the 1992-95 war in bosnia and the kosovo campaign .
he has also been charged with genocide and complicity in genocide , the gravest of war crimes , for the war in bosnia , which left 200,000 people dead .
he faces a life sentence if convicted . dressed in his customary dark blue suit and a red , blue and white striped tie - the colors of the yugoslav flag - the 63-year-old former president told the three-judge tribunal : " in the international public for a long time an untruthful and distorted picture was created about what happened in yugoslavia .
the accusations against me are unscrupulous lies . " milosevic was given four hours to present the outlines of his defense case but he said he would need two days . " i would like to note that the other side -lrb- the prosecution -rrb- got three days to present their opening statement , " he told the court . health concerns after milosevic completes his opening statement , the judges are expected to hold a procedural hearing to discuss his health problems , which have caused his trial to be adjourned 14 times since it began in february 2002 . the prosecution has urged the court to appoint a defense lawyer to act for milosevic , who they accuse of " hijacking the trial to his agenda while stopping just short of obstructionism . "
but " friends of the court " - lawyers appointed to ensure milosevic gets a fair trial - have warned that it would only add more stress if he were forced to take on a defense lawyer against his will . milosevic said during a procedural hearing that he planned to call british prime minister tony blair , german chancellor gerhard schröder and former us president bill clinton as witnesses .
his advisors have confirmed only that former greek prime minister constantine mitsotakis and his former russian counterpart , yevgeny primakov , would be called to testify .
the first defence witness will be called on sept .
7 but the court has not revealed who it will be . referring to the kosovo conflict , where the prosecution alleges that milosevic was individually responsible for " the campaign of terror and violence directed at kosovo albanian civilians " , he said the real aggressors were " the nato pact . " he also blamed the conflict on " external forces " which worked with " ustasha extremists -lrb- croat nationalists -rrb- , islamic fundamentalists and albanian terrorists whose role was to be the detonator of the conflict .

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund is worried an over-aggressive bidder might injure its star tomas rosicky currently ranked eighth in the german premier soccer league , dortmund 's team officials are n't as excited about the auction as their colleagues in hamborn .
they 're afraid someone hardcore enough to spend thousands of euros for a ten-minute appearance might also be willing to injure one of their players .
the hamborn coach said the inclusion of a novice player would be a one-off , and the money would go to a good purpose : the purchase of an artificial turf for the junior league . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " and finally ...

the announcement comes amid speculation brussels will loosen its budget rules . eichel told reporters that the german government estimated that its public deficit will amount to 3.7 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , way above the eu limit of 3.0 percent . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone countries like germany are not supposed to run up deficits above the limit .
but the german deficit already breached that level in 2002 and 2003 and will do so again this year as europe 's largest economy continues to suffer from meager growth . " the three years of continuing stagnation and weak growth in europe will also affect public budgets , " eichel said at a press conference in berlin .
he said breaking the budget rules " made sense economically and was acceptable " since the country 's growth prospects should not be strangled by pursuing tight fiscal policies . until now , the german finance ministry has been pencilling in a deficit ratio of 3.3 percent for the current year .
germany is also set to breach another key maastricht criterion .
the overall debt ratio - which is not allowed to exceed 60 percent of gdp - would amount to an estimated 66 percent of gdp in 2004 . lower tax revenues not only does berlin face lower tax revenues , but a sharp increase in labor market expenditures .
in addition , germany 's public finances had been hit by one-off factors such as an unexpected drop in the bundesbank 's annual profits and the absence of any revenues from the planned tax on heavy trucks using the country 's overcrowded motorways . nevertheless , eichel has pledged to bring the deficit back within the 3.0-percent limit next year , even if many experts believe that goal is unrealistic . " the federal government will do everything it can on the basis of a solid recovery to stick once again to the three-percent deficit limit in 2005 , " he said . according to figures published last week by the federal statistics office , destatis , the german public deficit - which comprises the federal government , regional state and municipal as well as the social security budgets - totalled € 42.7 billion -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in the period from january to june .
that was equivalent to a record 4.0 percent of gdp . the finance ministry based its optimism in curtailing the deficit on the improved outlook for growth and the government 's structural and economic reforms . stability pact revamp but eichel may not have to worry too much about tackling the deficit next year if the eu revamps the stability pact .
the european commission on friday will present its plans to overhaul the eu 's deficit rules on friday .
according to several reports , brussels is likely to loosen the pact so it gives states more leeway in times of economic downturn . european monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia 's plans to increase the flexibility of the eu 's budgetary rules will be warmly welcomed in germany and france , both of which have had difficulty keeping deficits under control in recent years .
finance ministers from berlin and paris led efforts in november to suspend the sanctions process against countries breaking the eu deficit rules . that caused the commission to pursue legal action at the european court of justice to enforce the growth and stability pact , which was designed to underpin the euro .
the move angered berlin , which contends disciplinary proceedings are only warranted against countries that are being uncooperative on the budgetary issues . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de court annulls eu stability pact suspension the european court of justice ruled against a decision by the eu council of finance ministers that had suspended excessive deficit measures launched against france and germany .

at € 5,250 -lrb- $ 6,327 -rrb- , an anymous bidder logging in under the name of giusal won 10 minutes on the pitch against the pros .
" there is always someone crazy enough to spend money on this kind of thing , " club chairman hans herr told die welt newspaper prior to the conclusion of the auction tuesday night .
bidding for the three-day auction began at € 1 saturday and shot up to over € 1,000 by tuesday morning .
with just a few hours left on the clock , the bids jumped up to well over € 4,000 .
" we never expected such a high amount , " hamborn 's coach putz said after the winning bid was announced .
while 10 minutes of playing time probably wo n't be enough for the high bidder to score a goal against the likes of german national team midfielder sebastian kehl , there will be plenty of time to get some autographs in the locker room .
the auction has been a boon for the hamborn club .
the stands at the team 's holtkamp stadium , near the city of duisburg , are already sold out , and several television stations have said they would broadcast the game - a first for the hamborn club .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2004 germans mull vote on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public is n't likely to be voting on the eu constitution the ruling social democratic party 's plan to alter the constitution and introduce plebiscites to the german political scene was quickly rejected by opposition parties , but debate may not be over yet . after months of discussion , the issue of who should vote on what and how has come to the forefront as german leaders ponder whether to approve the new constitution for the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in a surprising change of opinion , chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- , who last month said a parliamentary vote would ratify the eu constitution in germany , this weekend suggested changing germany 's constitution to allow voters to decide on major issues - with the condition the changes apply to domestic as well as european topics .
" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .
the greens , the ruling coalition 's junior partner , were pleased with the chancellor 's new line , as were the neo-liberal free democrats .
green party head angelika beer said she hopes " the spd 's clear signal " will prompt the opposition to express support for plebiscites .
opposition against domestic plebiscites but while the government would find backing for european votes , it is domestic decisions that conservative opposition parties are against .
without their help the spd does n't have a chance of reaching the two-thirds majority needed for the changes to pass in the bundestag and bundesrat , germany 's two houses of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's laurenz meyer said his party could still change its mind laurenz meyer , the christian democratic union 's secretary general , expressed his party 's " serious concerns " about domestic plebiscites , which are currently only called when the country restructures federal territory .
but he said the last word has n't be spoken until after his party meets wednesday .
political wrangling other cdu members , however , were less reserved , calling the chancellor 's change of direction nothing but politics as usual .
" it 's a tactical trick , " matthias wissmann , chair of the cdu 's european committee , told the berliner zeitung .
" the spd hopes for enough resistance among its own party and in the opposition that the suggestion does n't find the needed majority and can say ' well , we tried . " '
resistance to voter-determined domestic decisions also came from the christian social union , but markus söder , that party 's secretary general , said letting voters decide whether to accept major changes to european law would ensure germans are aware of how they are affected by brussels decisions .
timely decision but some spd members said it was more important to ratify the eu constitution quickly than to spend time trying to introduce referendums in germany .
angelica schwall-düren , the spd 's deputy chair , said she did n't think the time was right for german constitutional changes , referring to a failed attempt to introduce referendums two years ago .
so far a total of 10 nations , including france and britain , have decided to hold referendums on the european constitution .
the constitution will only be enacted if it is ratified by all 25 of the bloc 's member states . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics .
-lrb- aug .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in a surprising change of opinion , chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- , who last month said a parliamentary vote would ratify the eu constitution in germany , this weekend suggested changing germany 's constitution to allow voters to decide on major issues - with the condition the changes apply to domestic as well as european topics .
" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .
the greens , the ruling coalition 's junior partner , were pleased with the chancellor 's new line , as were the neo-liberal free democrats .
green party head angelika beer said she hopes " the spd 's clear signal " will prompt the opposition to express support for plebiscites .
opposition against domestic plebiscites but while the government would find backing for european votes , it is domestic decisions that conservative opposition parties are against .

political wrangling other cdu members , however , were less reserved , calling the chancellor 's change of direction nothing but politics as usual .
" it 's a tactical trick , " matthias wissmann , chair of the cdu 's european committee , told the berliner zeitung .
" the spd hopes for enough resistance among its own party and in the opposition that the suggestion does n't find the needed majority and can say ' well , we tried . " '
resistance to voter-determined domestic decisions also came from the christian social union , but markus söder , that party 's secretary general , said letting voters decide whether to accept major changes to european law would ensure germans are aware of how they are affected by brussels decisions .
timely decision but some spd members said it was more important to ratify the eu constitution quickly than to spend time trying to introduce referendums in germany .

the calls for the release of christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper have stressed that from the very beginning , france was opposed to the war in iraq .
therefore any french reporters on the ground would be operating in a neutral capacity . but this latest case of westerners being held captive under a death threat in iraq has little to do with the contentious conflict in that land . it is claimed that their detention and possible execution in fact has its roots in a situation within france , their own country .
the kidnappers from the so-called " islamic army of iraq " are not concerned with france 's political involvement in the iraq war but with the headscarf ban in french schools which comes into effect at the beginning of september . the kidnapping case has revealed a level of public protest more notable and with more supporters than the amount of islamic federations who stand against the headscarf ban .
the protest is against the kidnapping itself and it is coming from a large contingent of french muslims . an insult to all muslims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators , including journalists and members of the muslim community , gathered on the trocadero esplanade in paris on monday to protest against the kidnapping those who have joined to protest are angry about the use of the word " islamic " in the title of the group responsible and in the justification of its actions .
they see this as an insult to muslims all around the world , and reject the claim made by the group that the actions are dictated by the koran , islam 's holy teachings . the french muslims say that the use of terror tactics , the taking of hostages and so-called " executions " of the innocent have nothing to do with the teachings of the koran and represent the actions and beliefs of individual radical groups .
they believe that there is no religious basis for the kidnapper 's actions , which are simply abominable . prejudices about a " basic radicalism " in islam continue to spread in the west - an untruth not only based on a lack of knowledge or superficial reports in the media .
prejudices also spread because few islamic voices speak out against actions such as the kidnappings , leaving the extremists to comment in the name of islam - extremists who consciously want to stoke the fires of the conflict of cultures . murder is a bigger threat to islam than ban but the example of france shows that things can go differently as well .
not only organizations who promote integration but also regular muslims and even extremely conservative islamic groups are opposing the attempt to prevent the headscarf ban by threatening to kill people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic organizations are committed to reversing the headscarf ban but will not advocate the taking of hostages to achieve it .
their belief that the ban must be reversed in a lawful way points to the fact that even conservative islamic federations in europe are becoming more and more integrated into the democratic system and that actions such as the kidnappings only damage their own position . one can only hope that the actions of french muslims will have a life-saving effect in the case of the two journalists . rainer sollich -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de france calls for release of journalists held in iraq the french government , in crisis mode , on sunday called for the release of two french journalists kidnapped in iraq by islamic militants demanding that paris rescind a ban on headscarves in state schools .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2004 germans mull vote on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public is n't likely to be voting on the eu constitution the ruling social democratic party 's plan to alter the constitution and introduce plebiscites to the german political scene was quickly rejected by opposition parties , but debate may not be over yet . after months of discussion , the issue of who should vote on what and how has come to the forefront as german leaders ponder whether to approve the new constitution for the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in a surprising change of opinion , chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- , who last month said a parliamentary vote would ratify the eu constitution in germany , this weekend suggested changing germany 's constitution to allow voters to decide on major issues - with the condition the changes apply to domestic as well as european topics .
" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .
the greens , the ruling coalition 's junior partner , were pleased with the chancellor 's new line , as were the neo-liberal free democrats .
green party head angelika beer said she hopes " the spd 's clear signal " will prompt the opposition to express support for plebiscites .
opposition against domestic plebiscites but while the government would find backing for european votes , it is domestic decisions that conservative opposition parties are against .
without their help the spd does n't have a chance of reaching the two-thirds majority needed for the changes to pass in the bundestag and bundesrat , germany 's two houses of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's laurenz meyer said his party could still change its mind laurenz meyer , the christian democratic union 's secretary general , expressed his party 's " serious concerns " about domestic plebiscites , which are currently only called when the country restructures federal territory .
but he said the last word has n't be spoken until after his party meets wednesday .
political wrangling other cdu members , however , were less reserved , calling the chancellor 's change of direction nothing but politics as usual .
" it 's a tactical trick , " matthias wissmann , chair of the cdu 's european committee , told the berliner zeitung .
" the spd hopes for enough resistance among its own party and in the opposition that the suggestion does n't find the needed majority and can say ' well , we tried . " '
resistance to voter-determined domestic decisions also came from the christian social union , but markus söder , that party 's secretary general , said letting voters decide whether to accept major changes to european law would ensure germans are aware of how they are affected by brussels decisions .
timely decision but some spd members said it was more important to ratify the eu constitution quickly than to spend time trying to introduce referendums in germany .
angelica schwall-düren , the spd 's deputy chair , said she did n't think the time was right for german constitutional changes , referring to a failed attempt to introduce referendums two years ago .
so far a total of 10 nations , including france and britain , have decided to hold referendums on the european constitution .
the constitution will only be enacted if it is ratified by all 25 of the bloc 's member states . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics .

referring to double suicide bomb attacks that ripped through two buses in the southern israeli town of beersheba on tuesday killing at least 12 people , fischer said that it was clear that " all efforts had to be taken to bring peace and stability in the region . "
the minister said there had to be an end to terror and violence . " the killing of innocent people on both sides is not acceptable , " he added . a respected mediator earlier fischer , on the last leg of his five-day , five-nation middle east visit , held talks with egyptian president hosni mubarak and prime minister ahmed nasif in alexandria , praising egypt 's peace engagement in gaza .
the two sides also discussed ways of reviving the stalled peace process between the israelis and palestinians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer meets with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia , left , at a hotel in alexandria , egypt .
in addition , fischer also met with palestinian prime minister ahmed qureia in alexandria the german foreign minister , a well-respected mediator in the middle east , repeated what he said in jerusalem a day earlier : that the eu wanted israel 's planned pullout in the gaza strip to be part of a us-backed peace plan and thus take place in coordination with the palestinians .
" gaza can mean a significant progress for the peace process , " fischer said . at the same time the minister said the palestinians also had to cooperate to enable israel to execute its pullout . arab-israeli conflict the main issue the ongoing arab-israeli conflict has been the dominant theme of fischer 's talks in all five mideast countries on his itinerary , beginning with lebanon and on to syria , jordan , israel and finally , egypt . bildunterschrift : syrian president bashar assad meets german foreign minister joschka fischer , right , in damascus on saturday . during talks with israeli foreign minister silvan shalom in jerusalem on monday , fischer made it clear that a pullout in gaza alone would not suffice , but had to be accompanied by similar steps in the west bank .
" this would lead to a breakthrough , and we in germany and the eu are ready to engage ourselves , " fischer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister silvan shalom , right , with gernman foreign minister joschka fischer during their meeting in jerusalem .
at the same time the minister stressed it was important for israel to halt construction of west bank settlements according to terms of the internationally backed " road map " peace plan . fischer has also underlined that the european union remains committed to the road map - derailed for more than a year by violence on both sides - as the only way to end the arab-israeli conflict .
" we have a unified european position and we must move forward on this position because we think the region needs a fair compromise based on a two-state solution between israel and the palestinians , " he said . sharon brings forward gaza pullout on tuesday sharon announced that evacuation of all 21 jewish settlements from gaza is set for the beginning of next year , advancing the controversial pullout schedule by about eight months . under the gaza plan , four of the 120 settlements in the west bank - home to about 240,000 settlers - would also be moved by next year .
but israeli prime minister ariel sharon intends to hold on to an arc of larger enclaves there . israel seized the west bank and gaza in the 1967 middle east war .
the international community sees jewish settlements built on those territories as illegal , a view israel disputes . european security linked to mideast 's fischer 's mideast trip has been largely viewed symbolically as peace and stability deteriorate while infighting and chaos paralyzes the palestinian authority and israel continues to build a security wall in violation of international norms . but the german foreign minister was also frank and upfront with his mideast hosts . he condemned syrian interference in lebanon , warned damascus to improve its human rights record and agree to renouncing weapons of mass destruction , and urged amman to initiate internal reforms .
even fischer 's message to sharon that gaza can only be the beginning of peace is considered a bold move , given that the pullout remains so controversial in israel . bildunterschrift : king abdullah ii of jordan , right , meets with german foreign minister joschka fischer , left , in amman , jordan on sunday . in jordan on sunday , fischer gave a hint of the reasons behind his unflagging efforts in the search for a solution to the middle east conflict : " when we talk of our security as europeans , we are talking about the future of our neighbors the middle east , " he said in a press conference .
" if things are going badly wrong in the region , it will hurt our interests immediately and our security so it 's not that we only have political and moral interests in peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.08.2004 germans mull vote on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german public is n't likely to be voting on the eu constitution the ruling social democratic party 's plan to alter the constitution and introduce plebiscites to the german political scene was quickly rejected by opposition parties , but debate may not be over yet . after months of discussion , the issue of who should vote on what and how has come to the forefront as german leaders ponder whether to approve the new constitution for the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in a surprising change of opinion , chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- spd -rrb- , who last month said a parliamentary vote would ratify the eu constitution in germany , this weekend suggested changing germany 's constitution to allow voters to decide on major issues - with the condition the changes apply to domestic as well as european topics .
" it 's a huge chance to inspire a new understanding of the eu in the population , " sigmar gabriel , lower saxony 's spd 's parliamentary group leader , told der tagesspiegel .
the greens , the ruling coalition 's junior partner , were pleased with the chancellor 's new line , as were the neo-liberal free democrats .
green party head angelika beer said she hopes " the spd 's clear signal " will prompt the opposition to express support for plebiscites .
opposition against domestic plebiscites but while the government would find backing for european votes , it is domestic decisions that conservative opposition parties are against .
without their help the spd does n't have a chance of reaching the two-thirds majority needed for the changes to pass in the bundestag and bundesrat , germany 's two houses of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's laurenz meyer said his party could still change its mind laurenz meyer , the christian democratic union 's secretary general , expressed his party 's " serious concerns " about domestic plebiscites , which are currently only called when the country restructures federal territory .
but he said the last word has n't be spoken until after his party meets wednesday .
political wrangling other cdu members , however , were less reserved , calling the chancellor 's change of direction nothing but politics as usual .
" it 's a tactical trick , " matthias wissmann , chair of the cdu 's european committee , told the berliner zeitung .
" the spd hopes for enough resistance among its own party and in the opposition that the suggestion does n't find the needed majority and can say ' well , we tried . " '
resistance to voter-determined domestic decisions also came from the christian social union , but markus söder , that party 's secretary general , said letting voters decide whether to accept major changes to european law would ensure germans are aware of how they are affected by brussels decisions .
timely decision but some spd members said it was more important to ratify the eu constitution quickly than to spend time trying to introduce referendums in germany .
angelica schwall-düren , the spd 's deputy chair , said she did n't think the time was right for german constitutional changes , referring to a failed attempt to introduce referendums two years ago .
so far a total of 10 nations , including france and britain , have decided to hold referendums on the european constitution .
the constitution will only be enacted if it is ratified by all 25 of the bloc 's member states . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution stirs up german debate on plebiscites the debate over whether or not to hold a referendum on the eu constitution has simmered for months , at the same time fueling discussions over whether plebiscites should play a greater roll in german politics .

japanese industrial production has failed to expand for a second month in succession , official data has shown .
the nation 's industrial output in july remained unchanged from june , according to the below-expectation figures .
july 's 0 % month-on-month figure follows june 's 1.3 % fall - another sign that japan 's economy could be slowing down .
analysts had expected a 1 % increase for july , and the release of the data helped see the nikkei drop 1.18 % by afternoon trading in tokyo on tuesday .
the japanese government has also recently reported that householder spending fell in july for a third straight month , while last month 's jobless rate jumped to 4.9 % from 4.6 % in june .
' upward direction ' a spokesman for the ministry of economy , trade and industry -lrb- meti -rrb- said it was sticking to its assessment that industrial production remains " in a gradual rising trend " , forecasting that output would increase over the next two months .
" even in the upward trend it is not always possible to attain the increase of output every month , " he said .
" in addition , our forecast on output activity over the next two months , based on our survey results , is not bad . "
the meti forecasts that industrial output will rise by 1.5 % month-on-month in august , and by 0.6 % in september .
by product sector , output of steel rose 1.6 % in july due to strong demand across asia ; while output of plastic products increased 2.1 % , thanks to demand from the auto industry and beverage makers .
but output of electronic devices fell 3.8 % month-on-month .

watch the speech this week , millions of americans , not all republicans , weigh our claim on their support for the two men who have led our country in these challenging times with moral courage and firm resolve .
so i begin with the words of a great american from the other party , given at his party 's convention in the year i was born .
my purpose is not imitation , for i ca n't match his eloquence , but respect for the relevance in our time of his rousing summons to greatness of an earlier generation of americans .
' rendezvous with destiny ' in a time of deep distress at home , as tyranny strangled the aspirations to liberty of millions , and as war clouds gathered in the west and east , franklin delano roosevelt accepted his party 's nomination by observing : " there is a mysterious cycle in human events .
to some generations much is given .
of other generations much is expected .
this generation of americans has a rendezvous with destiny . "
the awful events of 11 september 2001 declared a war we were vaguely aware of , but had n't really comprehended how near the threat was , and how terrible were the plans of our enemies .
it 's a big thing , this war .
it 's a fight between a just regard for human dignity and a malevolent force that defiles an honourable religion by disputing god 's love for every soul on earth .
it 's a fight between right and wrong , good and evil .
and should our enemies acquire for their arsenal the chemical , biological and nuclear weapons they seek , this war will become a much bigger thing .
so it is , whether we wished it or not , that we have come to the test of our generation , to our rendezvous with destiny .
and much is expected of us .
we are engaged in a hard struggle against a cruel and determined adversary .
our enemies have made clear the danger they pose to our security and to the very essence of our culture ... liberty .
only the most deluded of us could doubt the necessity of this war .
like all wars , this one will have its ups and downs .
but we must fight .
we must .
the sacrifices borne in our defence are not shared equally by all americans .
but all americans must share a resolve to see this war through to a just end .
we must not be complacent at moments of success , and we must not despair over setbacks .
we must learn from our mistakes , improve on our successes , and vanquish this unpardonable enemy .
savage atrocity if we do less , we will fail the one mission no american generation has ever failed - to provide to our children a stronger , better country than the one we were blessed to inherit .
remember how we felt when the serenity of a bright september morning was destroyed by a savage atrocity so hostile to all human virtue we could scarcely imagine any human being capable of it .
we were united .
first , in sorrow and anger .
then in recognition we were attacked not for a wrong we had done , but for who we are a people united in a kinship of ideals , committed to the notion that the people are sovereign , not governments , not armies , not a pitiless , inhumane theocracy , not kings , mullahs or tyrants , but the people .
in that moment , we were not different races .
we were not poor or rich .
we were not democrat or republican , liberal or conservative .
we were not two countries .
we were americans .
all of us , despite the differences that enliven our politics , are united in the one big idea that freedom is our birthright and its defence is always our first responsibility .
all other responsibilities come second .
we must not lose sight of that as we debate who among us should bear the greatest responsibility for keeping us safe and free .
we must , whatever our disagreements , stick together in this great challenge of our time .
my friends in the democratic party - and i 'm fortunate to call many of them my friends - assure us they share the conviction that winning the war against terrorism is our government 's most important obligation .
i do n't doubt their sincerity .
they emphasise that military action alone wo n't protect us , that this war has many fronts : in courts , financial institutions , in the shadowy world of intelligence , and in diplomacy .
expect solidarity they stress that america needs the help of her friends to combat an evil that threatens us all , that our alliances are as important to victory as are our armies .
we agree .
and , as we 've been a good friend to other countries in moments of shared perils , so we have good reason to expect their solidarity with us in this struggle .
that is what the president believes .
and , thanks to his efforts we have received valuable assistance from many good friends around the globe , even if we have , at times , been disappointed with the reactions of some .
i do n't doubt the sincerity of my democratic friends .
and they should not doubt ours .
our president will work with all nations willing to help us defeat this scourge that afflicts us all .
war is an awful business .
the lives of a nation 's finest patriots are sacrificed .
innocent people suffer .
commerce is disrupted , economies are damaged .
strategic interests shielded by years of statecraft are endangered as the demands of war and diplomacy conflict .
however just the cause , we should shed a tear for all that is lost when war claims its wages from us .
but there is no avoiding this war .
we tried that , and our reluctance cost us dearly .
and while this war has many components , we ca n't make victory on the battlefield harder to achieve so that our diplomacy is easier to conduct .
that is not just an expression of our strength .
it 's a measure of our wisdom .
that 's why i commend to my country the re-election of president bush , and the steady , experienced , public-spirited man who serves as our vice-president , dick cheney .
four years ago , in philadelphia , i spoke of my confidence that president bush would accept the responsibilities that come with america 's distinction as the world 's only superpower .
i promised he would not let america " retreat behind empty threats , false promises and uncertain diplomacy " , that he would " confidently defend our interests and values wherever they are threatened " .
i knew my confidence was well placed when i watched him stand on the rubble of the world trade center , with his arm around a hero of 11 september , and in our moment of mourning and anger , strengthen our unity and summon our resolve by promising to right this terrible wrong , and to stand up and fight for the values we hold dear .
he promised our enemies would soon hear from us .
and so they did .
so they did .
he ordered american forces to afghanistan and took the fight to our enemies , and away from our shores , seriously injuring al-qaeda and destroying the regime that gave them safe haven .
he worked effectively to secure the co-operation of pakistan , a relationship that 's critical to our success against al-qaeda .
he encouraged other friends to recognise the peril that terrorism posed for them , and won their help in apprehending many of those who would attack us again , and in helping to freeze the assets they used to fund their bloody work .
iraq threat after years of failed diplomacy and limited military pressure to restrain saddam hussein , president bush made the difficult decision to liberate iraq .
those who criticise that decision would have us believe that the choice was between a status quo that was well enough left alone and war .
but there was no status quo to be left alone .
the years of keeping saddam in a box were coming to a close .
the international consensus that he be kept isolated and unarmed had eroded to the point that many critics of military action had decided the time had come again to do business with saddam , despite his near daily attacks on our pilots , and his refusal , until his last day in power , to allow the unrestricted inspection of his arsenal .
our choice was n't between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war .
it was between war and a graver threat .
do n't let anyone tell you otherwise .
not our critics abroad .
not our political opponents .
and certainly not a disingenuous film maker who would have us believe that saddam 's iraq was an oasis of peace when in fact it was a place of indescribable cruelty , torture chambers , mass graves and prisons that destroyed the lives of the small children held inside their walls .
whether or not saddam possessed the terrible weapons he once had and used , freed from international pressure and the threat of military action , he would have acquired them again .
the central security concern of our time is to keep such devastating weapons beyond the reach of terrorists who ca n't be dissuaded from using them by the threat of mutual destruction .
we could n't afford the risk posed by an unconstrained saddam in these dangerous times .
by destroying his regime we gave hope to people long oppressed that if they have the courage to fight for it , they may live in peace and freedom .
most importantly , our efforts may encourage the people of a region that has never known peace or freedom or lasting stability that they may someday possess these rights .
i believe as strongly today as ever , the mission was necessary , achievable and noble .
for his determination to undertake it , and for his unflagging resolve to see it through to a just end , president bush deserves not only our support , but our admiration .
as the president rightly reminds us , we are safer than we were on 11 september , but we 're not yet safe .
we are still closer to the beginning than the end of this fight .
we need a leader with the experience to make the tough decisions and the resolve to stick with them ; a leader who will keep us moving forward even if it is easier to rest .
and this president will not rest until america is stronger and safer still , and this hateful iniquity is vanquished .
he has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time , and i salute him .
i salute his determination to make this world a better , safer , freer place .
he has not wavered .
he has not flinched from the hard choices .
he will not yield .
and neither will we .
i said earlier that the sacrifices in this war will not be shared equally by all americans .
the president is the first to observe , most of the sacrifices fall , as they have before , to the brave men and women of our armed forces .
we may be good citizens , but make no mistake , they are the very best of us .
it 's an honour to live in a country that is so well and so bravely defended by such patriots .
may god bless them , the living and the fallen , as he has blessed us with their service .
love greater than hate for their families , for their friends , for america , for mankind they sacrifice to affirm that right makes might ; that good triumphs over evil ; that freedom is stronger than tyranny ; that love is greater than hate .
it is left to us to keep their generous benefaction alive , and our blessed , beautiful country worthy of their courage .
we should be thankful - for the privilege .
our country 's security does n't depend on the heroism of every citizen .
but we have to be worthy of the sacrifices made on our behalf .
we have to love our freedom , not just for the material benefits it provides , not just for the autonomy it guarantees us , but for the goodness it makes possible .
we have to love it as much , if not as heroically , as the brave americans who defend us at the risk , and often the cost of their lives .
no american alive today will ever forget what happened on the morning of 11 september .
that day was the moment when the pendulum of history swung toward a new era .
the opening chapter was tinged with great sadness and uncertainty .
it shook us from our complacency in the belief that the cold war 's end had ushered in a time of global tranquillity .
but an absence of complacency should not provoke an absence of confidence .
what our enemies have sought to destroy is beyond their reach .
it can not be taken from us .
it can only be surrendered .
argument among friends my friends , we are again met on the field of political competition with our fellow countrymen .
it is more than appropriate , it is necessary that even in times of crisis we have these contests , and engage in spirited disagreement over the shape and course of our government .
we have nothing to fear from each other .
we are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom , and promote the general welfare .
but it should remain an argument among friends who share an unshaken belief in our great cause , and in the goodness of each other .
we are americans first , americans last , americans always .
let us argue our differences .
but remember we are not enemies , but comrades in a war against a real enemy , and take courage from the knowledge that our military superiority is matched only by the superiority of our ideals , and our unconquerable love for them .
our adversaries are weaker than us in arms and men , but weaker still in causes .
they fight to express a hatred for all that is good in humanity .
we fight for love of freedom and justice , a love that is invincible .
keep that faith .
keep your courage .
stick together .
stay strong .
do not yield .
do not flinch .
stand up .
stand up with our president and fight .
we 're americans .
we 're americans , and we 'll never surrender .
they will .

i knew my confidence was well placed when i watched him stand on the rubble of the world trade center , with his arm around a hero of 11 september , and in our moment of mourning and anger , strengthen our unity and summon our resolve by promising to right this terrible wrong , and to stand up and fight for the values we hold dear .
he promised our enemies would soon hear from us .
and so they did .
so they did .
he ordered american forces to afghanistan and took the fight to our enemies , and away from our shores , seriously injuring al-qaeda and destroying the regime that gave them safe haven .
he worked effectively to secure the co-operation of pakistan , a relationship that 's critical to our success against al-qaeda .
he encouraged other friends to recognise the peril that terrorism posed for them , and won their help in apprehending many of those who would attack us again , and in helping to freeze the assets they used to fund their bloody work .
iraq threat after years of failed diplomacy and limited military pressure to restrain saddam hussein , president bush made the difficult decision to liberate iraq .
those who criticise that decision would have us believe that the choice was between a status quo that was well enough left alone and war .
but there was no status quo to be left alone .
the years of keeping saddam in a box were coming to a close .
the international consensus that he be kept isolated and unarmed had eroded to the point that many critics of military action had decided the time had come again to do business with saddam , despite his near daily attacks on our pilots , and his refusal , until his last day in power , to allow the unrestricted inspection of his arsenal .
our choice was n't between a benign status quo and the bloodshed of war .
it was between war and a graver threat .
do n't let anyone tell you otherwise .
not our critics abroad .
not our political opponents .
and certainly not a disingenuous film maker who would have us believe that saddam 's iraq was an oasis of peace when in fact it was a place of indescribable cruelty , torture chambers , mass graves and prisons that destroyed the lives of the small children held inside their walls .
whether or not saddam possessed the terrible weapons he once had and used , freed from international pressure and the threat of military action , he would have acquired them again .
the central security concern of our time is to keep such devastating weapons beyond the reach of terrorists who ca n't be dissuaded from using them by the threat of mutual destruction .
we could n't afford the risk posed by an unconstrained saddam in these dangerous times .
by destroying his regime we gave hope to people long oppressed that if they have the courage to fight for it , they may live in peace and freedom .
most importantly , our efforts may encourage the people of a region that has never known peace or freedom or lasting stability that they may someday possess these rights .
i believe as strongly today as ever , the mission was necessary , achievable and noble .
for his determination to undertake it , and for his unflagging resolve to see it through to a just end , president bush deserves not only our support , but our admiration .
as the president rightly reminds us , we are safer than we were on 11 september , but we 're not yet safe .
we are still closer to the beginning than the end of this fight .
we need a leader with the experience to make the tough decisions and the resolve to stick with them ; a leader who will keep us moving forward even if it is easier to rest .
and this president will not rest until america is stronger and safer still , and this hateful iniquity is vanquished .
he has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time , and i salute him .
i salute his determination to make this world a better , safer , freer place .
he has not wavered .
he has not flinched from the hard choices .
he will not yield .
and neither will we .
i said earlier that the sacrifices in this war will not be shared equally by all americans .
the president is the first to observe , most of the sacrifices fall , as they have before , to the brave men and women of our armed forces .
we may be good citizens , but make no mistake , they are the very best of us .
it 's an honour to live in a country that is so well and so bravely defended by such patriots .
may god bless them , the living and the fallen , as he has blessed us with their service .
love greater than hate for their families , for their friends , for america , for mankind they sacrifice to affirm that right makes might ; that good triumphs over evil ; that freedom is stronger than tyranny ; that love is greater than hate .
it is left to us to keep their generous benefaction alive , and our blessed , beautiful country worthy of their courage .
we should be thankful - for the privilege .
our country 's security does n't depend on the heroism of every citizen .
but we have to be worthy of the sacrifices made on our behalf .
we have to love our freedom , not just for the material benefits it provides , not just for the autonomy it guarantees us , but for the goodness it makes possible .
we have to love it as much , if not as heroically , as the brave americans who defend us at the risk , and often the cost of their lives .
no american alive today will ever forget what happened on the morning of 11 september .
that day was the moment when the pendulum of history swung toward a new era .
the opening chapter was tinged with great sadness and uncertainty .
it shook us from our complacency in the belief that the cold war 's end had ushered in a time of global tranquillity .
but an absence of complacency should not provoke an absence of confidence .
what our enemies have sought to destroy is beyond their reach .
it can not be taken from us .
it can only be surrendered .
argument among friends my friends , we are again met on the field of political competition with our fellow countrymen .
it is more than appropriate , it is necessary that even in times of crisis we have these contests , and engage in spirited disagreement over the shape and course of our government .
we have nothing to fear from each other .
we are arguing over the means to better secure our freedom , and promote the general welfare .
but it should remain an argument among friends who share an unshaken belief in our great cause , and in the goodness of each other .
we are americans first , americans last , americans always .
let us argue our differences .
but remember we are not enemies , but comrades in a war against a real enemy , and take courage from the knowledge that our military superiority is matched only by the superiority of our ideals , and our unconquerable love for them .
our adversaries are weaker than us in arms and men , but weaker still in causes .
they fight to express a hatred for all that is good in humanity .
we fight for love of freedom and justice , a love that is invincible .
keep that faith .
keep your courage .
stick together .
stay strong .
do not yield .
do not flinch .
stand up .
stand up with our president and fight .
we 're americans .
we 're americans , and we 'll never surrender .
they will .

kevin newton , a mansfield businessman , already runs an elite squad of motorcyclists from the town .
his proposed centre at millennium park in mansfield would train up to 100 top-class riders .
he said the scheme has the backing of the county council and the east midlands development agency .
specialist training " we want to put together a centre where the riders and mechanics get specialist training - we do n't have any centres with formal training for superbike mechanics , " he said .
coun chris winterton of notts county council , who heads the economic generation committee , says the centre has a good chance of succeeding .
" if we can get the track screened and baffled against the noise - i think it is a great idea , " he said .
mr newton said : " in the uk the riders are not trained on how to ride or how the bike works , it is all knowledge that is usually passed down father to son .
" the mechanics all seem to be motorbike mechanics and not race mechanics because there is not training available .
" why should we move to donington park or silverstone when we have fantastic facilities in mansfield - why not have the next grand prix world champion based in mansfield , " he said .

crimes against badgers vary from baiting to disturbance .
in baiting or digging , the badgers are deliberately dug from their sets to be attacked by dogs such as terriers , lurchers and bull terriers .
badgers are also trapped or dug from their sets to be taken to a pre-designated area where a pit has been dug .
there the badger will fight against dogs , while money is bet on the outcome and the length of time it will be before the badger is killed .
badger baiting badgers can seriously injure or kill the dogs that are set upon them .
often their claws or teeth are pulled out with pliers , their jaws broken or the tendons on their legs cut to make them weaker .
other crimes include disturbance by developers , foresters , green keepers and cattle farmers .
however , the main aim of the campaign is to target baiting - a crime which has been taken underground and is well organised .
superintendent mike flynn , of the sspca , said : " this is possibly one of the cruellest and most violent acts carried out against animals in britain today .
' barbaric ' crime " the stress and suffering endured by both the badgers and the dogs involved can last for several hours before inevitable death .
" the people carrying out these acts can not be trusted .
they are barbaric and we are appealing to anyone who is aware of such cruelty to call the reward line and bring an end to this horrific activity . "
constable phil briggs , wildlife crime officer for strathclyde police , said those involved in badger baiting have no place in society .
he said : " this is a barbaric past-time which belongs in the dark ages .
the criminals involved in this have no regard for either the welfare of the badgers or the dogs they use .
" the police will continue to work closely with the sspca and scottish badgers to bring these despicable violent criminals to justice .
