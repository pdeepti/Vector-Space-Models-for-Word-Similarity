but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .

medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .

" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .

the event is designed to raise european awareness of the continent 's largest , but much-maligned minority . hosted by the association of european cultural institutes in berlin -lrb- gek -rrb- , the two-week festival will be showcasing a culture that 's all too often marginalized - for a range of deeply-entrenched social , political and religious reasons . the organizers , though , are at pains not to concentrate on the historical and ongoing persecution the roma and sinti have suffered , choosing instead to profile the minorities ' evolving cultural identity in the light of the recent eu eastwards enlargement . it 's a cause with increasing support .
the plight of the gypsies is an issue livia jaroka , the first roma member of the european parliament , has been lobbying to have placed at the top of the brussels agenda since her appointment in may . changing the roma and sinti image being shown in a positive light will be a novelty for these beleagured minorities .
today , europe 's 12 million sinti and roma live primarily in the former eastern block , where the turbulent break-up of nations into ethnicity-based states led irrevocably to their isolation and often deprived them of their citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin / tiergarten : romani rose , vorsitzender des zentralrates deutscher sinti und roma und helfer sammelten am sonabend bei strömendem regen unterschriften für den bau des nationalen holocaust-denkmals für die ermordeten sinti und roma .
damit solle deutlich gemacht werden , " dass es die sache der ganzen gesellschaft ist " , sagt rose .
als eine der ersten unterzeichnete renate künast , bundesvorsitzende der grünen , die liste .
vor der unterschriftenaktion hatten rund 150 prominente den appell unterzeichnet , darunter paul spiegel , chef des zentralrats der juden , alt-kanzler helmut schmidt und schriftsteller günter grass .

lesser-known victims of the nazi 's genocide programs , the roma and sinti issue recently became a topic of public debate in germany - home to some 70,000 of them - when activists called for a memorial to roma and sinti holocaust victims near berlin 's parliament building and the brandenburg gate . contemporary edge highlights of the festival include screenings of critically acclaimed films such as emir kusturica 's classic time of the gypsies and tony gadlif 's gadjo dilo ; exhibitions of work by artists including hungarian photographer david horváth , concerts by ensembles from slovakia , greece , the czech republic and poland , discussions and a reading by roma poet edward debicki from poland . " our aim is to present an authentic image of roma and sinti culture that proves it has a very lively tradition that 's not just about folklore , " agnes gelenscer from the hungarian culture institute , one of the organizers , told dw-world . " we want to illustrate that it has a contemporary dimension which is also visual , and not just music and dance-based , as the clichés suggest , " she pointed out . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . -lrb- may 16 , 2004 -rrb- roma mep urges commission to act for her people the first ever roma member of the european parliament has urged the european commission to start a concerted effort to improve living conditions for her people . -lrb- july 30 , 2004 -rrb- romania 's rocky path to respectability german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting romania on thursday : the country is still struggling to meet criteria for eu accession . -lrb- august 12 , 2004 -rrb- 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .
as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .

a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .

but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .

the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .

both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .

" in a weekend speech to the national italian-american foundation , powell lauded italy 's steadfast commitment to the us-led war in iraq , a conflict bitterly opposed by germany , and said washington would keep that in mind as it considers an upcoming report on un reform that is expected to recommend expanding the security council . " i can assure -lrb- you -rrb- that i am watching with great interest the report that will be forthcoming from the panel studying the reorganization of the un , " powell said in an address to the foundation 's annual dinner on saturday in washington . " and when that report comes forward and we see what it recommends and how large there might be in terms of an expansion of the security council , if any at all , you can be absolutely sure ... that italy will get every consideration , " he said .
" we do n't forget our friends . " germany , which infuriated us president george w. bush 's administration with its opposition to the iraq war , is lobbying hard for permanent membership on the council and has launched a joint campaign with three other nations - japan , brazil and india - to win such seats . italy wants eu seat but italy opposes germany 's bid on the grounds there should be a european union seat on the council and sees berlin 's initiative as divisive and following " national interests " at the expense of those of the eu bloc . in talks last week outside rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schröder failed to resolve the dispute which is likely to heat up in the coming weeks ahead of the december release of the report on un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york the us , along with britain , china , france and russia , hold permanent seats on the security council , with power to veto any matter brought before it . to date , the us has expressed support only for japan joining the security council as a permanent member and has been non-committal on other bids , although powell said earlier this month that brazil was a " solid " and " serious " candidate . praise for berlusconi while not directly endorsing italy 's position or mentioning germany 's candidacy , powell 's vow that washington would remember its " friends " in rome appeared to be a firm signal that berlin 's ambition for permanent council membership is not high on the us agenda . powell heaped praise on berlusconi for staying the course in iraq and keeping italy 's 3,000 troops there despite widespread domestic opposition to the war and the abductions by insurgents of italian citizens , at least one of whom , a journalist , was killed . " in all of these difficult months , never once has prime minister berlusconi or -lrb- foreign minister -rrb- franco frattini or anyone in the italian government blinked , " he said .
" not once did they stand back and say maybe we better take another look .
not once . " they 've always been with us , " powell said , according to a transcript of the remarks released by the state department .
" we draw strength from the shared conviction that our two countries are part of a noble mission . " italy is the third-biggest contributor to the us-led coalition in iraq but deployed its troops to the southern part of the country only after the us and britain had completed the military overthrow of saddam hussein 's regime . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform tops schröder 's talks with indian leaders german chancellor schröder has praised close indo-german cooperation on un reform and mutual support for their bids for permanent security council seats during talks with indian premier singh in delhi .

the event is designed to raise european awareness of the continent 's largest , but much-maligned minority . hosted by the association of european cultural institutes in berlin -lrb- gek -rrb- , the two-week festival will be showcasing a culture that 's all too often marginalized - for a range of deeply-entrenched social , political and religious reasons . the organizers , though , are at pains not to concentrate on the historical and ongoing persecution the roma and sinti have suffered , choosing instead to profile the minorities ' evolving cultural identity in the light of the recent eu eastwards enlargement . it 's a cause with increasing support .
the plight of the gypsies is an issue livia jaroka , the first roma member of the european parliament , has been lobbying to have placed at the top of the brussels agenda since her appointment in may . changing the roma and sinti image being shown in a positive light will be a novelty for these beleagured minorities .
today , europe 's 12 million sinti and roma live primarily in the former eastern block , where the turbulent break-up of nations into ethnicity-based states led irrevocably to their isolation and often deprived them of their citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin / tiergarten : romani rose , vorsitzender des zentralrates deutscher sinti und roma und helfer sammelten am sonabend bei strömendem regen unterschriften für den bau des nationalen holocaust-denkmals für die ermordeten sinti und roma .

vor der unterschriftenaktion hatten rund 150 prominente den appell unterzeichnet , darunter paul spiegel , chef des zentralrats der juden , alt-kanzler helmut schmidt und schriftsteller günter grass .

lesser-known victims of the nazi 's genocide programs , the roma and sinti issue recently became a topic of public debate in germany - home to some 70,000 of them - when activists called for a memorial to roma and sinti holocaust victims near berlin 's parliament building and the brandenburg gate . contemporary edge highlights of the festival include screenings of critically acclaimed films such as emir kusturica 's classic time of the gypsies and tony gadlif 's gadjo dilo ; exhibitions of work by artists including hungarian photographer david horváth , concerts by ensembles from slovakia , greece , the czech republic and poland , discussions and a reading by roma poet edward debicki from poland . " our aim is to present an authentic image of roma and sinti culture that proves it has a very lively tradition that 's not just about folklore , " agnes gelenscer from the hungarian culture institute , one of the organizers , told dw-world . " we want to illustrate that it has a contemporary dimension which is also visual , and not just music and dance-based , as the clichés suggest , " she pointed out . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . -lrb- may 16 , 2004 -rrb- roma mep urges commission to act for her people the first ever roma member of the european parliament has urged the european commission to start a concerted effort to improve living conditions for her people . -lrb- july 30 , 2004 -rrb- romania 's rocky path to respectability german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting romania on thursday : the country is still struggling to meet criteria for eu accession . -lrb- august 12 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you think europe needs to do more for its roma and sinti population ?

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

the event is designed to raise european awareness of the continent 's largest , but much-maligned minority . hosted by the association of european cultural institutes in berlin -lrb- gek -rrb- , the two-week festival will be showcasing a culture that 's all too often marginalized - for a range of deeply-entrenched social , political and religious reasons . the organizers , though , are at pains not to concentrate on the historical and ongoing persecution the roma and sinti have suffered , choosing instead to profile the minorities ' evolving cultural identity in the light of the recent eu eastwards enlargement . it 's a cause with increasing support .
the plight of the gypsies is an issue livia jaroka , the first roma member of the european parliament , has been lobbying to have placed at the top of the brussels agenda since her appointment in may . changing the roma and sinti image being shown in a positive light will be a novelty for these beleagured minorities .
today , europe 's 12 million sinti and roma live primarily in the former eastern block , where the turbulent break-up of nations into ethnicity-based states led irrevocably to their isolation and often deprived them of their citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin / tiergarten : romani rose , vorsitzender des zentralrates deutscher sinti und roma und helfer sammelten am sonabend bei strömendem regen unterschriften für den bau des nationalen holocaust-denkmals für die ermordeten sinti und roma .
damit solle deutlich gemacht werden , " dass es die sache der ganzen gesellschaft ist " , sagt rose .
als eine der ersten unterzeichnete renate künast , bundesvorsitzende der grünen , die liste .
vor der unterschriftenaktion hatten rund 150 prominente den appell unterzeichnet , darunter paul spiegel , chef des zentralrats der juden , alt-kanzler helmut schmidt und schriftsteller günter grass .

lesser-known victims of the nazi 's genocide programs , the roma and sinti issue recently became a topic of public debate in germany - home to some 70,000 of them - when activists called for a memorial to roma and sinti holocaust victims near berlin 's parliament building and the brandenburg gate . contemporary edge highlights of the festival include screenings of critically acclaimed films such as emir kusturica 's classic time of the gypsies and tony gadlif 's gadjo dilo ; exhibitions of work by artists including hungarian photographer david horváth , concerts by ensembles from slovakia , greece , the czech republic and poland , discussions and a reading by roma poet edward debicki from poland . " our aim is to present an authentic image of roma and sinti culture that proves it has a very lively tradition that 's not just about folklore , " agnes gelenscer from the hungarian culture institute , one of the organizers , told dw-world . " we want to illustrate that it has a contemporary dimension which is also visual , and not just music and dance-based , as the clichés suggest , " she pointed out . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . -lrb- may 16 , 2004 -rrb- roma mep urges commission to act for her people the first ever roma member of the european parliament has urged the european commission to start a concerted effort to improve living conditions for her people . -lrb- july 30 , 2004 -rrb- romania 's rocky path to respectability german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting romania on thursday : the country is still struggling to meet criteria for eu accession . -lrb- august 12 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you think europe needs to do more for its roma and sinti population ?

the event is designed to raise european awareness of the continent 's largest , but much-maligned minority . hosted by the association of european cultural institutes in berlin -lrb- gek -rrb- , the two-week festival will be showcasing a culture that 's all too often marginalized - for a range of deeply-entrenched social , political and religious reasons . the organizers , though , are at pains not to concentrate on the historical and ongoing persecution the roma and sinti have suffered , choosing instead to profile the minorities ' evolving cultural identity in the light of the recent eu eastwards enlargement . it 's a cause with increasing support .
the plight of the gypsies is an issue livia jaroka , the first roma member of the european parliament , has been lobbying to have placed at the top of the brussels agenda since her appointment in may . changing the roma and sinti image being shown in a positive light will be a novelty for these beleagured minorities .

" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .

but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .
" you can talk about better protection for non-smokers at the office , but the question is not allowed beforehand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the race for the white house bild backs bush kerry 's sister gets out the vote in europe former us treasurer campaigns for kerry foreign observers ready to monitor us elections germany -pipe- 19.10.2004 an overwhelming case for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i would hope to see german participation in iraq " former presidential foreign policy advisor richard perle told dw-world that no matter who wins the upcoming us election , germany must change its policy of non-participation in iraq . in berlin for a discussion at the american academy earlier this week , perle came out strong in support of the incumbent george w. bush .
the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

nevertheless , " compared with past periods of upturn , growth momentum remains weak , " they said . growth impulses were coming solely from abroad " and they have n't yet jumped over to the domestic demand , which has remained weak for an unusually long time , " the report said . it added that since the global upturn particularly in the united states and china is losing speed , the impulses for the german economy coming from exports can be expected to weaken . oil prices in particular constituted a " special risk " for the global economy , since they will put the brakes on private consumption , the institutes warned . the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce similarly predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year . based on the results of its regular survey of 25,000 companies , dihk said it was forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2005 , down from just under 2.0 percent this year . nevertheless , that was still an achievement in view of the fact that the german economy stagnated for three years until 2003 , dihk president martin wansleben noted . the economy " will continue to make progress in 2005 , albeit bit by bit , " he said . slowdown in exports in its october monthly report , published monday , germany 's bundesbank estimated that economic growth in germany has slowed in the third quarter of this year as exports - the main engine behind growth in the previous quarters - have hit a wall .

nevertheless , " compared with past periods of upturn , growth momentum remains weak , " they said . growth impulses were coming solely from abroad " and they have n't yet jumped over to the domestic demand , which has remained weak for an unusually long time , " the report said . it added that since the global upturn particularly in the united states and china is losing speed , the impulses for the german economy coming from exports can be expected to weaken . oil prices in particular constituted a " special risk " for the global economy , since they will put the brakes on private consumption , the institutes warned . the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce similarly predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year . based on the results of its regular survey of 25,000 companies , dihk said it was forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2005 , down from just under 2.0 percent this year . nevertheless , that was still an achievement in view of the fact that the german economy stagnated for three years until 2003 , dihk president martin wansleben noted . the economy " will continue to make progress in 2005 , albeit bit by bit , " he said . slowdown in exports in its october monthly report , published monday , germany 's bundesbank estimated that economic growth in germany has slowed in the third quarter of this year as exports - the main engine behind growth in the previous quarters - have hit a wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.10.2004 job requirement : non-smoker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking : one more reason not to hire someone a series of anti-smoking measures have initiated a sea change in smoking attitudes in germany .
but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .
" you can talk about better protection for non-smokers at the office , but the question is not allowed beforehand . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.10.2004 a story of keeping pace and hopes alive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart keep on wolfsburg 's tail in the tight contest at the top the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .
while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .
with both teams sharing such close proximity , anything less than a win would see them change places and risk making that third relegation place their very own . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday .

while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .
with both teams sharing such close proximity , anything less than a win would see them change places and risk making that third relegation place their very own . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday .

bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .
with both teams sharing such close proximity , anything less than a win would see them change places and risk making that third relegation place their very own . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday .

while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .

the german producer price index -lrb- ppi -rrb- , which measures the price of goods at the factory gate and is a key yardstick of pipeline inflation , rose by 2.3 percent on a 12-month basis in september , the strongest annual increase since august 2001 , destatis said in a statement .
the index had already risen by 2.2 percent in august and by 1.9 percent in july .
" as in previous months , the development is attributable primarily to the rise in oil prices and the increase in steel prices observed since the beginning of the year , " the statisticians said .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .
as negotiations continued , neither side was giving ground .

" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .

a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .

of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .

the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .

of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .
" you can talk about better protection for non-smokers at the office , but the question is not allowed beforehand .

the event is designed to raise european awareness of the continent 's largest , but much-maligned minority . hosted by the association of european cultural institutes in berlin -lrb- gek -rrb- , the two-week festival will be showcasing a culture that 's all too often marginalized - for a range of deeply-entrenched social , political and religious reasons . the organizers , though , are at pains not to concentrate on the historical and ongoing persecution the roma and sinti have suffered , choosing instead to profile the minorities ' evolving cultural identity in the light of the recent eu eastwards enlargement . it 's a cause with increasing support .
the plight of the gypsies is an issue livia jaroka , the first roma member of the european parliament , has been lobbying to have placed at the top of the brussels agenda since her appointment in may . changing the roma and sinti image being shown in a positive light will be a novelty for these beleagured minorities .
today , europe 's 12 million sinti and roma live primarily in the former eastern block , where the turbulent break-up of nations into ethnicity-based states led irrevocably to their isolation and often deprived them of their citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin / tiergarten : romani rose , vorsitzender des zentralrates deutscher sinti und roma und helfer sammelten am sonabend bei strömendem regen unterschriften für den bau des nationalen holocaust-denkmals für die ermordeten sinti und roma .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .
" you can talk about better protection for non-smokers at the office , but the question is not allowed beforehand .

nevertheless , " compared with past periods of upturn , growth momentum remains weak , " they said . growth impulses were coming solely from abroad " and they have n't yet jumped over to the domestic demand , which has remained weak for an unusually long time , " the report said . it added that since the global upturn particularly in the united states and china is losing speed , the impulses for the german economy coming from exports can be expected to weaken . oil prices in particular constituted a " special risk " for the global economy , since they will put the brakes on private consumption , the institutes warned . the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce similarly predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year . based on the results of its regular survey of 25,000 companies , dihk said it was forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2005 , down from just under 2.0 percent this year . nevertheless , that was still an achievement in view of the fact that the german economy stagnated for three years until 2003 , dihk president martin wansleben noted . the economy " will continue to make progress in 2005 , albeit bit by bit , " he said . slowdown in exports in its october monthly report , published monday , germany 's bundesbank estimated that economic growth in germany has slowed in the third quarter of this year as exports - the main engine behind growth in the previous quarters - have hit a wall .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .

" about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .

both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .

in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .

" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .

both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .

in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .

nevertheless , " compared with past periods of upturn , growth momentum remains weak , " they said . growth impulses were coming solely from abroad " and they have n't yet jumped over to the domestic demand , which has remained weak for an unusually long time , " the report said . it added that since the global upturn particularly in the united states and china is losing speed , the impulses for the german economy coming from exports can be expected to weaken . oil prices in particular constituted a " special risk " for the global economy , since they will put the brakes on private consumption , the institutes warned . the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce similarly predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year . based on the results of its regular survey of 25,000 companies , dihk said it was forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2005 , down from just under 2.0 percent this year . nevertheless , that was still an achievement in view of the fact that the german economy stagnated for three years until 2003 , dihk president martin wansleben noted . the economy " will continue to make progress in 2005 , albeit bit by bit , " he said . slowdown in exports in its october monthly report , published monday , germany 's bundesbank estimated that economic growth in germany has slowed in the third quarter of this year as exports - the main engine behind growth in the previous quarters - have hit a wall . " compared with the preceding quarter when growth reached 0.5 percent , the momentum is likely to have lessened somewhat , " the german central bank wrote . gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in germany expanded by 0.4 percent in the first three months of the current year and growth picked up fractionally to 0.5 percent in following three months . the anticipated slowdown in the third quarter was largely attributable to " somewhat calmer overseas demand " for german-made goods , the bundesbank said . " domestic demand has not been able to compensate for this , even if household spending has picked up somewhat compared with the spring , " the bank wrote . high oil prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in its monthly report , the bundesbank also warned that oil prices , one of the main culprits behind slowing global growth , could remain high for some time to come . " on the international oil markets , prices have shot up as far as 50 dollars per barrel in recent weeks , " the bank wrote .
" in fact , given continued strong international demand and restricted capacity reserves , the impression has arisen that oil prices will remain high for a long time . " on monday , oil prices shot up to a new record high of more than $ 55 -lrb- € 44.71 -rrb- per barrel . the bundesbank 's comments appear to differ from the official view of the european central bank which has so far said the rise in the price of oil has been exaggerated and will soon start to come down . indeed , a top ecb official said in a newspaper interview monday that the guardian of the euro was still confident that the conditions for recovery remained intact . " naturally , uncertainty has increased as a result of oil prices and of a few mixed economic signals , " ecb executive board member jose manuel gonzales-paramo told the german business daily handelsblatt . " but i do n't believe so far that we have to alter our forecasts , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.10.2004 job requirement : non-smoker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking : one more reason not to hire someone a series of anti-smoking measures have initiated a sea change in smoking attitudes in germany .
but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .

the event is designed to raise european awareness of the continent 's largest , but much-maligned minority . hosted by the association of european cultural institutes in berlin -lrb- gek -rrb- , the two-week festival will be showcasing a culture that 's all too often marginalized - for a range of deeply-entrenched social , political and religious reasons . the organizers , though , are at pains not to concentrate on the historical and ongoing persecution the roma and sinti have suffered , choosing instead to profile the minorities ' evolving cultural identity in the light of the recent eu eastwards enlargement . it 's a cause with increasing support .
the plight of the gypsies is an issue livia jaroka , the first roma member of the european parliament , has been lobbying to have placed at the top of the brussels agenda since her appointment in may . changing the roma and sinti image being shown in a positive light will be a novelty for these beleagured minorities .
today , europe 's 12 million sinti and roma live primarily in the former eastern block , where the turbulent break-up of nations into ethnicity-based states led irrevocably to their isolation and often deprived them of their citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin / tiergarten : romani rose , vorsitzender des zentralrates deutscher sinti und roma und helfer sammelten am sonabend bei strömendem regen unterschriften für den bau des nationalen holocaust-denkmals für die ermordeten sinti und roma .
damit solle deutlich gemacht werden , " dass es die sache der ganzen gesellschaft ist " , sagt rose .
als eine der ersten unterzeichnete renate künast , bundesvorsitzende der grünen , die liste .
vor der unterschriftenaktion hatten rund 150 prominente den appell unterzeichnet , darunter paul spiegel , chef des zentralrats der juden , alt-kanzler helmut schmidt und schriftsteller günter grass .

lesser-known victims of the nazi 's genocide programs , the roma and sinti issue recently became a topic of public debate in germany - home to some 70,000 of them - when activists called for a memorial to roma and sinti holocaust victims near berlin 's parliament building and the brandenburg gate . contemporary edge highlights of the festival include screenings of critically acclaimed films such as emir kusturica 's classic time of the gypsies and tony gadlif 's gadjo dilo ; exhibitions of work by artists including hungarian photographer david horváth , concerts by ensembles from slovakia , greece , the czech republic and poland , discussions and a reading by roma poet edward debicki from poland . " our aim is to present an authentic image of roma and sinti culture that proves it has a very lively tradition that 's not just about folklore , " agnes gelenscer from the hungarian culture institute , one of the organizers , told dw-world . " we want to illustrate that it has a contemporary dimension which is also visual , and not just music and dance-based , as the clichés suggest , " she pointed out . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . -lrb- may 16 , 2004 -rrb- roma mep urges commission to act for her people the first ever roma member of the european parliament has urged the european commission to start a concerted effort to improve living conditions for her people . -lrb- july 30 , 2004 -rrb- romania 's rocky path to respectability german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting romania on thursday : the country is still struggling to meet criteria for eu accession . -lrb- august 12 , 2004 -rrb- media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

his nomination has already been rejected by a committee in the european parliament - and socialists and liberal meps are now demanding that , at the very least , buttiglione is given a new portfolio .
according to parliament sources , there are a few options on the table .
one would be make sure that issues infringing on article 13 of the treaty , which deals with discrimination based on sex , religion and sexual orientation , do not fall in buttiglione 's remit .
however , according to one senior mep , this would be the " least satisfactory " option as buttiglione would still be under constant scrutiny for everything he said for the next five years .
another option , which would gain greater support from liberals and left meps , would be a direct swap of portfolios .

the event is designed to raise european awareness of the continent 's largest , but much-maligned minority . hosted by the association of european cultural institutes in berlin -lrb- gek -rrb- , the two-week festival will be showcasing a culture that 's all too often marginalized - for a range of deeply-entrenched social , political and religious reasons . the organizers , though , are at pains not to concentrate on the historical and ongoing persecution the roma and sinti have suffered , choosing instead to profile the minorities ' evolving cultural identity in the light of the recent eu eastwards enlargement . it 's a cause with increasing support .
the plight of the gypsies is an issue livia jaroka , the first roma member of the european parliament , has been lobbying to have placed at the top of the brussels agenda since her appointment in may . changing the roma and sinti image being shown in a positive light will be a novelty for these beleagured minorities .
today , europe 's 12 million sinti and roma live primarily in the former eastern block , where the turbulent break-up of nations into ethnicity-based states led irrevocably to their isolation and often deprived them of their citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin / tiergarten : romani rose , vorsitzender des zentralrates deutscher sinti und roma und helfer sammelten am sonabend bei strömendem regen unterschriften für den bau des nationalen holocaust-denkmals für die ermordeten sinti und roma .
damit solle deutlich gemacht werden , " dass es die sache der ganzen gesellschaft ist " , sagt rose .
als eine der ersten unterzeichnete renate künast , bundesvorsitzende der grünen , die liste .
vor der unterschriftenaktion hatten rund 150 prominente den appell unterzeichnet , darunter paul spiegel , chef des zentralrats der juden , alt-kanzler helmut schmidt und schriftsteller günter grass .

lesser-known victims of the nazi 's genocide programs , the roma and sinti issue recently became a topic of public debate in germany - home to some 70,000 of them - when activists called for a memorial to roma and sinti holocaust victims near berlin 's parliament building and the brandenburg gate . contemporary edge highlights of the festival include screenings of critically acclaimed films such as emir kusturica 's classic time of the gypsies and tony gadlif 's gadjo dilo ; exhibitions of work by artists including hungarian photographer david horváth , concerts by ensembles from slovakia , greece , the czech republic and poland , discussions and a reading by roma poet edward debicki from poland . " our aim is to present an authentic image of roma and sinti culture that proves it has a very lively tradition that 's not just about folklore , " agnes gelenscer from the hungarian culture institute , one of the organizers , told dw-world . " we want to illustrate that it has a contemporary dimension which is also visual , and not just music and dance-based , as the clichés suggest , " she pointed out . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . -lrb- may 16 , 2004 -rrb- roma mep urges commission to act for her people the first ever roma member of the european parliament has urged the european commission to start a concerted effort to improve living conditions for her people . -lrb- july 30 , 2004 -rrb- romania 's rocky path to respectability german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting romania on thursday : the country is still struggling to meet criteria for eu accession . -lrb- august 12 , 2004 -rrb- media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .
and that 's apparent to the clients . " medica mondiale contends that the clients , german soldiers included , are complicit in the abuse of minors because they are obviously aware of how young the girls are and the prison-like conditions they live in . peacekeeping troops complicit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo .
medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .
members of the german kfor troops based in pristina would confirm the charges under the condition of anonymity , she claimed . filip slavkovic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition criticizes foreign military assignments german opposition politicians have called on the government to formulate a clearer policy for foreign military deployments after a report criticized bundeswehr peacekeeping troops in kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.10.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc barroso reticent on buttiglione at a meeting in dublin on monday , barroso refused to repeat an earlier statement that rocco buttiglione was " perfectly fit " for the post of justice and home affairs commissioner , according to the irish times .
barroso ’ s reticence was also relayed via his spokeswoman in brussels .
" barroso continues to be confident that at the end of this process , his team can receive the approval of the european parliament , " said pia ahrenkilde hansen , who refused to clarify whether this would include buttiglione and his current portfolio .
the italian commissioner , a conservative catholic , has hardly left the news lately following a series of controversial comments on gays , women and marriage , and single mothers .
his nomination has already been rejected by a committee in the european parliament - and socialists and liberal meps are now demanding that , at the very least , buttiglione is given a new portfolio .
according to parliament sources , there are a few options on the table .
one would be make sure that issues infringing on article 13 of the treaty , which deals with discrimination based on sex , religion and sexual orientation , do not fall in buttiglione 's remit .
however , according to one senior mep , this would be the " least satisfactory " option as buttiglione would still be under constant scrutiny for everything he said for the next five years .
another option , which would gain greater support from liberals and left meps , would be a direct swap of portfolios .
one name that has cropped up for such an exchange would be with french commissioner jacques barrot , who is to be in charge of transport .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .

medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .

medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .

it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.10.2004 germany , portugal favor eu talks with turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two votes for starting talks with ankara meeting in lisbon on tuesday , german chancellor gerhard schröder and portuguese prime minister pedro santana lopes said they would support beginning membership talks with turkey when eu leaders gather in december . " at the eu summit in december , i will back the position recommended by the european commission , " schröder said at a news conference following talks in lisbon with his portuguese colleague santana lopes .
earlier this month the european union executive gave the green light to begin accession talks with istanbul .
in a progress report and impact study issued oct .
6 , the commission said no other real problems stood in the way of starting the negotiation process , but warned that the enlargement talks could be broken off at any point if turkey backtracks on its reform progress .
not a unanimous vote the commission 's recommendations are expected to form the basis for discussion at a dec .
17 summit when all 25 eu leaders vote on whether to allow entry negotiations to begin .
" we are going to back the findings of the eu commission on this issue , " said santana lopes , adding his country 's vote to those favoring at least opening the talks with ankara .
entry talks , however , are far from certain as sentiment is split across the member states and among the national political parties .
in germany , support is divided between schröder 's governing coalition and the conservative opposition , which on tuesday voted nearly unanimously to oppose turkish membership in the eu .
in france , president jacques chirac favors starting talks with turkey and holding a national referendum on membership , but his government is only lukewarm on the issue .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appealed to paris to show the " necessary support " in the run-up to the december summit , saying france is a country with " close and friendly ties to turkey . "
both erdogan and turkish foreign minister abdullah gül have been crisscrossing the eu , visiting with heads of government and party leaders in the hopes of drumming up support from the biggest players in the bloc .
anything less than full membership " does not interest us , " said gül after meeting with opposition leaders in germany . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey membership splits eu now that the european commission has given its nod to ankara , eu leaders are set to make a final decision on starting accession talks at a december summit .

" at the eu summit in december , i will back the position recommended by the european commission , " schröder said at a news conference following talks in lisbon with his portuguese colleague santana lopes .
earlier this month the european union executive gave the green light to begin accession talks with istanbul .
in a progress report and impact study issued oct .
6 , the commission said no other real problems stood in the way of starting the negotiation process , but warned that the enlargement talks could be broken off at any point if turkey backtracks on its reform progress .
not a unanimous vote the commission 's recommendations are expected to form the basis for discussion at a dec .
17 summit when all 25 eu leaders vote on whether to allow entry negotiations to begin .
" we are going to back the findings of the eu commission on this issue , " said santana lopes , adding his country 's vote to those favoring at least opening the talks with ankara .
entry talks , however , are far from certain as sentiment is split across the member states and among the national political parties .
in germany , support is divided between schröder 's governing coalition and the conservative opposition , which on tuesday voted nearly unanimously to oppose turkish membership in the eu .
in france , president jacques chirac favors starting talks with turkey and holding a national referendum on membership , but his government is only lukewarm on the issue .
turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan appealed to paris to show the " necessary support " in the run-up to the december summit , saying france is a country with " close and friendly ties to turkey . "
both erdogan and turkish foreign minister abdullah gül have been crisscrossing the eu , visiting with heads of government and party leaders in the hopes of drumming up support from the biggest players in the bloc .
anything less than full membership " does not interest us , " said gül after meeting with opposition leaders in germany . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey membership splits eu now that the european commission has given its nod to ankara , eu leaders are set to make a final decision on starting accession talks at a december summit .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

in the competition in wehnde , thuringia , on sunday , nico morawa beat the former record of 65.80 meters , set four years by heiko scholl .
both men are from kamenz in the eastern state of saxony .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

" in a weekend speech to the national italian-american foundation , powell lauded italy 's steadfast commitment to the us-led war in iraq , a conflict bitterly opposed by germany , and said washington would keep that in mind as it considers an upcoming report on un reform that is expected to recommend expanding the security council . " i can assure -lrb- you -rrb- that i am watching with great interest the report that will be forthcoming from the panel studying the reorganization of the un , " powell said in an address to the foundation 's annual dinner on saturday in washington . " and when that report comes forward and we see what it recommends and how large there might be in terms of an expansion of the security council , if any at all , you can be absolutely sure ... that italy will get every consideration , " he said .
" we do n't forget our friends . " germany , which infuriated us president george w. bush 's administration with its opposition to the iraq war , is lobbying hard for permanent membership on the council and has launched a joint campaign with three other nations - japan , brazil and india - to win such seats . italy wants eu seat but italy opposes germany 's bid on the grounds there should be a european union seat on the council and sees berlin 's initiative as divisive and following " national interests " at the expense of those of the eu bloc . in talks last week outside rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schröder failed to resolve the dispute which is likely to heat up in the coming weeks ahead of the december release of the report on un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york the us , along with britain , china , france and russia , hold permanent seats on the security council , with power to veto any matter brought before it . to date , the us has expressed support only for japan joining the security council as a permanent member and has been non-committal on other bids , although powell said earlier this month that brazil was a " solid " and " serious " candidate . praise for berlusconi while not directly endorsing italy 's position or mentioning germany 's candidacy , powell 's vow that washington would remember its " friends " in rome appeared to be a firm signal that berlin 's ambition for permanent council membership is not high on the us agenda . powell heaped praise on berlusconi for staying the course in iraq and keeping italy 's 3,000 troops there despite widespread domestic opposition to the war and the abductions by insurgents of italian citizens , at least one of whom , a journalist , was killed . " in all of these difficult months , never once has prime minister berlusconi or -lrb- foreign minister -rrb- franco frattini or anyone in the italian government blinked , " he said .
" not once did they stand back and say maybe we better take another look .
not once . " they 've always been with us , " powell said , according to a transcript of the remarks released by the state department .
" we draw strength from the shared conviction that our two countries are part of a noble mission . " italy is the third-biggest contributor to the us-led coalition in iraq but deployed its troops to the southern part of the country only after the us and britain had completed the military overthrow of saddam hussein 's regime . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform tops schröder 's talks with indian leaders german chancellor schröder has praised close indo-german cooperation on un reform and mutual support for their bids for permanent security council seats during talks with indian premier singh in delhi .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.10.2004 a story of keeping pace and hopes alive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart keep on wolfsburg 's tail in the tight contest at the top the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .
while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .
with both teams sharing such close proximity , anything less than a win would see them change places and risk making that third relegation place their very own . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday .

while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .
with both teams sharing such close proximity , anything less than a win would see them change places and risk making that third relegation place their very own . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday .

sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .

battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .
with both teams sharing such close proximity , anything less than a win would see them change places and risk making that third relegation place their very own . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday .

his doctor at the max planck institute for psychiatry in munich said at the time that pressure to live up to expectations and the fight against injuries as well as private problems had taken their toll .
after publicly admitting to psychological problems in november 2003 , deisler underwent treatment before making a successful comeback .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.10.2004 job requirement : non-smoker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking : one more reason not to hire someone a series of anti-smoking measures have initiated a sea change in smoking attitudes in germany .
but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .

nevertheless , " compared with past periods of upturn , growth momentum remains weak , " they said . growth impulses were coming solely from abroad " and they have n't yet jumped over to the domestic demand , which has remained weak for an unusually long time , " the report said . it added that since the global upturn particularly in the united states and china is losing speed , the impulses for the german economy coming from exports can be expected to weaken . oil prices in particular constituted a " special risk " for the global economy , since they will put the brakes on private consumption , the institutes warned . the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce similarly predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year . based on the results of its regular survey of 25,000 companies , dihk said it was forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2005 , down from just under 2.0 percent this year . nevertheless , that was still an achievement in view of the fact that the german economy stagnated for three years until 2003 , dihk president martin wansleben noted . the economy " will continue to make progress in 2005 , albeit bit by bit , " he said . slowdown in exports in its october monthly report , published monday , germany 's bundesbank estimated that economic growth in germany has slowed in the third quarter of this year as exports - the main engine behind growth in the previous quarters - have hit a wall . " compared with the preceding quarter when growth reached 0.5 percent , the momentum is likely to have lessened somewhat , " the german central bank wrote . gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in germany expanded by 0.4 percent in the first three months of the current year and growth picked up fractionally to 0.5 percent in following three months . the anticipated slowdown in the third quarter was largely attributable to " somewhat calmer overseas demand " for german-made goods , the bundesbank said . " domestic demand has not been able to compensate for this , even if household spending has picked up somewhat compared with the spring , " the bank wrote . high oil prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in its monthly report , the bundesbank also warned that oil prices , one of the main culprits behind slowing global growth , could remain high for some time to come . " on the international oil markets , prices have shot up as far as 50 dollars per barrel in recent weeks , " the bank wrote .
" in fact , given continued strong international demand and restricted capacity reserves , the impression has arisen that oil prices will remain high for a long time . " on monday , oil prices shot up to a new record high of more than $ 55 -lrb- € 44.71 -rrb- per barrel . the bundesbank 's comments appear to differ from the official view of the european central bank which has so far said the rise in the price of oil has been exaggerated and will soon start to come down . indeed , a top ecb official said in a newspaper interview monday that the guardian of the euro was still confident that the conditions for recovery remained intact . " naturally , uncertainty has increased as a result of oil prices and of a few mixed economic signals , " ecb executive board member jose manuel gonzales-paramo told the german business daily handelsblatt .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .

while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .

a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .
with both teams sharing such close proximity , anything less than a win would see them change places and risk making that third relegation place their very own . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday .

battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .
with both teams sharing such close proximity , anything less than a win would see them change places and risk making that third relegation place their very own . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .
and that 's apparent to the clients . " medica mondiale contends that the clients , german soldiers included , are complicit in the abuse of minors because they are obviously aware of how young the girls are and the prison-like conditions they live in . peacekeeping troops complicit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo .
medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .

" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .
and that 's apparent to the clients . " medica mondiale contends that the clients , german soldiers included , are complicit in the abuse of minors because they are obviously aware of how young the girls are and the prison-like conditions they live in . peacekeeping troops complicit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo .
medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .
members of the german kfor troops based in pristina would confirm the charges under the condition of anonymity , she claimed . filip slavkovic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition criticizes foreign military assignments german opposition politicians have called on the government to formulate a clearer policy for foreign military deployments after a report criticized bundeswehr peacekeeping troops in kosovo .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .
and that 's apparent to the clients . " medica mondiale contends that the clients , german soldiers included , are complicit in the abuse of minors because they are obviously aware of how young the girls are and the prison-like conditions they live in . peacekeeping troops complicit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo .
medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .
members of the german kfor troops based in pristina would confirm the charges under the condition of anonymity , she claimed . filip slavkovic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition criticizes foreign military assignments german opposition politicians have called on the government to formulate a clearer policy for foreign military deployments after a report criticized bundeswehr peacekeeping troops in kosovo .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .
" you can talk about better protection for non-smokers at the office , but the question is not allowed beforehand . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .
" you can talk about better protection for non-smokers at the office , but the question is not allowed beforehand . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .
but iceland and britain are in for praise .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .

" in a weekend speech to the national italian-american foundation , powell lauded italy 's steadfast commitment to the us-led war in iraq , a conflict bitterly opposed by germany , and said washington would keep that in mind as it considers an upcoming report on un reform that is expected to recommend expanding the security council . " i can assure -lrb- you -rrb- that i am watching with great interest the report that will be forthcoming from the panel studying the reorganization of the un , " powell said in an address to the foundation 's annual dinner on saturday in washington . " and when that report comes forward and we see what it recommends and how large there might be in terms of an expansion of the security council , if any at all , you can be absolutely sure ... that italy will get every consideration , " he said .
" we do n't forget our friends . " germany , which infuriated us president george w. bush 's administration with its opposition to the iraq war , is lobbying hard for permanent membership on the council and has launched a joint campaign with three other nations - japan , brazil and india - to win such seats . italy wants eu seat but italy opposes germany 's bid on the grounds there should be a european union seat on the council and sees berlin 's initiative as divisive and following " national interests " at the expense of those of the eu bloc . in talks last week outside rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schröder failed to resolve the dispute which is likely to heat up in the coming weeks ahead of the december release of the report on un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york the us , along with britain , china , france and russia , hold permanent seats on the security council , with power to veto any matter brought before it . to date , the us has expressed support only for japan joining the security council as a permanent member and has been non-committal on other bids , although powell said earlier this month that brazil was a " solid " and " serious " candidate . praise for berlusconi while not directly endorsing italy 's position or mentioning germany 's candidacy , powell 's vow that washington would remember its " friends " in rome appeared to be a firm signal that berlin 's ambition for permanent council membership is not high on the us agenda . powell heaped praise on berlusconi for staying the course in iraq and keeping italy 's 3,000 troops there despite widespread domestic opposition to the war and the abductions by insurgents of italian citizens , at least one of whom , a journalist , was killed . " in all of these difficult months , never once has prime minister berlusconi or -lrb- foreign minister -rrb- franco frattini or anyone in the italian government blinked , " he said .
" not once did they stand back and say maybe we better take another look .
not once . " they 've always been with us , " powell said , according to a transcript of the remarks released by the state department .
" we draw strength from the shared conviction that our two countries are part of a noble mission .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.10.2004 a story of keeping pace and hopes alive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart keep on wolfsburg 's tail in the tight contest at the top the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .
while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .

while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .
and that 's apparent to the clients . " medica mondiale contends that the clients , german soldiers included , are complicit in the abuse of minors because they are obviously aware of how young the girls are and the prison-like conditions they live in . peacekeeping troops complicit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo .
medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .
members of the german kfor troops based in pristina would confirm the charges under the condition of anonymity , she claimed . filip slavkovic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition criticizes foreign military assignments german opposition politicians have called on the government to formulate a clearer policy for foreign military deployments after a report criticized bundeswehr peacekeeping troops in kosovo .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .
and that 's apparent to the clients . " medica mondiale contends that the clients , german soldiers included , are complicit in the abuse of minors because they are obviously aware of how young the girls are and the prison-like conditions they live in . peacekeeping troops complicit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo .
medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .

nevertheless , " compared with past periods of upturn , growth momentum remains weak , " they said . growth impulses were coming solely from abroad " and they have n't yet jumped over to the domestic demand , which has remained weak for an unusually long time , " the report said . it added that since the global upturn particularly in the united states and china is losing speed , the impulses for the german economy coming from exports can be expected to weaken . oil prices in particular constituted a " special risk " for the global economy , since they will put the brakes on private consumption , the institutes warned . the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce similarly predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year . based on the results of its regular survey of 25,000 companies , dihk said it was forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2005 , down from just under 2.0 percent this year . nevertheless , that was still an achievement in view of the fact that the german economy stagnated for three years until 2003 , dihk president martin wansleben noted . the economy " will continue to make progress in 2005 , albeit bit by bit , " he said . slowdown in exports in its october monthly report , published monday , germany 's bundesbank estimated that economic growth in germany has slowed in the third quarter of this year as exports - the main engine behind growth in the previous quarters - have hit a wall . " compared with the preceding quarter when growth reached 0.5 percent , the momentum is likely to have lessened somewhat , " the german central bank wrote . gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in germany expanded by 0.4 percent in the first three months of the current year and growth picked up fractionally to 0.5 percent in following three months . the anticipated slowdown in the third quarter was largely attributable to " somewhat calmer overseas demand " for german-made goods , the bundesbank said . " domestic demand has not been able to compensate for this , even if household spending has picked up somewhat compared with the spring , " the bank wrote . high oil prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in its monthly report , the bundesbank also warned that oil prices , one of the main culprits behind slowing global growth , could remain high for some time to come . " on the international oil markets , prices have shot up as far as 50 dollars per barrel in recent weeks , " the bank wrote .
" in fact , given continued strong international demand and restricted capacity reserves , the impression has arisen that oil prices will remain high for a long time . " on monday , oil prices shot up to a new record high of more than $ 55 -lrb- € 44.71 -rrb- per barrel . the bundesbank 's comments appear to differ from the official view of the european central bank which has so far said the rise in the price of oil has been exaggerated and will soon start to come down . indeed , a top ecb official said in a newspaper interview monday that the guardian of the euro was still confident that the conditions for recovery remained intact . " naturally , uncertainty has increased as a result of oil prices and of a few mixed economic signals , " ecb executive board member jose manuel gonzales-paramo told the german business daily handelsblatt .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

" in a weekend speech to the national italian-american foundation , powell lauded italy 's steadfast commitment to the us-led war in iraq , a conflict bitterly opposed by germany , and said washington would keep that in mind as it considers an upcoming report on un reform that is expected to recommend expanding the security council . " i can assure -lrb- you -rrb- that i am watching with great interest the report that will be forthcoming from the panel studying the reorganization of the un , " powell said in an address to the foundation 's annual dinner on saturday in washington . " and when that report comes forward and we see what it recommends and how large there might be in terms of an expansion of the security council , if any at all , you can be absolutely sure ... that italy will get every consideration , " he said .
" we do n't forget our friends . " germany , which infuriated us president george w. bush 's administration with its opposition to the iraq war , is lobbying hard for permanent membership on the council and has launched a joint campaign with three other nations - japan , brazil and india - to win such seats . italy wants eu seat but italy opposes germany 's bid on the grounds there should be a european union seat on the council and sees berlin 's initiative as divisive and following " national interests " at the expense of those of the eu bloc . in talks last week outside rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schröder failed to resolve the dispute which is likely to heat up in the coming weeks ahead of the december release of the report on un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york the us , along with britain , china , france and russia , hold permanent seats on the security council , with power to veto any matter brought before it . to date , the us has expressed support only for japan joining the security council as a permanent member and has been non-committal on other bids , although powell said earlier this month that brazil was a " solid " and " serious " candidate . praise for berlusconi while not directly endorsing italy 's position or mentioning germany 's candidacy , powell 's vow that washington would remember its " friends " in rome appeared to be a firm signal that berlin 's ambition for permanent council membership is not high on the us agenda . powell heaped praise on berlusconi for staying the course in iraq and keeping italy 's 3,000 troops there despite widespread domestic opposition to the war and the abductions by insurgents of italian citizens , at least one of whom , a journalist , was killed . " in all of these difficult months , never once has prime minister berlusconi or -lrb- foreign minister -rrb- franco frattini or anyone in the italian government blinked , " he said .
" not once did they stand back and say maybe we better take another look .
not once . " they 've always been with us , " powell said , according to a transcript of the remarks released by the state department .
" we draw strength from the shared conviction that our two countries are part of a noble mission . " italy is the third-biggest contributor to the us-led coalition in iraq but deployed its troops to the southern part of the country only after the us and britain had completed the military overthrow of saddam hussein 's regime . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform tops schröder 's talks with indian leaders german chancellor schröder has praised close indo-german cooperation on un reform and mutual support for their bids for permanent security council seats during talks with indian premier singh in delhi .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .

both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

" in a weekend speech to the national italian-american foundation , powell lauded italy 's steadfast commitment to the us-led war in iraq , a conflict bitterly opposed by germany , and said washington would keep that in mind as it considers an upcoming report on un reform that is expected to recommend expanding the security council . " i can assure -lrb- you -rrb- that i am watching with great interest the report that will be forthcoming from the panel studying the reorganization of the un , " powell said in an address to the foundation 's annual dinner on saturday in washington . " and when that report comes forward and we see what it recommends and how large there might be in terms of an expansion of the security council , if any at all , you can be absolutely sure ... that italy will get every consideration , " he said .
" we do n't forget our friends . " germany , which infuriated us president george w. bush 's administration with its opposition to the iraq war , is lobbying hard for permanent membership on the council and has launched a joint campaign with three other nations - japan , brazil and india - to win such seats . italy wants eu seat but italy opposes germany 's bid on the grounds there should be a european union seat on the council and sees berlin 's initiative as divisive and following " national interests " at the expense of those of the eu bloc . in talks last week outside rome , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi and german chancellor gerhard schröder failed to resolve the dispute which is likely to heat up in the coming weeks ahead of the december release of the report on un reform . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council at united nations headquarters in new york the us , along with britain , china , france and russia , hold permanent seats on the security council , with power to veto any matter brought before it . to date , the us has expressed support only for japan joining the security council as a permanent member and has been non-committal on other bids , although powell said earlier this month that brazil was a " solid " and " serious " candidate . praise for berlusconi while not directly endorsing italy 's position or mentioning germany 's candidacy , powell 's vow that washington would remember its " friends " in rome appeared to be a firm signal that berlin 's ambition for permanent council membership is not high on the us agenda . powell heaped praise on berlusconi for staying the course in iraq and keeping italy 's 3,000 troops there despite widespread domestic opposition to the war and the abductions by insurgents of italian citizens , at least one of whom , a journalist , was killed . " in all of these difficult months , never once has prime minister berlusconi or -lrb- foreign minister -rrb- franco frattini or anyone in the italian government blinked , " he said .
" not once did they stand back and say maybe we better take another look .
not once . " they 've always been with us , " powell said , according to a transcript of the remarks released by the state department .
" we draw strength from the shared conviction that our two countries are part of a noble mission . " italy is the third-biggest contributor to the us-led coalition in iraq but deployed its troops to the southern part of the country only after the us and britain had completed the military overthrow of saddam hussein 's regime . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform tops schröder 's talks with indian leaders german chancellor schröder has praised close indo-german cooperation on un reform and mutual support for their bids for permanent security council seats during talks with indian premier singh in delhi .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .

but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .

in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .

a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .

the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .

the event is designed to raise european awareness of the continent 's largest , but much-maligned minority . hosted by the association of european cultural institutes in berlin -lrb- gek -rrb- , the two-week festival will be showcasing a culture that 's all too often marginalized - for a range of deeply-entrenched social , political and religious reasons . the organizers , though , are at pains not to concentrate on the historical and ongoing persecution the roma and sinti have suffered , choosing instead to profile the minorities ' evolving cultural identity in the light of the recent eu eastwards enlargement . it 's a cause with increasing support .
the plight of the gypsies is an issue livia jaroka , the first roma member of the european parliament , has been lobbying to have placed at the top of the brussels agenda since her appointment in may . changing the roma and sinti image being shown in a positive light will be a novelty for these beleagured minorities .
today , europe 's 12 million sinti and roma live primarily in the former eastern block , where the turbulent break-up of nations into ethnicity-based states led irrevocably to their isolation and often deprived them of their citizenship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin / tiergarten : romani rose , vorsitzender des zentralrates deutscher sinti und roma und helfer sammelten am sonabend bei strömendem regen unterschriften für den bau des nationalen holocaust-denkmals für die ermordeten sinti und roma .
damit solle deutlich gemacht werden , " dass es die sache der ganzen gesellschaft ist " , sagt rose .
als eine der ersten unterzeichnete renate künast , bundesvorsitzende der grünen , die liste .
vor der unterschriftenaktion hatten rund 150 prominente den appell unterzeichnet , darunter paul spiegel , chef des zentralrats der juden , alt-kanzler helmut schmidt und schriftsteller günter grass .

lesser-known victims of the nazi 's genocide programs , the roma and sinti issue recently became a topic of public debate in germany - home to some 70,000 of them - when activists called for a memorial to roma and sinti holocaust victims near berlin 's parliament building and the brandenburg gate . contemporary edge highlights of the festival include screenings of critically acclaimed films such as emir kusturica 's classic time of the gypsies and tony gadlif 's gadjo dilo ; exhibitions of work by artists including hungarian photographer david horváth , concerts by ensembles from slovakia , greece , the czech republic and poland , discussions and a reading by roma poet edward debicki from poland . " our aim is to present an authentic image of roma and sinti culture that proves it has a very lively tradition that 's not just about folklore , " agnes gelenscer from the hungarian culture institute , one of the organizers , told dw-world . " we want to illustrate that it has a contemporary dimension which is also visual , and not just music and dance-based , as the clichés suggest , " she pointed out . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering sinti and roma holocaust victims on the sixtieth anniversary of a sinti and roma revolt in auschwitz concentration camp , german president johannes rau on sunday said more should be done to keep the memory of these heroes alive . -lrb- may 16 , 2004 -rrb- roma mep urges commission to act for her people the first ever roma member of the european parliament has urged the european commission to start a concerted effort to improve living conditions for her people . -lrb- july 30 , 2004 -rrb- romania 's rocky path to respectability german chancellor gerhard schröder is visiting romania on thursday : the country is still struggling to meet criteria for eu accession . -lrb- august 12 , 2004 -rrb- feedback do you think europe needs to do more for its roma and sinti population ?

nevertheless , " compared with past periods of upturn , growth momentum remains weak , " they said . growth impulses were coming solely from abroad " and they have n't yet jumped over to the domestic demand , which has remained weak for an unusually long time , " the report said . it added that since the global upturn particularly in the united states and china is losing speed , the impulses for the german economy coming from exports can be expected to weaken . oil prices in particular constituted a " special risk " for the global economy , since they will put the brakes on private consumption , the institutes warned . the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce similarly predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year . based on the results of its regular survey of 25,000 companies , dihk said it was forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2005 , down from just under 2.0 percent this year . nevertheless , that was still an achievement in view of the fact that the german economy stagnated for three years until 2003 , dihk president martin wansleben noted . the economy " will continue to make progress in 2005 , albeit bit by bit , " he said . slowdown in exports in its october monthly report , published monday , germany 's bundesbank estimated that economic growth in germany has slowed in the third quarter of this year as exports - the main engine behind growth in the previous quarters - have hit a wall . " compared with the preceding quarter when growth reached 0.5 percent , the momentum is likely to have lessened somewhat , " the german central bank wrote . gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in germany expanded by 0.4 percent in the first three months of the current year and growth picked up fractionally to 0.5 percent in following three months . the anticipated slowdown in the third quarter was largely attributable to " somewhat calmer overseas demand " for german-made goods , the bundesbank said . " domestic demand has not been able to compensate for this , even if household spending has picked up somewhat compared with the spring , " the bank wrote . high oil prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in its monthly report , the bundesbank also warned that oil prices , one of the main culprits behind slowing global growth , could remain high for some time to come . " on the international oil markets , prices have shot up as far as 50 dollars per barrel in recent weeks , " the bank wrote .
" in fact , given continued strong international demand and restricted capacity reserves , the impression has arisen that oil prices will remain high for a long time . " on monday , oil prices shot up to a new record high of more than $ 55 -lrb- € 44.71 -rrb- per barrel . the bundesbank 's comments appear to differ from the official view of the european central bank which has so far said the rise in the price of oil has been exaggerated and will soon start to come down . indeed , a top ecb official said in a newspaper interview monday that the guardian of the euro was still confident that the conditions for recovery remained intact .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

his doctor at the max planck institute for psychiatry in munich said at the time that pressure to live up to expectations and the fight against injuries as well as private problems had taken their toll .
after publicly admitting to psychological problems in november 2003 , deisler underwent treatment before making a successful comeback .
deisler made a promising start to the season , winning a recall to the german squad , but performed less well in recent matches . dw-world.de bayern 's deisler leaves nerve clinic sebastian deisler , the young bayern munich playmaker who at one time carried the hopes of many german soccer fans , has checked out of the clinic where he was being treated for depression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.10.2004 a story of keeping pace and hopes alive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stuttgart keep on wolfsburg 's tail in the tight contest at the top the bundesliga returns to action with smaller group battles beginning to materialize within the league .
while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .

while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

" in fact , given continued strong international demand and restricted capacity reserves , the impression has arisen that oil prices will remain high for a long time . " on monday , oil prices shot up to a new record high of more than $ 55 -lrb- € 44.71 -rrb- per barrel . the bundesbank 's comments appear to differ from the official view of the european central bank which has so far said the rise in the price of oil has been exaggerated and will soon start to come down . indeed , a top ecb official said in a newspaper interview monday that the guardian of the euro was still confident that the conditions for recovery remained intact .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .
and that 's apparent to the clients . " medica mondiale contends that the clients , german soldiers included , are complicit in the abuse of minors because they are obviously aware of how young the girls are and the prison-like conditions they live in . peacekeeping troops complicit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo .
medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.10.2004 job requirement : non-smoker großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking : one more reason not to hire someone a series of anti-smoking measures have initiated a sea change in smoking attitudes in germany .
but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .

of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .

but much more work is to be done , and companies are starting to take matters into their own hands . in addition to the typical job application questions about previous work experience and education , managers at the laserline digital printing company have included another : smoker or non-smoker ?
if you are the former , then your chances at working for the berlin-based company are slim .
" a smoker needs to be very good in order to have a chance with us , " babett deuse , the company 's director told a local newspaper last week .
smokers miss more work , take more breaks and generally lose more money for the company as a result , according to laserline .
though the target of criticism by unions , the company 's policy could gain currency in a country that has become eager to rid itself of its smoker-friendly image recently .
in the past three years , the german government has ratcheted up the price of a pack of cigarettes , instituted anti-smoking advertising and passed a law that gave greater protection to nonsmokers in the workplace .
the measures have accompanied the beginnings of a sea change in german attitudes towards smoking , among the most benevolent in europe according to a recent study .
" it 's become cool at the moment , culturally , " to be against smoking , a spokeswoman for the government 's drug authority told dw-world .
harder to light up at work though germany is far from following other european countries in banning smoking in bars and restaurants , the country 's private sector has begun to implement anti-smoking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a no-smoking sign on a deutsche bahn door measures with surprising commitment .
a change in law two years ago that required companies to set up smoker 's zones walled off from the rest of the workplace was seen as an important move against the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke .
in germany , one in every three people smoke at the office , according to a recent study .
" i think we 've done a lot of good as far as -lrb- non-smoking measures -rrb- in the workplace , " michaela goecke , who headed the study for the german health association , told dw-world .
of germany 's two million companies , most of the 5,000 major ones have begun adhering to the new anti-smoking law , goecke said .
but smaller and mid-sized companies , which do n't have as high a profile and escape under the radar screen of health inspectors , still remain a problem .
" you need to give them a bit more time , " she said .
but the measures alone were not enough to change the opinion of the european network for smoking prevention -lrb- ensp -rrb- in mid-october .
in a survey of anti-smoking measures in 28 european countries , germany ranked in the bottom 10 .
the country got particularly poor marks in the public and workplace smoking category , one of six categories including price and advertising bans that the ensp used to judge countries .
challenge : changing smoking 's image the problem , said goecke , remains protection for non-smokers working in public buildings .
among the caveats in the new law is one that allows smokers working in public areas with a lot of traffic the right to light up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two men smoke in the oval bar in dublin , ireland smoking 's image , as well , has not suffered as much as it has in the uk and america in recent years .
the dangerous effects of second-hand smoke , long a topic of discussion in the us , remains in the background , despite the government 's best efforts to bring it to the fore in recent years .
as a result , many think germany is a long way from following ireland , norway , malta , and next year , sweden , in implementing smoking bans in bars and restaurants .
smoking is " still seen as a minor flaw here , " dieter pienkny , the spokesman for the berlin-brandenburg branch of the german trade union federation .
" and it 's too important a topic to be seen as such . "
unions are nevertheless against a policy such as the one in place at laserline .
smoking can not be lumped into the same category as previous arrests or amount of times fired when talking about whether to hire someone or not .
" it 's a form of discrimination , " pienkny said .
" you can talk about better protection for non-smokers at the office , but the question is not allowed beforehand . " andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european study rebukes germany on smoking a europe-wide study of anti-smoking policies due out tuesday will criticize germany 's weak efforts to curb the habit .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .
and that 's apparent to the clients . " medica mondiale contends that the clients , german soldiers included , are complicit in the abuse of minors because they are obviously aware of how young the girls are and the prison-like conditions they live in . peacekeeping troops complicit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo .
medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .
members of the german kfor troops based in pristina would confirm the charges under the condition of anonymity , she claimed . filip slavkovic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opposition criticizes foreign military assignments german opposition politicians have called on the government to formulate a clearer policy for foreign military deployments after a report criticized bundeswehr peacekeeping troops in kosovo .

while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .

his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .

the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .

while the top teams try to keep up with the pace setters , teams near the bottom fight for their futures . the bundesliga enters its eighth week the top three teams threatening to break away after a tense and close first few weeks .
leaders wolfsburg sit just one place above unbeaten stuttgart with the ominously approaching bayern munich four points off the top . the next three teams - champions werder bremen , mainz and bayer leverkusen - are all in sight of the pacesetters but can not afford to concede too many points if they want to remain in contention .
six points separate first from sixth at the crowded summit while those outside the top half dozen are nine points and more behind . wolfsburg , who play hannover on sunday , may be temporarily displaced as league leaders by the end of saturday if stuttgart continue their good start to the season with a home win over borussia dortmund .
matthias sammer 's team could claim top spot if they can capitalize on recent form , both their and their opponents .
sammer entertains his old charges at the gottlieb daimler stadium safe in the knowledge that his stuttgart team have yet to lose a game so far . unbeaten vfb face careless bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ewerthon prays that dortmund can hang onto a lead and win a match for once .
his old team , however , are having trouble holding onto leads and seem to have an aversion to winning games they have taken control over .
a succession of careless draws have attributed to dortmund 's disappointing ninth place .
a defeat on saturday , and subsequent wins by any number of teams below them , could prove disastrous .
dortmund are the equivalent of one win from bottom place . bayern munich could continue their steady climb to the top with a win over schalke 04 at the olympic stadium this weekend .
victory will give the bavarian giants 17 points , equal to stuttgart before the week eight games .
bayern 's bruising 2-1 defeat of bremen last week showed the team 's growing resolve to fight for the title , which could prove bad news for the delicately restored confidence of schalke . the gelsenkirchen royal blues were languishing in 15th place before beating bochum 3-2 at the weekend , a win that pushed them up to seventh .
but as their season has shown so far , schalke are capable of hitting just as many lows as highs .
they will have to be at their most composed against a bayern team gathering momentum . bayer put brakes on the slump bildunterschrift : any slip-up by bayern could be capitalized on by a relieved bayer leverkusen team which put the brakes on a slide last week that threatened to undo some exquisite work in the early exchanges of this bundesliga season .
although a 3-0 win over a stalling hamburg side seemingly unable to lift themselves from the basement was relatively routine , it was an important victory after successive defeats . leverkusen visit the capital to face a happier hertha berlin team which has climbed from the doldrums of 16th to eighth place after turning over kaiserslautern 2-0 in week seven . champions werder bremen face a tough game against mainz on saturday .
battered off the ball against bayern , bremen will have to find their resolve in time to face the challenge of the bundesliga virgins who have not only made a good start to their first top flight campaign but have shown that a top five spot fits very comfortably thank you very much . confident mainz take on bruised bremen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen were on the end of a physical defeat by bayern munich last week .
it does n't seem to matter to jürgen klopp 's team if its home or away , mainz are capable of getting a result anywhere and against anyone .
confidence is high and mainz may prove hard to handle for a bremen team eager to compose themselves after being slugged by an unspectacular but motivated bayern performance last week . freiburg , who were beaten by mainz in week seven , travel to nuremberg in a bid to stop an early season slide .
dropping four places after last week 's defeat , week three 's sixth position seems a beautiful dream for freiburg who now sit in 13th .
nuremberg , a place above their visitors in 12th , know all about the dizzy heights after gradually sliding down the league from second at the start of the season . it could have been worse had it not been for the generous nature of dortmund 's current form , handing the nuremburgers a draw when defeat at the westfalen stadium looked unavoidable .
a win could lift either up a notch or two but a defeat could send them stumbling further down the ladder . elevators look for change of direction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bochum fans are used to going up and down leagues but would like some stability this year .
another team that is experiencing the effects of such a close run competition this year is vfl bochum .
the so-called elevators may not be so used these days to the relegation-promotion habit which earned them their nickname but they are definitely going in the wrong direction after losing to local rivals schalke last week . bochum were fifth after three games and seemed to be steady around seventh place until a draw against freiburg and a drubbing by bremen knocked them out of the comfort zone .
now in 14th , two points off the bottom , bochum face hansa rostock , the current occupiers of the wooden spoon position , at home in week eight . rostock lost the clash of the bottom clubs last week against hannover , a result that lifted their conquerors to tenth while consigning hansa to their fourth game without a win .
bochum 's form before the 4-1 thrashing by the champions two weeks ago was solid and the ruhr side may be looking to get back on track at the expense of struggling rostock . toppmöller 's hamburgers risk grilling bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the way out of the drop-zone seems lost on toppmöller 's hsv .
hamburg are far from out of the relegation woods despite glimpses of hope streaming through the branches of the league 's upper echelons in recent weeks .
possible salvation came knocking with a win over schalke 04 in week six but the hamburgers were made mince-meat by leverkusen at the weekend and were sucked back down to second from last place . opponents arminia bielefeld , who enjoyed a major leap in the league with their 2-1 win over nuremburg in week six , slipped up against stuttgart last time out and slipped from eighth to 11th .
their inconsistent form may well offer hamburg another lifeline to escape the pull of self destruction but could consequently consign klaus toppmöller 's team to the depths again and leave the coach 's position untenable . relegation zone battles come thick and fast bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victories are becoming a distant memory for borussia mönchengladbach .
with the high-flying wolves taking on hannover on sunday , riding high after beating borussia mönchengladbach 2-1 to hang onto top spot last week , the last of week eight 's games features ' gladbach and kaiserslautern , another team to suffer against the wolves a week before . kaiserslautern looked to have been heading out of the danger zone but back-to-back defeats have left them in the final relegation spot with ' gladbach just above them , hovering over the bottom three with the same number of points as ' lautern but with better goal difference .
with both teams sharing such close proximity , anything less than a win would see them change places and risk making that third relegation place their very own . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern beats bremen , leverkusen ends winless streak bayern munich underlined their determination to wrestle the german crown back from werder bremen with a 2-1 victory over the champions at the weserstadion on saturday .

but now , non-government groups say the practice still continues unchanged . it 's been alleged numerous times that german soldiers in kosovo visit women forced into prostitution , some of whom are minors . monika hauser , head of the non-government group medica mondiale in cologne , told deutsche welle that ever since 1999 when the nato-led multinational kfor peacekeeping troops were deployed to kosovo , bordellos housing minors working as prostitutes have sprung up all over the balkans .
ever younger girls are offered there to the international soldiers stationed there , hauser added . abuse of girls apparent to all medica mondiale , which supports a facility for prostitutes in djakovica in southern kosovo , says all evidence points to the widespread sexual abuse of girls in the region . according to hauser , the stories of the girls who come to the gynecological clinic or the psychological consultations the clinic offers confirm medica mondiale 's charges against german soldiers .
the girls are often kidnapped or lured to the bordellos by false promises and are then locked up there under slave-like conditions , raped and abused . " we 're talking about bordellos where the women have grilled bars in front of their windows , " hauser said .
" they have absolutely no chance of escaping from there .
and that 's apparent to the clients . " medica mondiale contends that the clients , german soldiers included , are complicit in the abuse of minors because they are obviously aware of how young the girls are and the prison-like conditions they live in . peacekeeping troops complicit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo .
medica mondiale 's charges are confirmed by international human rights groups such as amnesty international and the un women 's organization , unifem . earlier this year , a report by amnesty international on the flesh trade in kosovo , concluded that the nato-led kfor troops as well as the un mission in kosovo were responsible for the sexual abuse of women .
the german arm of amnesty also bemoaned that german soldiers solicited the services of the girls forced into prostitution . monika hauser said she had heard of similar stories circulating in kosovo .
" a un police official once told me in pristina that german soldiers , in particular , visit the bordellos , " she said . however , the un administration in kosovo played down questions by deutsche welle on the issue .
in a statement , it said that cases of international soldiers visiting bordellos were rare .
it added that strict disciplinary measures had been taken against those few soldiers found guilty of visiting prostitutes .
the un administration however , refrained from detailing the nationalities or posts of the accused . false charges ? however , not everyone buys the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo schnittger , press spokesman at the german defense ministry in berlin said that though the accusations against german soldiers are n't new , exhaustive investigations by the ministry had proven that the charges were false . soldiers are simply forbidden to leave the military base during their free time , schnittger said .
" and during duty , soldiers have so much to do on account of their responsibilities and the security situation that they have no opportunity to go and hunt for these bordellos , " schnittger added . but , monika hauser still sticks to her conviction that german soldiers do visit minors forced into prostitution .

nevertheless , " compared with past periods of upturn , growth momentum remains weak , " they said . growth impulses were coming solely from abroad " and they have n't yet jumped over to the domestic demand , which has remained weak for an unusually long time , " the report said . it added that since the global upturn particularly in the united states and china is losing speed , the impulses for the german economy coming from exports can be expected to weaken . oil prices in particular constituted a " special risk " for the global economy , since they will put the brakes on private consumption , the institutes warned . the dihk federation of german chambers of commerce similarly predicted a sharp slowdown in growth next year . based on the results of its regular survey of 25,000 companies , dihk said it was forecasting growth of 1.5 percent in 2005 , down from just under 2.0 percent this year . nevertheless , that was still an achievement in view of the fact that the german economy stagnated for three years until 2003 , dihk president martin wansleben noted . the economy " will continue to make progress in 2005 , albeit bit by bit , " he said . slowdown in exports in its october monthly report , published monday , germany 's bundesbank estimated that economic growth in germany has slowed in the third quarter of this year as exports - the main engine behind growth in the previous quarters - have hit a wall . " compared with the preceding quarter when growth reached 0.5 percent , the momentum is likely to have lessened somewhat , " the german central bank wrote . gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- in germany expanded by 0.4 percent in the first three months of the current year and growth picked up fractionally to 0.5 percent in following three months . the anticipated slowdown in the third quarter was largely attributable to " somewhat calmer overseas demand " for german-made goods , the bundesbank said . " domestic demand has not been able to compensate for this , even if household spending has picked up somewhat compared with the spring , " the bank wrote . high oil prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in its monthly report , the bundesbank also warned that oil prices , one of the main culprits behind slowing global growth , could remain high for some time to come . " on the international oil markets , prices have shot up as far as 50 dollars per barrel in recent weeks , " the bank wrote .
" in fact , given continued strong international demand and restricted capacity reserves , the impression has arisen that oil prices will remain high for a long time . " on monday , oil prices shot up to a new record high of more than $ 55 -lrb- € 44.71 -rrb- per barrel . the bundesbank 's comments appear to differ from the official view of the european central bank which has so far said the rise in the price of oil has been exaggerated and will soon start to come down . indeed , a top ecb official said in a newspaper interview monday that the guardian of the euro was still confident that the conditions for recovery remained intact . " naturally , uncertainty has increased as a result of oil prices and of a few mixed economic signals , " ecb executive board member jose manuel gonzales-paramo told the german business daily handelsblatt . " but i do n't believe so far that we have to alter our forecasts , " he added .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

the plants also expressed solidarity with workers at the bochum factory of gm 's german unit opel who were striking for a sixth consecutive day . the opel workers in bochum , the plant which is expected to take the heaviest losses in gm 's proposed down-sizing in germany , were joined in their protests by employees at other general motors sites across europe . poland 's solidarity union declared tuesday a day of solidarity without any stoppages at the opel factory in gliwice . " there are solidarity flags in the factory , " an aide to slawomir ciebiera , the solidarity representative in the plant , told reporters .
" a banner proclaiming ' protest action ' has been hung over the administration building . " gliwice , in the south of poland , employs 2,000 workers who produce 40,000 opel astra ii cars a year . " we are distributing leaflets to the staff to inform them of the situation , " ciebiera said .
" we express our solidarity with the german workers and their families . " polish and spanish plants protest cuts " we protest against job cuts and attempts to set workers from different countries and plants against each other , " he added .
meetings in support were also due to be held at the spanish plant in zaragoza , even if no work stoppages as such were expected there . reinhard kuhlmann , the secretary general of the european metal workers federation , estimated that about 50,000 workers were taking part in the europe-wide protests . " about 50,000 gm workers in europe are participating in the day of protest and if you include family members and residents of the towns where the plants are located , then it may well be that as many as 110,000 will take part , " kuhlmann said . production at opel 's factory in bochum has been at a standstill since thursday when gm originally unveiled its plans for cut the workforce .
but kuhlmann said that not all of gm 's assembly lines in europe were expected to be hit by the stoppages . strikes begin to take effect on production bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : production was down , at least temporarily , on vectra models at opel 's main factory in rüsselsheim , near frankfurt , which employs a workforce of 20,000 .
officials there said the stoppage could last for around two hours . some 2,500 workers were similarly expected to lay down tools at the factory in kaiserslautern .
both plants were beginning to feel the effects of six-days of strikes in bochum where parts for the vectra model are produced .
workers at factories operated by general motors in britain , where 400 jobs are to be cut , were also set to down tools briefly . a spokesman for gm europe said that three 20-minute breaks were being planned at the group 's factory in antwerp so that workers could participate in so-called information rallies there . works council officials said if the stoppages at bochum were to continue for the next few days , then production in antwerp could be affected because bochum supplied the factory with axles , exhaust pipes , pressed body parts and power trains for opel 's astra cars .
bochum also supplies parts and components to ellesmere port in britain and gliwice in poland . government calls for further negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder .
as the labor conflict escalates , politicians called for calm .
in berlin on monday , chancellor gerhard schröder urged employees to enter into negotiations with management so that work could resume .
but both sides appear to be digging their heels in . a report in the daily die welt said that opel 's management was planning to sack without notice the organizers of the protests , which it terms wildcat strikes and are therefore illegal under german labor law .
strikes are only permissible in germany if they are directly called for by unions following an official strike ballot .
the gm europe spokesman rejected the report . trade union warns against revenge sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen peters .
nevertheless , the head of the powerful ig metall labor union jürgen peters warned opel against sacking the organizers of the protests , because that would only lead to a further escalation of the situation , he told german deutschlandfunk radio . " we have to find a solution .
people want to know what 's going to happen with them , " peters said . the solution must entail no plant closures and above all " security for employees , " he added .
" we have to talk about how such drastic restructuring can be implemented without forced redundancies . " in the meantime , opel management in rüsselsheim said it hoped to reach a " joint solution " with unions to safeguard the group 's german manufacturing facilities . both management and unions were seeking a " joint solution for making the rüsselsheim and bochum factories so competitive that they can be retained as car manufacturing plants beyond 2010 , " opel said in a statement . afp / dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de both sides dig in for long fight in opel stand-off managers and workers representatives at german car maker opel met on monday to resolve the bitter stand-off over proposed mass redundancies .

the current president is the best suited to protecting the united states and ensuring that terrorists do not threaten the democratic world , he said .
in an interview with dw-world , the neo-conservative foreign policy expert and staunch advocate of the us war on iraq said german chancellor gerhard schröder must change his position on iraq , no matter who sits in the white house after the november election .
" the case for german participation - i am not talking troops - but the case for germany making a serious contribution to the 25 million people of iraq in this moment of a great test between the forces of democracy and the forces of terror , that case is overwhelming and i can imagine why the chancellor might want to wait until after the election , " perle said in reference to john kerry 's statements that he would call on allies in europe to play an increased role in rebuilding and stabilizing iraq .
" no matter who wins , i think it is so much in germany 's interest to participate that i would hope that we will see german participation , " he said .
schröder 's kerry conundrum but in order for that to happen , schröder would have to completely reverse his position .
since the us invasion in iraq last year , the chancellor has made it very clear that he will not send german troops to iraq , even if there is a united nations mandate to do so .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck and german chancellor gerhard schröder only last week , schröder was emphatic : " there will be no change " in our policy , he said at a press conference in response to a question whether germany would contribute soldiers to a nato training mission in iraq .
but if john kerry wins the us presidential election and follows through with his pledge to involve the united nations and europe in the reconstruction of iraq , schröder could find himself under increased pressure to provide support of some sort .
does that mean the chancellor secretly hopes for bush 's reelection ?
richard perle says that 's not likely .
" i assume the chancellor is for john kerry .
but the issue is n't whether germany reverses its position and sends military forces to iraq .
the larger question is whether germany sits on the sidelines and chooses not to make any significant contribution to the outcome in iraq . "
success in iraq is crucial perle was adamant : what happens in iraq does not only effect the united states .
" iraq is so important for the world - and in particular what is vital for the world is a success in iraq .
an american defeat - which is n't unimaginable - would be such an encouragement to the terrorists around the world that i ca n't imagine why a country able to help prevent that would not join in doing so .
and there is a great deal that germany can do that does not involve sending troops . "
at the moment , germany is involved in training iraqi police and soldiers outside of the country .
it also plans to train hundreds of iraqi truck drivers , explosives experts and others in the united arab emirates and germany in the next two months .
berlin has also promised to write off 50 percent of iraqi debt and has pledged € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to iraqi reconstruction efforts as part of a larger european union financial package .
but providing more than that goes beyond what berlin is willing to commit at this point .
" any us administration must know that a request for the deployment of german soldiers in iraq would be senseless and would only drive a further wedge in the transatlantic relationship , " rainer arnold , the defense affairs spokesman for schröder 's social democrats , told reporters last week .

sir david king , who is also head of the uk office of science and technology , is visiting teesside university .
he is due to deliver the university 's annual science and technology lecture .
sir david has already said the world has to adapt to prepare for significant changes ahead .
he warns we must reduce greenhouse gases .
professor brian hobbs , dean of the school of science and technology at the university , said : " science and technology feature highly on our government 's agenda and the issue of climate change is of global significance .
' serious issue ' " we are extremely pleased that sir david has agreed to be our lecturer this year and we look forward to a stimulating and thought-provoking event . "
earlier this month , sir david told a conference in london that levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere already represent a danger .
he said climate change was " the most serious issue facing us this century and beyond " .
he added that on present trends the world was just 60 years from triggering an irreversible climate disaster .
if warming temperatures one day melted the greenland ice cap , he said , that would mean global sea levels would ultimately rise by 6-7m -lrb- 19-22ft -rrb- .

about 58 % of chartered surveyors in scotland reported price rises in the three months to september .
elizabeth bruce , of rics scotland , said the housing market was slowing in line with the rest of the economy .
the rest of the uk saw a second consecutive monthly fall in house prices , according to the study .

only two per cent of those surveyors in scotland said prices had fallen significantly over the past three months .
ms bruce said : " the housing market is slowing down with the economy , after consistent interest rate rises over the past year .
" the slowdown is desirable from the point of view of market sustainability and may mean that further rate rises are unnecessary for the time being .
" for buyers , a slower market offers the opportunity to take more time making such a major decision while fixed price properties can be attractive to a tight budget .
" sellers may have to accept that their property will take longer to sell and adjust their price expectations . "

the report by consultants scott wilson is to be considered on tuesday when new designs for the town 's cattle market scheme are unveiled .
andrew varley , of st edmundsbury borough council , said it confirms the project would help local traders in the suffolk town to prosper .
" without it , we would be set for a decline , " he said .

nick martin , town centre manager , says there should be a balance of shops in the area .
he said there are " great advantages " for both independent and large corporate retailers in improving the town 's attraction to shoppers .

mr martin added : " the group will need to be consistently on their guard to ensure that we protect the existing balance of shopping , which is such an outstanding feature of bury st edmunds . "
the planned development will open in 2007 and will feature a debenham 's store , hmv , waterstone 's bookshop and an outlet for the clothes chain h & m. critics say a lack of car parking space is a major problem for the project .

the lifts in the rocket tower have been out of order since the attraction opened in november 2001 .
up until now visitors have had to climb three sets of stairs to view the rockets from the top .
managers say it has taken so much time to get the lifts working because the original ones could not be repaired and a new set had to be installed .

photographs and underwear were going missing from debbie phillips ' south wales home , and she did not at first realise the father of her two children had stolen a house key .
she is one of an increasing number of people who fall victim to stalkers .
she spoke to bbc wales ' week in week out , which discovered that stalking is one of the uk 's fastest-growing crimes .
more than 2m people claim they have been victims in a 12-month period .
you do n't think anybody sane would be doing these things debbie phillips the programme investigates the problem and asks what more can be done to combat it .
the official government figure for stalking incidents for 2001 was more than double the number of burglaries in the same year .
and experts believe the real numbers could be much higher as many cases of stalking go unreported .
week in week out speaks to some of the victims , including ms phillips , who is shown watching cctv footage of her former partner breaking into her home in porth in rhondda , south wales after their relationship ended .
mark bradfield was filmed breaking into his ex-partner 's house " when you find out you just ca n't believe it , " she tells the programme .
" it sort of hits you , and you ca n't stop shaking because ... it 's like a horror film or a thriller .
you never thought in a million years it would happen to you .
" you do n't think anybody sane would be doing these things . "
ms phillips had feared for months that she was being watched by mark bradfield .
she changed the locks , but said photographs and underwear were going missing , and he seemed to know about almost every aspect of her personal life she filmed her ex-partner snooping around her home and reported him to the police .
mr bradfield was convicted in july on burglary , harassment and criminal damage charges .
" if i knew now what i should have known then , i would n't have done what i done , " mr bradfield tells the programme .
i did n't think i was harming them in any way by keeping an eye on proceedings stalker mark bradfield " i did n't think i was harming them in any way by keeping an eye on proceedings . "
according to the british crime survey , only around 30 % of those who said they were stalked told the police .
one of the uk 's leading anti-stalking experts is hamish brown , a former policeman with 30 years experience in the metropolitan police , who now advises on combatting harrassment .
he says more should be done to encourage victims to come forward and to detect the crime .
" there is still much more room to have more detailed training where people understand this very unusual part of law , " said mr brown .
" this part of law where people do things which are n't a criminal offence .
sending presents , hanging around outside someone 's house , that sort of thing .
psychiatric care " but it really wears someone down , and we 've seen in some tragic cases , some awful results , so there should be much more understanding of this very difficult and sensitive crime we know is staking " .
the programme also investigates the case of pregnant caroline evans who was shot dead in the west wales village of llangadog 20 months ago .
wil davies , a local farmer with no previous convictions , had stalked ms evans who was the landlady of the red lion pub , for months before killing her and himself .
davies was receiving psychiatric care having previously attacked the landlady , and a report into his treatment by the mental health services is expected next month from carmarthenshire local health board .
the board has already said there are lessons to be learned from the case .

lewes bonfire council said it was " particularly unsuitable " for children who could be frightened or get hurt .
thousands of people descend on lewes for the biggest bonfire event in sussex which sees local societies parade through the streets on 5 november .
non-residents are being discouraged from attending because of the lack of parking and crowded public transport .
' vulnerable to injury ' lewes bonfire council , which represents the town 's six bonfire societies , issued the warning supported by sussex police and lewes district council .
a sussex police spokeswoman said : " the event is a lewes tradition going back many years and allows the people of the town to celebrate the ancient tradition of bonfire .
" roads in the town are closed meaning there are no parking facilities .
" those using public transport are likely to find that it is very crowded and they may have to queue .
40,000 revellers " children in pushchairs and buggies are vulnerable to injury due to the density of the crowd .
" we know from many years ' experience that the larger the crowd the more uncomfortable it can become for spectators . "
