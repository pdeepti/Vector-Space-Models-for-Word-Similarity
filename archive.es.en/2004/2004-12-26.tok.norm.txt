over the next 10 years , experts say a record amount of money and assets is going to change hands in germany in the form of inheritance .
but becoming an heir or heiress is rarely hassle-free . all of € 200 billion -lrb- $ 267 billion -rrb- in cash and assets are due to be passed down to a new generation of german heirs through family inheritance .
granted , nearly a quarter of that sum will land in the laps of those who are already wealthy in their own right . but there will also be those for whom an inheritance is an unexpected windfall - if things run smoothly , that is .
because even when the allocation of the deceased 's assets has all been duly noted and authorized , inheriting still seems to bring a large share of in-fighting .
even more so when the deceased did n't specify exactly who gets what - a situation that routinely crops up in germany . according to surveys , around 70 percent of germans do n't have a will - something jan bittler , head of a german association focused on inheritance rights , attributes to a refusal to face up to the inevitable . " it 's often just the fear that comes with thinking about one 's own death , combined with the attitude that what happens after we die does n't concern us , as we wo n't be around anyway , " bittler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , german families tend not to discuss money matters when family elders are still alive .
once a parent dies though , arguments among siblings frequently flare up .
villas , expensive jewellery or bonds wo n't necessarily be at stake - the typical german inheritance looks quite different , according to bittler . emotional attachments " in most cases , what we 're talking about is the family home that took a long time to save for and a long time to pay off , plus a few other assets . " family members often end up fighting about objects that have sentimental rather than material value .
who gets grandma 's floral-patterned china that was a regular fixture at sunday dinners ?
who gets the living room clock that always ticked in such a reassuringly steady fashion ?
and who gets the piano that all the children always pounded on so gleefully ? other times , said bittler , it 's simply dividing up the assets that gives way to sour grapes . " if someone is given property worth € 200,000 , and someone else is given property worth € 400,000 , the question arises whether the person who got the higher value property has to even things out by paying back € 100,000 .
that 's the typical sort of situation that ends up before a court . " complicated family structures complicating matters even further is the fact that family structures are becoming more intricate in germany .
marriages often do n't last a lifetime anymore .
divorced couples start new families with new partners , and these new " patchwork families " are having a profound effect on the laws regulating inheritance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not forever anymore " you have to be careful that all of the children descended from the deceased get their share of the inheritance , " bittler said .
" that includes children from the first marriage and children from previous non-marital relationships .
they are all then included in the inheritance community with , for example , the second wife .
whether that makes much emotional sense is doubtful . " bittler advises those who want to spare their families this added grief to consider in good time how their possessions should be divided up - and not to wait until age 85 to do so . a will made in younger years could , for example , spare the 35-year-old widow an unpleasant fight with her in-laws over the house she shared with her husband .

over the next 10 years , experts say a record amount of money and assets is going to change hands in germany in the form of inheritance .
but becoming an heir or heiress is rarely hassle-free . all of € 200 billion -lrb- $ 267 billion -rrb- in cash and assets are due to be passed down to a new generation of german heirs through family inheritance .
granted , nearly a quarter of that sum will land in the laps of those who are already wealthy in their own right . but there will also be those for whom an inheritance is an unexpected windfall - if things run smoothly , that is .
because even when the allocation of the deceased 's assets has all been duly noted and authorized , inheriting still seems to bring a large share of in-fighting .
even more so when the deceased did n't specify exactly who gets what - a situation that routinely crops up in germany . according to surveys , around 70 percent of germans do n't have a will - something jan bittler , head of a german association focused on inheritance rights , attributes to a refusal to face up to the inevitable . " it 's often just the fear that comes with thinking about one 's own death , combined with the attitude that what happens after we die does n't concern us , as we wo n't be around anyway , " bittler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , german families tend not to discuss money matters when family elders are still alive .

over the next 10 years , experts say a record amount of money and assets is going to change hands in germany in the form of inheritance .
but becoming an heir or heiress is rarely hassle-free . all of € 200 billion -lrb- $ 267 billion -rrb- in cash and assets are due to be passed down to a new generation of german heirs through family inheritance .
granted , nearly a quarter of that sum will land in the laps of those who are already wealthy in their own right . but there will also be those for whom an inheritance is an unexpected windfall - if things run smoothly , that is .
because even when the allocation of the deceased 's assets has all been duly noted and authorized , inheriting still seems to bring a large share of in-fighting .
even more so when the deceased did n't specify exactly who gets what - a situation that routinely crops up in germany . according to surveys , around 70 percent of germans do n't have a will - something jan bittler , head of a german association focused on inheritance rights , attributes to a refusal to face up to the inevitable . " it 's often just the fear that comes with thinking about one 's own death , combined with the attitude that what happens after we die does n't concern us , as we wo n't be around anyway , " bittler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in addition , german families tend not to discuss money matters when family elders are still alive .
once a parent dies though , arguments among siblings frequently flare up .
villas , expensive jewellery or bonds wo n't necessarily be at stake - the typical german inheritance looks quite different , according to bittler . emotional attachments " in most cases , what we 're talking about is the family home that took a long time to save for and a long time to pay off , plus a few other assets . " family members often end up fighting about objects that have sentimental rather than material value .
who gets grandma 's floral-patterned china that was a regular fixture at sunday dinners ?
who gets the living room clock that always ticked in such a reassuringly steady fashion ?
and who gets the piano that all the children always pounded on so gleefully ? other times , said bittler , it 's simply dividing up the assets that gives way to sour grapes . " if someone is given property worth € 200,000 , and someone else is given property worth € 400,000 , the question arises whether the person who got the higher value property has to even things out by paying back € 100,000 .
that 's the typical sort of situation that ends up before a court . " complicated family structures complicating matters even further is the fact that family structures are becoming more intricate in germany .
marriages often do n't last a lifetime anymore .
divorced couples start new families with new partners , and these new " patchwork families " are having a profound effect on the laws regulating inheritance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not forever anymore " you have to be careful that all of the children descended from the deceased get their share of the inheritance , " bittler said .
" that includes children from the first marriage and children from previous non-marital relationships .
they are all then included in the inheritance community with , for example , the second wife .
whether that makes much emotional sense is doubtful . " bittler advises those who want to spare their families this added grief to consider in good time how their possessions should be divided up - and not to wait until age 85 to do so . a will made in younger years could , for example , spare the 35-year-old widow an unpleasant fight with her in-laws over the house she shared with her husband .

the bbc 's director general greg dyke left the corporation following the hutton report .
enter mark thompson , fresh from a stint at channel 4 , on a mission to make the bbc leaner and meaner as it geared up to apply for a new charter .
filling mark thompson 's seat at channel 4 was andy duncan , who had to wrestle with the question of just how his network would pay its way in a future full of competing channels .
a merger with five was considered - and thrown out .
while at itv , most of the network 's individual companies were finally joined together as one company .
as with the bbc , job cuts and political wrangling are on the cards as the new firm prepares for its digital future .
and in radio , commercial giants capital and gwr are gearing up to merge - creating a chain of 55 local stations , of the kind never seen before in the uk .
reality titans there were few clues to all of this on air , though - it was strictly business as usual .
kerry mcfadden was itv 's queen of the jungle in february 2004 critics still scoffed , but viewers still turned on in droves for reality tv titans i 'm a celebrity ...
get me out of here ! and big brother 5 .
kerry mcfadden and joe pasquale saw their celebrity stock rise in itv 's jungle , while big brother definitely packed a punch as a violent row broke out three weeks into the show 's run .
reality tv still has a hold on viewers - but producers are getting wary of overkill , despite five hitting the publicity jackpot with tabloid favourite rebecca loos , a pig , and the farm .
but big brother winner nadia almada 's plans for world domination stumbled when her debut single limped into the chart at number 27 , while ratings for joe pasquale 's i 'm a celebrity victory in december were down on kerry mcfadden 's triumph in february .
king of the soaps strictly come dancing revived bruce forsyth 's career coronation street came out as the undisputed king of the soaps thanks to a series of strong storylines , while eastenders faltered as viewers struggled to care about the slaters , the fowlers , and the ill-fated ferreiras , and sniggered at revelations of leslie grantham 's webcam antics in the sunday newspapers .
things got so bad that eastenders was crushed in the ratings when it went up against an extended emmerdale .
but the bbc hit saturday night gold in strictly come dancing , reviving both an age-old format and the career of bruce forsyth - three years after he walked out on itv , fearing he was being marginalised .
now it 's itv that 's inspired by forsyth 's show - with torvill and dean to front a celebrity ice dance show for itv , titled stars on thin ice .
but itv was pleased enough with talent show the x factor to commission a second series - despite simon fuller complaining that it was a straight copy of pop idol .
a different kind of real-life story attracted millions to bbc two - who do you think you are ? followed famous faces as they tracked down their family histories , and encouraged viewers to do the same .
sporting hits euro 2004 football and the olympics proved once again the pulling power of sport - although it was viewers in the middle east who heard ron atkinson 's fateful criticism of chelsea 's marcel desailly after a champions league game , which led to him resigning from itv in disgrace .
coronation street had an explosive 2004 sky one scored with reality football show the match , and followed it up by commissioning supernatural drama , hex , starring christina cole as a schoolgirl who discovers she has supernatural powers .
but there was enough action on the other digital channels to give sky one the spooks too - bbc three 's flashmob : the opera did n't quite live up to its billing , but the sight of football fans singing at each other in london 's paddington station was one of the year 's oddest .
but little britain cemented its status as bbc three 's biggest hit to date by transferring to bbc one - albeit with some of its edgier moments smoothed out .
itv launched itv3 , while shopping channel auctionworld went into administration following a £ 450,000 fine from ofcom .
super bowl row us tv saw the end of frasier - and life after friends as spin-off show joey made a successful start .
but it found itself in uncertain waters after janet jackson 's nipple exposure during the super bowl .
cbs was landed with a $ 550,000 fine - and its rivals were wary about incurring the wrath of the regulator .
howard stern plans to leave mainstream us radio shock jock pioneer howard stern 's reaction was to hand in his notice , announcing he was joining a satellite radio network which was free from the controls of the watchdog .
uk radio was stunned by john peel 's untimely death in october , after he suffered a heart attack in peru .
the range - and huge number - of tributes paid to one of bbc radio 1 's founders proved he would be remembered as more than just a patron of new music .
longtime bbc radio 2 stalwart john dunn also passed away , while blue peter presenter caron keating lost her seven-year battle with breast cancer .
the new year will see a new incarnation for top of the pops , moving to sundays bbc two after the failure of andi peters ' " all new ... " revamp of 2003 .
it will be tied into the announcement of the main top 40 singles chart - which itself will be revamped on radio 1 under rising stars jk & joel .
and while behind the scenes british broadcasting is in the throes of a tough time , those behind it will be hoping the strain will not show to viewers in a tough year ahead .

experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society .
the first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003 : the iowa game , commissioned by the democrat hopeful howard dean .
more than 20 followed suit , including frontrunner , elections , president forever and the political machine , which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign , including having to cope with the media .
others helped raise the stakes during the bush / kerry contest by highlighting a candidate 's virtues or his vices .
press-to-play politics the phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games , a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers . "
it 's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games " gonzalo frasca , university of copenhagen " when i started researching political games at the university , about five years ago , i thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen , " said gonzalo frasca , computer games specialist at the information technology university of copenhagen .
" i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved , " added the uruguayan-born researcher , who has so far created games for two political campaigns .
many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com.
the aim is to comment on international news events via games .
play to explore the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way .
" video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new , but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation , " mr frasca told the bbc news website .
this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay , cambiemos , an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country 's problems could be solved by working together .
" it 's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games . "
ultimately , dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes , fears and beliefs .
" children learn a lot about the world through play .
there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up . "
gaming know-how but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns .
this is hardly surprising , compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web .
only a few years ago , most politicians did not have a webpage , while now it is almost a must-have .
dr frasca said : " political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games .
they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them . "
" it will not replace other forms of political propaganda , but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns . "

" i must admit that i was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved , " added the uruguayan-born researcher , who has so far created games for two political campaigns .
many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com.
the aim is to comment on international news events via games .
play to explore the ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way .
games are no longer exclusive entertainment territory " video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new , but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation , " mr frasca told the bbc news website .
this was the case with the one he created for a political party in uruguay , cambiemos , an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country 's problems could be solved by working together .
" it 's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games . "
ultimately , dr frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes , fears and beliefs .
" children learn a lot about the world through play .
there is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up . "
gaming know-how but experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns .
games ' simulation skills have a big communication potential this is hardly surprising , compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web .
only a few years ago , most politicians did not have a webpage , while now it is almost a must-have .
dr frasca said : " political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games .
they represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them . "
" it will not replace other forms of political propaganda , but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns . "

then at about 1000 this morning our time a huge wave suddenly hit the beach .
we were still in bed in a ground floor room right on the beachfront when we suddenly heard some shouts from outside . "
we were swept along for a few hundred metres , trying to dodge the motorcycles , refrigerators , cars and other debris that were coming with us " then the water started coming under the door .
within a few seconds it was touching the window .
we very quickly scrambled to get out as the windows started to cave in and glass shattered everywhere .
we swam out of the room neck deep in water , forcing our way through the tables and chairs in the restaurant and up into a tree .
but within about 30 seconds that tree collapsed as well and we were thrust back into the water where we had to try and keep our heads above the water line .
we were swept along for a few hundred metres , trying to dodge the motorcycles , refrigerators , cars and other debris that were coming with us .
finally , about 300m inshore , we managed to get hold of a pillar , which we held onto until the waters just gradually began to subside .
little help other people though were n't so lucky .
one elderly british gentleman was walking around in a state of shock .
his wife had been swimming when the waves struck .
and a family has just walked past carrying a very small bundle with pale white feet poking out the bottom of it .
as they walked past , the teenage son , wearing an england football shirt said in a very matter of fact way " my brother is dead " .
looking around it 's easy to see that this has caused incredible devastation here .
there are cars in trees , buildings destroyed .
but it is impossible really to get an accurate picture of the number of casualties from where i am .
i have n't looked around a great deal yet , and i certainly have n't been inside the ruins of the hotel or other buildings , or joined in the digging .
but in one small area of one small village i have seen four bodies so far , including two sri lankans - an elderly lady and a young woman - and the western boy who looked to be about five years old .
there are no kind of emergency services here , there are no helicopters thumping through the sky to come to save people .
it is a do-it-yourself rescue .
people are trying to go through the buildings and rescue those who might be trapped . "
a call went round for a doctor ... but there are no doctors here " most people have gone up onto higher ground , fearful of another tidal wave - rumours are that another one might be coming and people are trying to get up onto the hills .
there are no real medical services here either at the moment .
a call went round about 15 minutes ago for a doctor because a man 's pulse was getting weaker and weaker but there are no doctors here .
i think the death toll is likely to rise quite sharply as rescuers start to arrive , and bodies begin to be dug out .

playwright gurpreet kaur bhattiat had death threats but a minister said people were entitled to protest .
rushdie told the sunday telegraph the government should be doing more to support freedom of expression .
he went into hiding in the 1980s after ayatollah khomeini of iran issued a fatwa for alleged blasphemy .
it seems that the blair government 's capacity to disappoint knows no bounds salman rushdie bhatti 's play , behzti , was closed after demonstrations against a rape scene in a sikh temple .
five police were injured in last week 's disturbance and three people were arrested .
bosses at the birmingham rep decided to abandon the three-week run of the show last week on safety grounds because faith leaders said they could not ensure there would not be a repeat of the violence .
rusdie told the sunday telegraph : " it has been horrifying to see the response .
it is pretty terrible to hear government ministers expressing approval of the ban and failing to condemn the violence , when they should be supporting freedom of expression " ..
home office minister fiona mactaggart told bbc radio 4 's today programme last week : " i think that when people are moved by theatre to protest , in a way that is a sign of the free speech which is so much a part of the british tradition " .
" i think that it is a great thing that people care enough about a performance to protest . "
rushdie said her comments sent the wrong message .
a fatwa forced rushdie into hiding " it should be quite clear that , in this country , it is the liberty of any artist to express their view of their own society and their own community .
" in 1989 , when the satanic verses was attacked , all political parties were united in their condemnation of the violence and their support for the principle of freedom of expression .
" it seems that the blair government 's capacity to disappoint knows no bounds . "
iran 's ruling cleric issued a death sentence against rushdie for his portrayal in his book of the prophet mohammed .
the author was forced into hiding and giving special protection by special branch , because of the fatwa .
ms kaur bhattiat is also said to be in hiding after the threats she received .
the national body of sikh organisations said in a statement it did not support any form of threat to the author .
" we unequivocally appeal to anyone who may have made these threats to withdraw them .
they have no endorsement from the sikh community , " said the statement .
