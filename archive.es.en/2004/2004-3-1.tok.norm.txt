in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .
on other hand , we do cooperate with lawyers , with detectives and also with the government to a certain extent to tighten loopholes in copyright and protect our logo .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .

if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .
they gave washington up to a year to change the fsc system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy in november last year , lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said , " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before counter-measures are to be applied in march 2004 . " u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .
" european business does not like sanctions because they hurt interests which have nothing to do with the disputes , " the business lobby unice wrote in a letter to lamy in february .
unice is also pushing lamy to consider giving a concession to the u.s. by allowing a phase-in period for the system to replace fsc . other lobby groups are also concerned .
" we do n't welcome it 's got this far but have to accept it , " claudia wörmann , foreign trade expert at germany 's bdi federation industry told reuters .
" the point is that these sanctions are completely in line with the wto ; the eu is acting logically from a wto point of view , but it 's a shame we have got into this situation .

voters in hamburg delivered a stinging defeat to chancellor schröder 's social democrats in sunday polls , reflecting discontentment with the party 's drive to trim welfare-state benefits as part of far-reaching reforms . the christian democratic incumbent mayor , ole von beust -lrb- photo -rrb- , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust. won an absolute majority in the elections , getting 46 percent of the vote .
schröder 's social democrats netted only 30.5 percent , the worst result for the party in a city they dominated until von beust 's 2001 victory .
" we now alone carry the responsibility for hamburg 's future , " an ebullient von beust told the bild newspaper .
the christian democrats clear victory marked the beginning of an active and , for schröder , long year in which five state elections and eight municipal elections will measure the popularity of the embattled spd .
" this is a clear signal for the election year , " cdu party boss angela merkel told reporters .
drawing encouragement from the hamburg election , merkel promised clearer ideas from the cdu in areas such as pension and tax reform .
greens bring hope , but not enough for spd not even a glowing result for the green party , who are in a national coalition with schröder 's spd , could rescue the hamburg social democrats .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .

when asked if germany would contribute troops to a stabilizing force in iraq , schröder told the abc news network 's " this week " program , " our resources are completely dedicated now to afghanistan and in the balkans , and therefore we are saying no . " " we also are saying no to that question because there 's no majority for that issue in the german parliament .

" if such a situation evolved , germany would not place any hurdles in the path of nato , " the chancellor told the newspaper .
" nevertheless , we would not be involved ourselves militarily . " schröder 's comments were being widely reported stateside as u.s. officials were praising the efforts of the governing council . " this is a major achievement , only a day late , which i think is terrific , " said u.s. secretary of state colin powell . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the deal as a " significant foundation stone , " according to a statement from a downing street spokesman . chancellor reiterates u.n. support despite the chancellor 's refusal to commit the bundeswehr to any peacekeeping duties , he did reaffirm german support for united nations involvement in transferring power within iraq . schröder told " this week " host george stephanopoulos that " the question simply is , how , and in what structure , should sovereignty be transferred to the iraqis themselves , and what role the united nations is going to play in this time .

in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .
on other hand , we do cooperate with lawyers , with detectives and also with the government to a certain extent to tighten loopholes in copyright and protect our logo .

voters in hamburg delivered a stinging defeat to chancellor schröder 's social democrats in sunday polls , reflecting discontentment with the party 's drive to trim welfare-state benefits as part of far-reaching reforms . the christian democratic incumbent mayor , ole von beust -lrb- photo -rrb- , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust. won an absolute majority in the elections , getting 46 percent of the vote .
schröder 's social democrats netted only 30.5 percent , the worst result for the party in a city they dominated until von beust 's 2001 victory .
" we now alone carry the responsibility for hamburg 's future , " an ebullient von beust told the bild newspaper .
the christian democrats clear victory marked the beginning of an active and , for schröder , long year in which five state elections and eight municipal elections will measure the popularity of the embattled spd .
" this is a clear signal for the election year , " cdu party boss angela merkel told reporters .
drawing encouragement from the hamburg election , merkel promised clearer ideas from the cdu in areas such as pension and tax reform .
greens bring hope , but not enough for spd not even a glowing result for the green party , who are in a national coalition with schröder 's spd , could rescue the hamburg social democrats .
the greens won 12.3 percent of the vote , almost four percent points more than in 2001 .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2004 hugo shows china who 's boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the well dressed in china have fallen for hugo boss and all the brand represents .
in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .
on other hand , we do cooperate with lawyers , with detectives and also with the government to a certain extent to tighten loopholes in copyright and protect our logo .

just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .

in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .
share values of consortium firms daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and siemens barely moved in reaction to the news , gaining around one percent on the german stock exchange , the dax . " when the first truck drives under one of the toll bridges and the coins start to rattle in the finance minister 's pockets , that 's when i 'll believe in the system .

voters in hamburg delivered a stinging defeat to chancellor schröder 's social democrats in sunday polls , reflecting discontentment with the party 's drive to trim welfare-state benefits as part of far-reaching reforms . the christian democratic incumbent mayor , ole von beust -lrb- photo -rrb- , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust. won an absolute majority in the elections , getting 46 percent of the vote .
schröder 's social democrats netted only 30.5 percent , the worst result for the party in a city they dominated until von beust 's 2001 victory .
" we now alone carry the responsibility for hamburg 's future , " an ebullient von beust told the bild newspaper .
the christian democrats clear victory marked the beginning of an active and , for schröder , long year in which five state elections and eight municipal elections will measure the popularity of the embattled spd .
" this is a clear signal for the election year , " cdu party boss angela merkel told reporters .
drawing encouragement from the hamburg election , merkel promised clearer ideas from the cdu in areas such as pension and tax reform .
greens bring hope , but not enough for spd not even a glowing result for the green party , who are in a national coalition with schröder 's spd , could rescue the hamburg social democrats .
the greens won 12.3 percent of the vote , almost four percent points more than in 2001 .
hamburg ’ s 1.2 million voters have not been immune to the rising unemployment in germany and the stagnating economic growth that have dogged schröder ’ s government since he first came to power in 1998 .
the city-state , which last year had germany ’ s highest per capita gross domestic product and gross wages , also has a jobless rate that rose from 8.3 percent in 2001 to 9.9 in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has a lot to think about .
the chancellor 's unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package , which seeks to downsize germany 's welfare system and job protection laws , has created additional waves of discontent in recent months .
" it ... is clear that we in national politics did n't give hamburg a strong tailwind , " said the soon-to-be secretary general of the spd , franz müntefering .
law-and-order party out of government another clear loser in the hamburg election was the party for a law-and-order offensive .
the party rode a wave of paranoia and law enforcement concerns to victory following the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 .
but party leader ronald schill left both the party and the government after allegations that he planned to expose a homosexual affair between von beust and a city official .
the party on sunday failed to reach the 5 percent hurdle for participation in government .
the infighting led to the collapse of von beust 's government in december and his decision to call early elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2004 eu imposes tariffs on u.s. in trade dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even toy trains from the u.s. face sanctions starting monday .
the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .
they gave washington up to a year to change the fsc system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy in november last year , lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said , " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before counter-measures are to be applied in march 2004 . " u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .
" european business does not like sanctions because they hurt interests which have nothing to do with the disputes , " the business lobby unice wrote in a letter to lamy in february .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .
they gave washington up to a year to change the fsc system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy in november last year , lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said , " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before counter-measures are to be applied in march 2004 . " u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2004 hugo shows china who 's boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the well dressed in china have fallen for hugo boss and all the brand represents .
in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .
on other hand , we do cooperate with lawyers , with detectives and also with the government to a certain extent to tighten loopholes in copyright and protect our logo .

in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2004 hugo shows china who 's boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the well dressed in china have fallen for hugo boss and all the brand represents .
in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .

voters in hamburg delivered a stinging defeat to chancellor schröder 's social democrats in sunday polls , reflecting discontentment with the party 's drive to trim welfare-state benefits as part of far-reaching reforms . the christian democratic incumbent mayor , ole von beust -lrb- photo -rrb- , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust. won an absolute majority in the elections , getting 46 percent of the vote .
schröder 's social democrats netted only 30.5 percent , the worst result for the party in a city they dominated until von beust 's 2001 victory .
" we now alone carry the responsibility for hamburg 's future , " an ebullient von beust told the bild newspaper .
the christian democrats clear victory marked the beginning of an active and , for schröder , long year in which five state elections and eight municipal elections will measure the popularity of the embattled spd .
" this is a clear signal for the election year , " cdu party boss angela merkel told reporters .
drawing encouragement from the hamburg election , merkel promised clearer ideas from the cdu in areas such as pension and tax reform .
greens bring hope , but not enough for spd not even a glowing result for the green party , who are in a national coalition with schröder 's spd , could rescue the hamburg social democrats .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .
share values of consortium firms daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and siemens barely moved in reaction to the news , gaining around one percent on the german stock exchange , the dax .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .
share values of consortium firms daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and siemens barely moved in reaction to the news , gaining around one percent on the german stock exchange , the dax . " when the first truck drives under one of the toll bridges and the coins start to rattle in the finance minister 's pockets , that 's when i 'll believe in the system .

voters in hamburg delivered a stinging defeat to chancellor schröder 's social democrats in sunday polls , reflecting discontentment with the party 's drive to trim welfare-state benefits as part of far-reaching reforms . the christian democratic incumbent mayor , ole von beust -lrb- photo -rrb- , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust. won an absolute majority in the elections , getting 46 percent of the vote .
schröder 's social democrats netted only 30.5 percent , the worst result for the party in a city they dominated until von beust 's 2001 victory .
" we now alone carry the responsibility for hamburg 's future , " an ebullient von beust told the bild newspaper .
the christian democrats clear victory marked the beginning of an active and , for schröder , long year in which five state elections and eight municipal elections will measure the popularity of the embattled spd .
" this is a clear signal for the election year , " cdu party boss angela merkel told reporters .
drawing encouragement from the hamburg election , merkel promised clearer ideas from the cdu in areas such as pension and tax reform .
greens bring hope , but not enough for spd not even a glowing result for the green party , who are in a national coalition with schröder 's spd , could rescue the hamburg social democrats .
the greens won 12.3 percent of the vote , almost four percent points more than in 2001 .
hamburg ’ s 1.2 million voters have not been immune to the rising unemployment in germany and the stagnating economic growth that have dogged schröder ’ s government since he first came to power in 1998 .

"
he said he did not see france and germany forging ahead if disagreement over the constitution continued .
" varying speeds of integration will appear from one state to the next , " fischer said and added , " we do n't want that and that 's why it can only be a transitional situation .
i believe the pressure will be so great that history itself will push matters in the right direction " .
fischer 's words are made all the more significant by the fact that in 2000 he gave a landmark speech at berlin 's humboldt university where he first spelt out the need for a two-speed europe .
the foreign minister said he had changed his views because of the consequences of september 11 , and the need for europe to politically shape globalization . www-links the latest eu-related news more briefs 01.03.2004 -pipe- berlin , paris set to face flak from brussels 27.02.2004 -pipe- russia may be offered more say in european security 27.02.2004 -pipe- u.s. firms to be hit by eu sanctions 27.02.2004 -pipe- european parliamentarians fail to reform pay system 26.02.2004 -pipe- eu commissioner warns against hasty euro adoption 26.02.2004 -pipe- enlargement to help eu catch u.s. on productivity 26.02.2004 -pipe- eu and u.s. near to galileo deal 25.02.2004 -pipe- czechs nominate second eu commissioner radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .
but even if that results in an autonomous government running iraq , german troops will not be part of any mission to keep the peace as the fledgling leadership begins the difficult task of reuniting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier in kabul .
when asked if germany would contribute troops to a stabilizing force in iraq , schröder told the abc news network 's " this week " program , " our resources are completely dedicated now to afghanistan and in the balkans , and therefore we are saying no .

" if such a situation evolved , germany would not place any hurdles in the path of nato , " the chancellor told the newspaper .
" nevertheless , we would not be involved ourselves militarily . " schröder 's comments were being widely reported stateside as u.s. officials were praising the efforts of the governing council .

" there are still no details as yet as to what form the government will take when the united states hands the power back to iraqis .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .

when asked if germany would contribute troops to a stabilizing force in iraq , schröder told the abc news network 's " this week " program , " our resources are completely dedicated now to afghanistan and in the balkans , and therefore we are saying no .

" nevertheless , we would not be involved ourselves militarily . " schröder 's comments were being widely reported stateside as u.s. officials were praising the efforts of the governing council .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .
they gave washington up to a year to change the fsc system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy in november last year , lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said , " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before counter-measures are to be applied in march 2004 . " u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .
" european business does not like sanctions because they hurt interests which have nothing to do with the disputes , " the business lobby unice wrote in a letter to lamy in february .
unice is also pushing lamy to consider giving a concession to the u.s. by allowing a phase-in period for the system to replace fsc . other lobby groups are also concerned .
" we do n't welcome it 's got this far but have to accept it , " claudia wörmann , foreign trade expert at germany 's bdi federation industry told reuters .
" the point is that these sanctions are completely in line with the wto ; the eu is acting logically from a wto point of view , but it 's a shame we have got into this situation .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .
they gave washington up to a year to change the fsc system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy in november last year , lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said , " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before counter-measures are to be applied in march 2004 . " u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .
" european business does not like sanctions because they hurt interests which have nothing to do with the disputes , " the business lobby unice wrote in a letter to lamy in february .
unice is also pushing lamy to consider giving a concession to the u.s. by allowing a phase-in period for the system to replace fsc . other lobby groups are also concerned .
" we do n't welcome it 's got this far but have to accept it , " claudia wörmann , foreign trade expert at germany 's bdi federation industry told reuters .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .

but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .

" u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .
" european business does not like sanctions because they hurt interests which have nothing to do with the disputes , " the business lobby unice wrote in a letter to lamy in february .
unice is also pushing lamy to consider giving a concession to the u.s. by allowing a phase-in period for the system to replace fsc . other lobby groups are also concerned .
" we do n't welcome it 's got this far but have to accept it , " claudia wörmann , foreign trade expert at germany 's bdi federation industry told reuters .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .
but even if that results in an autonomous government running iraq , german troops will not be part of any mission to keep the peace as the fledgling leadership begins the difficult task of reuniting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier in kabul .
when asked if germany would contribute troops to a stabilizing force in iraq , schröder told the abc news network 's " this week " program , " our resources are completely dedicated now to afghanistan and in the balkans , and therefore we are saying no . " " we also are saying no to that question because there 's no majority for that issue in the german parliament .
that has something to do with the past , and i think that we would be overstretching if we did that , " he added . germany would not block nato deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a separate interview in the washington post , schröder said germany would not send troops to iraq even as part of a nato-led force . " if such a situation evolved , germany would not place any hurdles in the path of nato , " the chancellor told the newspaper .
" nevertheless , we would not be involved ourselves militarily . " schröder 's comments were being widely reported stateside as u.s. officials were praising the efforts of the governing council . " this is a major achievement , only a day late , which i think is terrific , " said u.s. secretary of state colin powell . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the deal as a " significant foundation stone , " according to a statement from a downing street spokesman . chancellor reiterates u.n. support despite the chancellor 's refusal to commit the bundeswehr to any peacekeeping duties , he did reaffirm german support for united nations involvement in transferring power within iraq . schröder told " this week " host george stephanopoulos that " the question simply is , how , and in what structure , should sovereignty be transferred to the iraqis themselves , and what role the united nations is going to play in this time . " there are still no details as yet as to what form the government will take when the united states hands the power back to iraqis .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .
share values of consortium firms daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and siemens barely moved in reaction to the news , gaining around one percent on the german stock exchange , the dax .

in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.03.2004 belgium prepares to relive child murder trauma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a leaflet shows four girls murdered by dutroux .
belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

voters in hamburg delivered a stinging defeat to chancellor schröder 's social democrats in sunday polls , reflecting discontentment with the party 's drive to trim welfare-state benefits as part of far-reaching reforms . the christian democratic incumbent mayor , ole von beust -lrb- photo -rrb- , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ole von beust. won an absolute majority in the elections , getting 46 percent of the vote .
schröder 's social democrats netted only 30.5 percent , the worst result for the party in a city they dominated until von beust 's 2001 victory .
" we now alone carry the responsibility for hamburg 's future , " an ebullient von beust told the bild newspaper .
the christian democrats clear victory marked the beginning of an active and , for schröder , long year in which five state elections and eight municipal elections will measure the popularity of the embattled spd .
" this is a clear signal for the election year , " cdu party boss angela merkel told reporters .
drawing encouragement from the hamburg election , merkel promised clearer ideas from the cdu in areas such as pension and tax reform .
greens bring hope , but not enough for spd not even a glowing result for the green party , who are in a national coalition with schröder 's spd , could rescue the hamburg social democrats .
the greens won 12.3 percent of the vote , almost four percent points more than in 2001 .
hamburg ’ s 1.2 million voters have not been immune to the rising unemployment in germany and the stagnating economic growth that have dogged schröder ’ s government since he first came to power in 1998 .
the city-state , which last year had germany ’ s highest per capita gross domestic product and gross wages , also has a jobless rate that rose from 8.3 percent in 2001 to 9.9 in 2003 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has a lot to think about .
the chancellor 's unpopular " agenda 2010 " reform package , which seeks to downsize germany 's welfare system and job protection laws , has created additional waves of discontent in recent months .
" it ... is clear that we in national politics did n't give hamburg a strong tailwind , " said the soon-to-be secretary general of the spd , franz müntefering .
law-and-order party out of government another clear loser in the hamburg election was the party for a law-and-order offensive .
the party rode a wave of paranoia and law enforcement concerns to victory following the sept .
11 attacks in 2001 .
but party leader ronald schill left both the party and the government after allegations that he planned to expose a homosexual affair between von beust and a city official .
the party on sunday failed to reach the 5 percent hurdle for participation in government .
the infighting led to the collapse of von beust 's government in december and his decision to call early elections .
buoyed by the mayor 's enduring personal popularity , the cdu resolved to win an absolute majority in hamburg . on sunday , hamburg 's voters gave it to them . ´ dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg 's center-right coalition government collapses shaky ever since a cabinet minister allegedly threatened to out hamburg ’ s mayor as gay last august , the city state ’ s center-right coalition government collapsed on tuesday .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .

in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .

the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .
on other hand , we do cooperate with lawyers , with detectives and also with the government to a certain extent to tighten loopholes in copyright and protect our logo .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .

but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .

" u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .
" european business does not like sanctions because they hurt interests which have nothing to do with the disputes , " the business lobby unice wrote in a letter to lamy in february .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2004 hugo shows china who 's boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the well dressed in china have fallen for hugo boss and all the brand represents .
in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .
on other hand , we do cooperate with lawyers , with detectives and also with the government to a certain extent to tighten loopholes in copyright and protect our logo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2004 hugo shows china who 's boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the well dressed in china have fallen for hugo boss and all the brand represents .
in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .
on other hand , we do cooperate with lawyers , with detectives and also with the government to a certain extent to tighten loopholes in copyright and protect our logo .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .
but even if that results in an autonomous government running iraq , german troops will not be part of any mission to keep the peace as the fledgling leadership begins the difficult task of reuniting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier in kabul .
when asked if germany would contribute troops to a stabilizing force in iraq , schröder told the abc news network 's " this week " program , " our resources are completely dedicated now to afghanistan and in the balkans , and therefore we are saying no .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .
but even if that results in an autonomous government running iraq , german troops will not be part of any mission to keep the peace as the fledgling leadership begins the difficult task of reuniting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier in kabul .
when asked if germany would contribute troops to a stabilizing force in iraq , schröder told the abc news network 's " this week " program , " our resources are completely dedicated now to afghanistan and in the balkans , and therefore we are saying no . " " we also are saying no to that question because there 's no majority for that issue in the german parliament .
that has something to do with the past , and i think that we would be overstretching if we did that , " he added . germany would not block nato deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in a separate interview in the washington post , schröder said germany would not send troops to iraq even as part of a nato-led force . " if such a situation evolved , germany would not place any hurdles in the path of nato , " the chancellor told the newspaper .
" nevertheless , we would not be involved ourselves militarily . " schröder 's comments were being widely reported stateside as u.s. officials were praising the efforts of the governing council . " this is a major achievement , only a day late , which i think is terrific , " said u.s. secretary of state colin powell . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the deal as a " significant foundation stone , " according to a statement from a downing street spokesman . chancellor reiterates u.n. support despite the chancellor 's refusal to commit the bundeswehr to any peacekeeping duties , he did reaffirm german support for united nations involvement in transferring power within iraq . schröder told " this week " host george stephanopoulos that " the question simply is , how , and in what structure , should sovereignty be transferred to the iraqis themselves , and what role the united nations is going to play in this time . " there are still no details as yet as to what form the government will take when the united states hands the power back to iraqis .
a senior coalition official said discussions on the next phase of structuring the government would start " after a pause for breath . " differences despite recent success bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after a seemingly successful visit to washington last week , many expected news to soon break of renewed german-u.s. cooperation on iraq . while the leaders both admitted that they had " buried the hatchet " over their differences of opinion regarding the war , there may still be a distinct difference of opinion regarding the policing of the unstable country when the u.s. relinquishes power . the united states is still hoping to persuade the united nations to return to iraq to aid the transition process and for the international community to commit armed forces as part of a stabilizing force . germany , however , is staying with its position of having nothing militarily to do with a situation brought about by an invasion it opposed , despite gerhard schröder stating that he and president bush " have a common interest to see that iraq becomes stable and democratic .

chancellor schröder has dismissed talk of troop deployment in recent days as " wild speculations . "
-lrb- august 14 , 2003 -rrb- overburdened german army not likely to head to iraq after the u.s. senate decided to request nato help in postwar iraq , speculation is spreading in germany about a possible military deployment , despite concerns about the army ’ s overstretched capacities .

in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .
share values of consortium firms daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and siemens barely moved in reaction to the news , gaining around one percent on the german stock exchange , the dax . " when the first truck drives under one of the toll bridges and the coins start to rattle in the finance minister 's pockets , that 's when i 'll believe in the system .
but not before , " said stefan müller , a trader with the investment bank sal.oppenheim. dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .
they gave washington up to a year to change the fsc system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy in november last year , lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said , " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before counter-measures are to be applied in march 2004 . " u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .
" european business does not like sanctions because they hurt interests which have nothing to do with the disputes , " the business lobby unice wrote in a letter to lamy in february .
unice is also pushing lamy to consider giving a concession to the u.s. by allowing a phase-in period for the system to replace fsc . other lobby groups are also concerned .
" we do n't welcome it 's got this far but have to accept it , " claudia wörmann , foreign trade expert at germany 's bdi federation industry told reuters .
" the point is that these sanctions are completely in line with the wto ; the eu is acting logically from a wto point of view , but it 's a shame we have got into this situation .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .
they gave washington up to a year to change the fsc system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy in november last year , lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said , " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before counter-measures are to be applied in march 2004 . " u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .
" european business does not like sanctions because they hurt interests which have nothing to do with the disputes , " the business lobby unice wrote in a letter to lamy in february .
unice is also pushing lamy to consider giving a concession to the u.s. by allowing a phase-in period for the system to replace fsc . other lobby groups are also concerned .
" we do n't welcome it 's got this far but have to accept it , " claudia wörmann , foreign trade expert at germany 's bdi federation industry told reuters .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .
they gave washington up to a year to change the fsc system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy in november last year , lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said , " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before counter-measures are to be applied in march 2004 . " u.s. slow to act u.s. officials have also insisted that laws being considered in washington to dismantle the fsc system foresee a transition period .
several republican lawmakers as well as the bush administration have come up with ideas to replace the tax , but only foresee legislative action being taken in 2005 . the transition period has been rejected by the european commission , which demands the u.s. change the system of tax breaks immediately . no all-out transatlantic trade war eu officials are keen to stress that the slapping down of sanctions does n't amount to a new transatlantic trade row .
they point out that the current $ 200 million of sanctions on u.s. goods is just a mere fraction of the original $ 4 billion worth of goods the eu could have hit with duties . europe 's powerful lobby organizations are believed to be behind the eu 's cautious stance on sanctions on u.s. goods .
" european business does not like sanctions because they hurt interests which have nothing to do with the disputes , " the business lobby unice wrote in a letter to lamy in february .
unice is also pushing lamy to consider giving a concession to the u.s. by allowing a phase-in period for the system to replace fsc . other lobby groups are also concerned .

the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms . eu trade commissioner pascal lamy has decided to apply gradual pressure in what is being billed as a trade war with the united states , starting with a five percent duty on selected u.s. exports .
he said the rates would continue to rise unless the united states changed its law .
if no changes are made , the duty will reach 17 percent by march 2005 . " the eu 's objective remains the withdrawal of the u.s. illegal subsidy , " the european commission said in a statement .
" the eu has opted for a response which is measured , gradual , and geared towards focussing the minds of the u.s. legislators to comply . " the tariffs apply to a wide range of goods , including textiles , jewellery and toys , and could cost american exporters $ 300 million this year . u.s. export tax break system the sticking point at the heart of the dispute - which has been simmering for years - lies washington 's so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme which can bring u.s. companies tax breaks up to 30 percent .
the fsc system has benefited major companies including microsoft . the eu contends that the fsc system amounts to hidden government subsidies because it allows american-based companies to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of european competitors . the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- weighed in on the row and ruled in favor of the eu .
the wto originally gave the united states until nov .
2000 to withdraw its fsc scheme .
but with the united states slow to respond , the wto last may gave the eu the go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion . brussels adopts measured line but brussels opted to exercise restraint in the face of concerned european industry groups , fearing that an all-out transatlantic trade war would hurt business interests .
they gave washington up to a year to change the fsc system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for trade pascal lamy in november last year , lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- said , " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before counter-measures are to be applied in march 2004 .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .
share values of consortium firms daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and siemens barely moved in reaction to the news , gaining around one percent on the german stock exchange , the dax . " when the first truck drives under one of the toll bridges and the coins start to rattle in the finance minister 's pockets , that 's when i 'll believe in the system .
but not before , " said stefan müller , a trader with the investment bank sal.oppenheim. dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2004 hugo shows china who 's boss großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the well dressed in china have fallen for hugo boss and all the brand represents .
in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .
on other hand , we do cooperate with lawyers , with detectives and also with the government to a certain extent to tighten loopholes in copyright and protect our logo .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .

the iraqi governing council agreed on an interim constitution on monday which could pave the way to a return of sovereignty .
meanwhile , gerhard schröder again ruled out any german involvement in peacekeeping in iraq . as iraq 's governing council put aside differences on monday to forge an interim constitution , a series of interviews was aired across the united states in which german chancellor gerhard schröder ruled out sending german peacekeeping troops to iraq once a new iraqi government is installed . the first steps to the formation of an interim constitution were taken in the early hours of monday morning when the 25-member council ended hours of heated debate to eventually strike a deal . although it was 24 hours after a deadline to do so had passed , the council put aside divisions over the role of islam , quotas for women in government and kurdish demands for autonomy .
the document will be officially signed on wednesday . german troops will not police iraq , says schröder if the process continues , the constitution will form a key foundation in washington 's plans to hand sovereignty back to iraqis by june 30 .
but even if that results in an autonomous government running iraq , german troops will not be part of any mission to keep the peace as the fledgling leadership begins the difficult task of reuniting the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier in kabul .
when asked if germany would contribute troops to a stabilizing force in iraq , schröder told the abc news network 's " this week " program , " our resources are completely dedicated now to afghanistan and in the balkans , and therefore we are saying no . " " we also are saying no to that question because there 's no majority for that issue in the german parliament .

" if such a situation evolved , germany would not place any hurdles in the path of nato , " the chancellor told the newspaper .
" nevertheless , we would not be involved ourselves militarily . " schröder 's comments were being widely reported stateside as u.s. officials were praising the efforts of the governing council . " this is a major achievement , only a day late , which i think is terrific , " said u.s. secretary of state colin powell . british prime minister tony blair welcomed the deal as a " significant foundation stone , " according to a statement from a downing street spokesman . chancellor reiterates u.n. support despite the chancellor 's refusal to commit the bundeswehr to any peacekeeping duties , he did reaffirm german support for united nations involvement in transferring power within iraq . schröder told " this week " host george stephanopoulos that " the question simply is , how , and in what structure , should sovereignty be transferred to the iraqis themselves , and what role the united nations is going to play in this time . " there are still no details as yet as to what form the government will take when the united states hands the power back to iraqis .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .
share values of consortium firms daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and siemens barely moved in reaction to the news , gaining around one percent on the german stock exchange , the dax .

germany 's ill-fated satellite-based truck toll system has gained a new lease on life .
following negotiations on sunday , the government announced the high-tech project will go ahead , but with significant changes . emerging from sunday 's breakthrough negotiations , german chancellor gerhard schröder called the new deal a " balanced compromise . " two weeks ago , the government backed out of its contract with the consortium of companies , including german-u.s. auto giant daimlerchrysler and german telecommunications heavyweight deutsche telekom following months of incessant technical hitches and delays .
but now , the project is back on track after the consortium agreed to key concessions on questions of liability and penalties for breach of contract . schröder stressed he had n't lost faith in the high-tech , satellite-supported toll system despite an embarrassing and costly series of delays to its launch , which was initially supposed to take place in mid-2003 .
" we want to - and we will - demonstrate to germany , europe , and beyond , that germany is a center of innovation capable of successfully implementing this system , " schröder said . changes at the top the new , improved toll collect venture sees deutsche telekom absolving daimlerchrysler of the leading role in the project .
the consortium now includes another giant of german industry , siemens , which has taken on responsibility for technical coordination of the on-board units which are installed in the trucks . also central to the new agreement are changes increasing the consortium 's liability in case of breach of contract .
the companies have guaranteed that a scaled-down version of the system will be operational by jan.1 , 2005 to begin collecting tolls .
failure to comply could result in a fine of up to € 780 million -lrb- $ 975 million -rrb- .
as of jan.1 , 2006 , the companies face unlimited liability . an arbitration court is to settle the issue of revenue losses estimated at € 3 billion already incurred by the government because of delays to the start of the system . " it seems as if daimler 's being taken out of the crossfire as they 've moved into the background behind telekom and siemens , " a frankfurt analyst told reuters on condition of anonymity .
" in arbitration court , i expect the government to go easy on the consortium .
politically , they ca n't afford to kick their partners too hard in the shin . " market analysts remain sceptical despite the government 's assurances that , this time , toll collect will deliver , investors do n't appear to see the new agreement as a guarantee of the project 's success .
share values of consortium firms daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and siemens barely moved in reaction to the news , gaining around one percent on the german stock exchange , the dax . " when the first truck drives under one of the toll bridges and the coins start to rattle in the finance minister 's pockets , that 's when i 'll believe in the system .
but not before , " said stefan müller , a trader with the investment bank sal.oppenheim. dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is " made in germany " losing its luster ?
after several high-profile , high-tech mishaps , unease is growing in germany that the country 's reputation as a technological powerhouse has been hurt .
some wonder if german industry has lost its touch .

in china 's increasingly affluent upper classes , the name to have on business suits and casual wear is hugo boss , the german fashion label .
even those who ca n't afford the real thing love to wear the logo . the chinese have long had a taste for german cars .
just as those who are native to the country which produces mercedes , bmw , audi and opel , the chinese have taken to their hearts the curves , the reliability and the performance of germany 's automotive products .
now it seems that another icon of german style has made an impact in the orient : fashion label hugo boss . chinese popular fashion has a reputation for being a hip mix of retro styling ; thrift shop couture and market stall bargains .
that may well be true for the youth of the people 's republic who have embraced western casual clothing trends but for those who shop at the higher end , there is none more attractive that upscale swabian brand . as they pass down shopping streets littered with swatch outlets and haagen-dazs ice cream parlors , china 's new affluent classes are often decked out in the latest offerings from the german fashion house . new upper-class adopts boss style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's film stars honor the berlinale in german suits .
it is a scene increasingly common in a section of china 's society in which increasingly fashion conscious and well-paid chinese are helping the german brand become a market leader . " china is a booming market for us , " said phillip wolff , marketing manager in the hugo boss headquarters in the southern german town of metzingen .
" there exists a huge desire to catch up in terms of style .
and the people there love our product .
we can imagine that we will have a lot of success in china in the long term . " chinese success driving hugo profits up last year was a high point for boss marketing in the far east , one of the most difficult markets to break and remain successful in .
the company 's profits rose about ten percent to € 82.4 million -lrb- $ 102.5 million -rrb- with flourishing business in china contributing largely to the healthy figures .
boss expects to more than double sales in china over the next four to five years , according to a recent report in the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper . boss opened its first store in the most western chinese metropolis of shanghai in 1994 .
in the ten years since , boss has expanded to 50 stores across the people 's republic with another 50 estimated to open in the next five years . " this is a combination of the good product , of the price-quality relation and an excellent image around the world " , explains boss marketing head wolff , explaining the secret of boss ' success . a bringer of good luck bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another factor could be that the name .
" boss " itself conjures up good omens for the chinese , an association with a leader and chief that the superstitious believe can also bring luck .
such is the belief in the product and the brand name that well-off chinese dig deep into their pockets to buy goods which phillip wolff says are twice as expensive as they are in germany . goods from abroad are subject to high import taxes in china and foreign companies have to pay extra fees to access the chinese market .
as a result , boss clothing can swallow up a good few months worth of salary for the average chinese breadwinner .
those not yet a part of china 's nouveau well-to-do can still be clothed in hugo boss , in a way , although in the form of fake items from canny label forgers . roaring trade in counterfeit clothing there is a booming business in china 's bigger cities for fake boss items and specially made items on markets where a " hugo boss " label can be added at a bargain price . far from being concerned at the trade in fake boss clothing , the reaction from metzingen is a composed , even flattered , one .
" we would be offended if one did not fake us , " says wolff . " it is a good sign .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon on monday when accused pedophile marc dutroux appears in court , some seven years after the crimes that horrified the country . it was a case that traumatized an entire country .
while belgium is not immune to serious crime , the police investigation into the kidnapping and raping of six girls and the murder of four of them , shocked the nation to its core .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marc dutroux when self-confessed killer and child rapist marc dutroux -lrb- photo -rrb- was apprehended for the crimes , the whole of belgium knew that things would get a lot worse before any closure and justice could be found .
the harrowing details of the case will begin to emerge from monday when belgium 's biggest trial in living memory opens in the southeastern town of arlon , some seven years after the crimes of which dutroux is accused .
theories of protection likely to resurface while the evidence will bring back hideous memories for those involved and stir disgust and hatred across the country once more , the case is likely to re-ignite the flames of rumor that dutroux , who will appear with three co-defendants during the trial , was sheltered and offered high-level protection , a reason expressed by some as to why it took so long to track him down .
however , a recent poll carried out in belgium shows that almost nine in 10 of the nation 's citizens doubted that the truth would emerge from the proceedings , such is the belief that a wider conspiracy was at work .
a skeptical population is not convinced that a network of pedophiles suspected of involvement in the abduction of the girls was composed of just the four accused , dutroux and his three co-defendants - his wife , michelle martin , a drifter , michel lelièvre , and michel nihoul , a police informant .
protests brought down the government at the time , the public was enraged and disgusted .
the resulting protests and spiraling hysteria threw up many theories , including a popular belief that the pedophile ring that dutroux was allegedly part of included high-ranking officials and politicians .
the case provoked such public outrage that it contributed to the defeat of former prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's government in 1999 .
some 300,000 people joined the victims ' parents in one of the biggest demonstrations in the country 's history , known as the " white march " after the white clothes and balloons of the protesters .
dutroux 's defense team are likely to present the accused as members of a wider organization in a bid to deflect the severity of the charges away from single individuals .
the defense will try to convince the jury that dutroux did not kidnap the girls for himself .
the prosecuting counsel say they have no such evidence and have said they will ignore the theory of a sex ring , since a separate probe has yet to prove it existed .
dutroux is expected to plead guilty on some counts but he denies kidnapping the two eight-year-olds and murdering any girl .
xavier magnee , one of dutroux 's lawyers , does not expect the accused to get a fair trial , saying his client has already been judged by society given the amount of publicity his crimes have received .
" finding a jury that does not already have an opinion is obviously impossible , " he told reporters .
" if i plead poorly , he will get life .
if i plead well , he will get life . "
official bungling enraged citizens belgians were not only revolted by the crimes themselves but also by the police and judiciary incompetence during the search for the girls , some of whom had been missing for a year .
police admitted having had dutroux , a convicted child rapist , under surveillance , but never told those involved in the search for the girls .
they had searched his house and heard the girls ' cries but failed to find the false door that hid the tiny cells .
parliamentary inquiries later revealed that rivalries within the police force and justice system had split the investigation into parallel probes , none of which was sharing information .
horrible facts beyond doubt despite the conspiracy theories and garbled messages from both justice and police sources , some events are without doubt .
dutroux 's arrest in august 1996 was followed by the discovery of two victims - 12-year-old sabine dardenne and 14-year-old laetitia delhez - cowering naked in a makeshift cell below one of his homes , near the city of charleroi .
dutroux later showed police where the bodies of four more girls and a suspected accomplice were buried in the back yards of two other houses .
two of the victims , 8-year-olds julie lejeune and melissa russo , had died of starvation , apparently while dutroux was being held in custody on an unrelated charge . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : child-porn ring busted police have lashed out against pedophiles .

is it the last bastion of male domination in films ?
modern hollywood has belatedly taken a step in the right direction for equality .
coppola , who won an oscar for best original screenplay , takes her place on a select list featuring jane campion - nominated in 1994 for the piano - and italian director lina wertmuller .
wertmuller was the first female director nominated - for pasaqualino settebelleze -lrb- seven beauties -rrb- - in 1977 .
her controversial tale of a neapolitan man seeking to protect his sisters from a life of prostitution received critical acclaim - but wertmuller lost out on the academy award for directing to rocky director john g alvidsen .
directing decline and although dutch director marlene gorris won for an oscar in 1996 for her film antonia 's line , it was for best foreign language film rather than in the directors ' category .
coppola 's nomination raises the question of why women film directors remain such a rarity in hollywood , even in the 21st century .
the celluloid ceiling - a report issued by san diego state university last year - estimated that out of the top 250 grossing films of 2002 , men directed nine of the top 10 .
furthermore , the number of women working as directors , producers , writers , cinematographers or editors fell from 19 % in 2001 to 17 % during 2002 , the study reported .
in the uk the situation is even worse .
in 2002 , of the 350 films made in britain , only eight were made by women .
jane cussons , the director of the london-based group women in film and television , said she was " absolutely thrilled " at the news coppola had a nomination but added it underlined the bias that women still faced in this part of the industry .
her organisation has set up the directing change programme , launched last year , to try and give young female film-makers a break .
high-profile hollywood films were still almost impossible for women directors to get , with a similar situation in the uk - despite the success of bend it like beckham 's director gurinder chadha .
risky business " i wish they were making huge films with major hollywood talent , but they are n't , " said ms cussons .
" the reason we made this directing change programme last year was because the figures from the us and here were so bad . "
ms cussons said she was aware film-making was a risk - and investors often wanted a guarantee in the shape of a known director .
women directors were still not seen to be enough of a guarantee .
but also part of the problem was the traditional " gender imbalance " in the film industry , with men continuing to dominate technical trades like editing , sounding and cinematography .
even women 's high profile in film production , ms cussons said , came from a tradition " producers had a secretary , and she was a girl , and the directors had a secretary , and she was a girl " .
ms cussons said she had heard a recent story of a top female producer and a female director in cannes trying to finance their film who were asked at meetings where the director was - because financiers could not believe a woman would be directing .
" there are some really promising young directors at the moment , like emily young -lrb- kiss of life -rrb- and sarah gavron -lrb- this little life -rrb- .
we hope that in five or 10 years ' time we might well see a few more .
poor old gurinder ca n't make them all . "
ms cussons said she hoped coppola 's success also showed how a film like lost in translation needed its female viewpoint .
" women do have a point of view .
the film is quirky and original , and it could n't have been made by a man . "

is it the last bastion of male domination in films ?
modern hollywood has belatedly taken a step in the right direction for equality .
coppola , who won an oscar for best original screenplay , takes her place on a select list featuring jane campion - nominated in 1994 for the piano - and italian director lina wertmuller .
wertmuller was the first female director nominated - for pasaqualino settebelleze -lrb- seven beauties -rrb- - in 1977 .
her controversial tale of a neapolitan man seeking to protect his sisters from a life of prostitution received critical acclaim - but wertmuller lost out on the academy award for directing to rocky director john g alvidsen .
directing decline and although dutch director marlene gorris won for an oscar in 1996 for her film antonia 's line , it was for best foreign language film rather than in the directors ' category .
coppola 's nomination raises the question of why women film directors remain such a rarity in hollywood , even in the 21st century .
the celluloid ceiling - a report issued by san diego state university last year - estimated that out of the top 250 grossing films of 2002 , men directed nine of the top 10 .
ms cussons said a male director would not have made lost in translation furthermore , the number of women working as directors , producers , writers , cinematographers or editors fell from 19 % in 2001 to 17 % during 2002 , the study reported .
in the uk the situation is even worse .
in 2002 , of the 350 films made in britain , only eight were made by women .
jane cussons , the director of the london-based group women in film and television , said she was " absolutely thrilled " at the news coppola had a nomination but added it underlined the bias that women still faced in this part of the industry .
her organisation has set up the directing change programme , launched last year , to try and give young female film-makers a break .
high-profile hollywood films were still almost impossible for women directors to get , with a similar situation in the uk - despite the success of bend it like beckham 's director gurinder chadha .
risky business " i wish they were making huge films with major hollywood talent , but they are n't , " said ms cussons .

they are also more inclined to turn to alcohol than men in similar grades , according to researchers at university college london .
it is thought the stress of trying to compete with men for executive roles is partly to blame .
the findings are published in the journal occupational environmental medicine .
about 8,000 government employees took part in the survey of men and women working at different levels in 20 departments in london .
the prevalence of problem drinking among the men was roughly the same -lrb- between 10 and 12 % -rrb- from clerical right through to senior executive grades .
but the picture was very different for women , who made up a third of the survey sample .
women at lower grades were less likely to be problem drinkers than men in comparable grades , but they caught up with men , overtaking them at senior grades .
it may be that women feel they have to compete on an equal footing and take on male roles and behaviours jenny head senior female executives were more than three times as likely to be problem drinkers -lrb- 14 % -rrb- as those working in the lowest clerical grades -lrb- 4 % -rrb- .
the employees were asked about the demands of their job , their levels of support at work and at home and the degree to which they could make and influence decisions .
they were also measured on a points basis for the amount of effort they made and the rewards they received in terms of promotional prospects , pay , and the sense of feeling valued .
glass ceiling the object of the research was to look at whether work stress was linked to alcohol dependence , said senior lecturer in epidemiology and public health at university college london jenny head , who led the research .
" it may be the stress for women of working against a glass ceiling is to blame , " she said .
" it may be that women feel they have to compete on an equal footing and take on male roles and behaviours .
" people who find they put in effort and do n't feel they are getting rewards are more at risk of becoming a problem drinker . "
" we have already shown that stressful conditions at work can lead to poorer health for people .
" this is just another way that stress can impact on health . "
" they are also turning to alcohol because they feel they are not being adequately rewarded for their efforts . "
drinking culture alcohol concern has revealed that the survey reinforces previous studies , which have shown that women at senior levels are drinking more .
the charity 's spokeswoman anne jenkins said : " we have to ask whether women are drinking more because they feel under pressure .
" but we have to ask what is the drinking culture in this organisation at upper levels .
" do they feel more stressed , or is it that they are drinking to keep up with their peers ? "
ms head is reluctant to suggest the findings reflect a general trend , but because this is an ongoing study , it is an issue they plan to investigate further in the future .
your comments i 'm a physicist and consequently work in a male-dominated profession , but ca n't say this bothers me , and i certainly do n't feel obliged to become ' one of the lads ' to succeed .
whilst i think high-flying women may turn to alcohol because they are frustrated by blatant discrimination -lrb- i.e. being paid less for the same work -rrb- , i think a lot of the stress comes the expectation that women working full-time should be domestic goddesses as well ... can someone tell me where we 're meant to find the time to cook , clean , iron and make our own curtains ? !
heather , uk no indication in this story on the proportion of the senior executives who were unmarried / not living with a partner .
i suspect that amongst the women the percentage was much higher - and that there is a correlation between being a singleton and drinking .
it 's so much easier at the end of a 12-hour work day to get home and have a drink or two - or even three , rather than get yourself something to eat .
sue , uk the statistics do not surprise me lesley newton , uk as a professional woman who does drink too much to relieve stress , and has many friends in the same position , i can only say that the statistics do not surprise me .
however the reader 's comments that we should ' walk in her shoes ' as a mother of three working full time puzzles me .
no one had to have children if they do n't want to in this day - life is all about choices , and having children when you ca n't afford to stay at home is her choice .
even if we start off in a marriage and can stay at home while hubby works , we ca n't be blind to the fact that half of marriages and more relationships break down .
so there should always be the consideration that you will left holding babies , briefcase and the bottle .
until 40 % of men do n't lose touch with their children within a year of divorce , there is plenty of reason to drink !
lesley newton , uk hot news folks ; stress is for the most part self-induced .
it does n't matter if you 're a man or a woman - if you 're regularly reaching for the bottle after a day in the office you 're not cut out for the job .
me ?
i work a strictly 9-5 day , leaving plenty of time and energy for the wife , kids and most importantly myself .
i know i could earn a lot more money , but so what !
michael weston , austria the angle of this piece abuses the statistics it presents .
the percentage of senior women with a drinking problem is marginally more than that of the men .
is n't it more worrying that drinking too much is an issue throughout male society ?
even more offensive is the way this article tries to dress itself up as trying to protect poor ' downtrodden ' women and at the same time manages to imply they 're not capable of competing with men without turning to booze .
nice .
nicola monaghan , uk not entirely meaningless as it does indicate that women , given the monetary freedom and ego enhancing positions that men have always monopolised , act in much the same way as men do .
so , men are not -lsb- generalising terribly -rsb- the beer swilling health ignorant nutters they 're so frequently made out to be .
freedom , cash , and responsibility lead to one thing and one thing alone : a desire to forget .
nick , uk it 's not a case of emulating the men in their drinking habits .
it 's the fact that i 'm trying to combine a full time job at work with an equally demanding full time job at home as a mother of three .
why am i surprised that i am overweight and drinking to relieve the stress of it all ?
i 'm last on the list in the order of priorities , and knowing that this should not be the case and that i should be ' making more time for me ' puts on even more pressure .
come and walk in my shoes for a while anyone who wishes to judge !
jane , staffordshire the life of the reader from staffordshire sounds very much like mine : lawyer , with family and no time to put myself " first " .
i am learning , each day , how to balance the various demands on me better .
another reader said women have choices - yes , we do and i fail to see how making one should totally eliminate the others .
that would take us back to being defined by our bodies .
bms , canada this seems to be an abuse of statistics eamonn o 'riordan , ireland this seems to be an abuse of statistics .
" it is thought the stress of trying to compete with men for executive roles is partly to blame . "
you can think anything you like , but the evidence presented does not show any cause and effect .
maybe women who do n't have a drink problem self-select themselves out of the workforce before they can become part of senior management .
maybe men who are problem drinkers get fired sooner or drop dead earlier .
maybe women get more honest about their drinking as they get older while men delude themselves .
eamonn o 'riordan , ireland the phrase ' live and let live ' really highlights the issue - excessive drinking leads to all manner of health problems including premature death .
i 'm no teetotaller but still recognise that reaching for the bottle when you 're stressed often only makes things worse for you and those around you .
chris , belgium the frustration of working in what is effectively a " boys club " often sends me home fuming with rage and unfortunately this often results in venting my anger to a sympathetic friend over a bottle or three of wine .
f. newman , uae so women executives are turning to the booze .
i might have known that the only possible reason for this would be oppression by men and the " glass ceiling " .
perhaps when women like ms head stop banging on about it , all people will be judged on merit , not sex , colour or orientation .
joanne , uk alcohol , especially binge-drinking , is a huge problem for our country as a whole ; it has become part of our so-called ' culture ' and although it is true that women are n't able to cope physically with alcohol as well as men , this does n't stop it being just as much of a problem for men too .
lk , uk another meaningless survey , in my view .
live and let live i say .

they are also more inclined to turn to alcohol than men in similar grades , according to researchers at university college london .
it is thought the stress of trying to compete with men for executive roles is partly to blame .
the findings are published in the journal occupational environmental medicine .
about 8,000 government employees took part in the survey of men and women working at different levels in 20 departments in london .
the prevalence of problem drinking among the men was roughly the same -lrb- between 10 and 12 % -rrb- from clerical right through to senior executive grades .
but the picture was very different for women , who made up a third of the survey sample .
women at lower grades were less likely to be problem drinkers than men in comparable grades , but they caught up with men , overtaking them at senior grades .
it may be that women feel they have to compete on an equal footing and take on male roles and behaviours jenny head senior female executives were more than three times as likely to be problem drinkers -lrb- 14 % -rrb- as those working in the lowest clerical grades -lrb- 4 % -rrb- .
the employees were asked about the demands of their job , their levels of support at work and at home and the degree to which they could make and influence decisions .
they were also measured on a points basis for the amount of effort they made and the rewards they received in terms of promotional prospects , pay , and the sense of feeling valued .
glass ceiling the object of the research was to look at whether work stress was linked to alcohol dependence , said senior lecturer in epidemiology and public health at university college london jenny head , who led the research .
" it may be the stress for women of working against a glass ceiling is to blame , " she said .
" it may be that women feel they have to compete on an equal footing and take on male roles and behaviours .
" people who find they put in effort and do n't feel they are getting rewards are more at risk of becoming a problem drinker . "
" we have already shown that stressful conditions at work can lead to poorer health for people .
" this is just another way that stress can impact on health . "
" they are also turning to alcohol because they feel they are not being adequately rewarded for their efforts . "
drinking culture alcohol concern has revealed that the survey reinforces previous studies , which have shown that women at senior levels are drinking more .
the charity 's spokeswoman anne jenkins said : " we have to ask whether women are drinking more because they feel under pressure .
" but we have to ask what is the drinking culture in this organisation at upper levels .
" do they feel more stressed , or is it that they are drinking to keep up with their peers ? "
ms head is reluctant to suggest the findings reflect a general trend , but because this is an ongoing study , it is an issue they plan to investigate further in the future .
your comments i 'm a physicist and consequently work in a male-dominated profession , but ca n't say this bothers me , and i certainly do n't feel obliged to become ' one of the lads ' to succeed .
whilst i think high-flying women may turn to alcohol because they are frustrated by blatant discrimination -lrb- i.e. being paid less for the same work -rrb- , i think a lot of the stress comes the expectation that women working full-time should be domestic goddesses as well ... can someone tell me where we 're meant to find the time to cook , clean , iron and make our own curtains ? !
heather , uk no indication in this story on the proportion of the senior executives who were unmarried / not living with a partner .
i suspect that amongst the women the percentage was much higher - and that there is a correlation between being a singleton and drinking .
it 's so much easier at the end of a 12-hour work day to get home and have a drink or two - or even three , rather than get yourself something to eat .
sue , uk the statistics do not surprise me lesley newton , uk as a professional woman who does drink too much to relieve stress , and has many friends in the same position , i can only say that the statistics do not surprise me .
however the reader 's comments that we should ' walk in her shoes ' as a mother of three working full time puzzles me .
no one had to have children if they do n't want to in this day - life is all about choices , and having children when you ca n't afford to stay at home is her choice .
even if we start off in a marriage and can stay at home while hubby works , we ca n't be blind to the fact that half of marriages and more relationships break down .
so there should always be the consideration that you will left holding babies , briefcase and the bottle .
until 40 % of men do n't lose touch with their children within a year of divorce , there is plenty of reason to drink !
lesley newton , uk hot news folks ; stress is for the most part self-induced .
it does n't matter if you 're a man or a woman - if you 're regularly reaching for the bottle after a day in the office you 're not cut out for the job .

chris , belgium the frustration of working in what is effectively a " boys club " often sends me home fuming with rage and unfortunately this often results in venting my anger to a sympathetic friend over a bottle or three of wine .

lk , uk another meaningless survey , in my view .
live and let live i say .

but what was it like ?
the opening video sequence for the oscars featured michael moore being squashed by the foot of a giant olephant from the return of the king .
have your say did billy crystal do a good job ?
it was a declaration from the outset of how the emphasis on the 76th academy awards would be firmly about ditching the politics and , perhaps , the unease of last year .
sean connery kicked off the show with a portentous - and slightly ridiculous - speech about movies being the common link between all humanity .
but from then on , the emphasis was on fun all the way , helmed by billy crystal on a magnificent return to form .
following the recorded opening sequence - in which he appeared as almost every leading character from the nominated films - crystal strode onto stage beaming in a pair of sunglasses .
he burst into a brilliant sequence of rewritten songs - the sound of music 's favourite things was reversioned to become " this is the gang in the lord of the rings , " for example .
crystal called charlize theron " the future mrs crystal " it also included o ' man river rewritten to mystic river , with the lyric " men your age are either dead or dying - but not clint eastwood , you just keep rolling along . "
even better , crystal walked down into the audience to croon this right at eastwood 's side .
he finished the sequence with some panache , going down on one knee , arms outstretched .
but from blake edwards ' wheelchair speeding across the stage to adrien brody freshening his breath before announcing charlize theron as best actress , nearly everyone seemed to be playing for laughs .
robin williams - described by crystal as " the reason for our five-second delay " - managed to compress more or less his whole routine into a sublime three minutes while presenting best animated film .
julia roberts presented a tribute to the late katharine hepburn williams and crystal were not the only comedy duo appearing - ben stiller cropped up as a cardigan-wearing starsky , paired with a smartly-attired owen wilson , clearly not " playing " hutch .
later , jack black and will ferrell launched into a hilarious " you 're boring " song about those who made their speeches too long - a brave move considering their targets were sat right in front of them .
even the tributes to those who died last year - usually the solemnest moments of reflection - were played light .
tom hanks presented a particularly enjoyable collection of clips of 18-times oscars presenter bob hope , while julia roberts paid tribute to katharine hepburn by recalling one of her best lines - " acting is the most minor of gifts .
shirley temple could do it at the age of four " .
dig at bush meanwhile pink panther writer / director blake edwards used an on-stage slapstick routine to pick up his lifetime achievement award - he came on stage in an electric wheelchair , which then sped up and shot through a wall .
edwards re-emerged - helped by presenter jim carrey - in a dusty , torn suit .
crystal found a new comedy theme as the show went on and the lord of the rings : the return of the king continued on its historic sweep .
at one point he declared : " it 's now official - there 's nobody left in new zealand to thank . "
even tim robbins , widely expected to make a political speech , was beaming as he picked up his best supporting actor award , although he did go on to highlight the problems victims of abuse and violence face .
war message however politics was not entirely written out of the script .
crystal got huge laughs and applause for a dig at president bush - " i come and go as i please , so it 's kind of like the texas national guard . "
he also made a number of suggestions of various political figures ' favourite films - hilary clinton loved kill bill , donald rumsfeld confessions of a dangerous mind , while saddam hussein " loved holes . "
sean penn made a passing reference to the iraq situation as he picked up best actor , beginning his speech " if there 's one thing that actors know - other than that there are no wmds ... "
but only errol morris , picking up best documentary feature for vietnam study the fog of war , used the platform to hit the subject head on .
" i fear we 're going down a rabbit hole once again , " he said .
" if people can stop and think and reflect on some of this issues in this movie , perhaps i 've done some damn good here . "
crystal 's response ?
" i ca n't wait for his tax audit . "

but what was it like ?
the opening video sequence for the oscars featured michael moore being squashed by the foot of a giant olephant from the return of the king .
have your say did billy crystal do a good job ?
it was a declaration from the outset of how the emphasis on the 76th academy awards would be firmly about ditching the politics and , perhaps , the unease of last year .
sean connery kicked off the show with a portentous - and slightly ridiculous - speech about movies being the common link between all humanity .
but from then on , the emphasis was on fun all the way , helmed by billy crystal on a magnificent return to form .
following the recorded opening sequence - in which he appeared as almost every leading character from the nominated films - crystal strode onto stage beaming in a pair of sunglasses .
he burst into a brilliant sequence of rewritten songs - the sound of music 's favourite things was reversioned to become " this is the gang in the lord of the rings , " for example .
crystal called charlize theron " the future mrs crystal " it also included o ' man river rewritten to mystic river , with the lyric " men your age are either dead or dying - but not clint eastwood , you just keep rolling along . "
even better , crystal walked down into the audience to croon this right at eastwood 's side .
he finished the sequence with some panache , going down on one knee , arms outstretched .
but from blake edwards ' wheelchair speeding across the stage to adrien brody freshening his breath before announcing charlize theron as best actress , nearly everyone seemed to be playing for laughs .
robin williams - described by crystal as " the reason for our five-second delay " - managed to compress more or less his whole routine into a sublime three minutes while presenting best animated film .
julia roberts presented a tribute to the late katharine hepburn williams and crystal were not the only comedy duo appearing - ben stiller cropped up as a cardigan-wearing starsky , paired with a smartly-attired owen wilson , clearly not " playing " hutch .
later , jack black and will ferrell launched into a hilarious " you 're boring " song about those who made their speeches too long - a brave move considering their targets were sat right in front of them .
even the tributes to those who died last year - usually the solemnest moments of reflection - were played light .
tom hanks presented a particularly enjoyable collection of clips of 18-times oscars presenter bob hope , while julia roberts paid tribute to katharine hepburn by recalling one of her best lines - " acting is the most minor of gifts .
shirley temple could do it at the age of four " .
dig at bush meanwhile pink panther writer / director blake edwards used an on-stage slapstick routine to pick up his lifetime achievement award - he came on stage in an electric wheelchair , which then sped up and shot through a wall .
edwards re-emerged - helped by presenter jim carrey - in a dusty , torn suit .
crystal found a new comedy theme as the show went on and the lord of the rings : the return of the king continued on its historic sweep .
at one point he declared : " it 's now official - there 's nobody left in new zealand to thank . "
even tim robbins , widely expected to make a political speech , was beaming as he picked up his best supporting actor award , although he did go on to highlight the problems victims of abuse and violence face .
war message however politics was not entirely written out of the script .
crystal got huge laughs and applause for a dig at president bush - " i come and go as i please , so it 's kind of like the texas national guard . "
he also made a number of suggestions of various political figures ' favourite films - hilary clinton loved kill bill , donald rumsfeld confessions of a dangerous mind , while saddam hussein " loved holes . "
sean penn made a passing reference to the iraq situation as he picked up best actor , beginning his speech " if there 's one thing that actors know - other than that there are no wmds ... "
but only errol morris , picking up best documentary feature for vietnam study the fog of war , used the platform to hit the subject head on .
" i fear we 're going down a rabbit hole once again , " he said .
" if people can stop and think and reflect on some of this issues in this movie , perhaps i 've done some damn good here . "
crystal 's response ?
" i ca n't wait for his tax audit . "

the final part of the tolkien trilogy achieved a clean sweep , including best picture and director for peter jackson .
it became the first fantasy film to win best picture - and equalled the record trophy tally at the hollywood ceremony .
sean penn won best actor for his role in mystic river , with charlize theron named best actress for her part as a serial killer in monster .
renee zellweger and tim robbins won acting prizes for supporting roles for cold mountain and mystic river .
the return of the king 's haul of 11 statuettes equalled the totals won by ben hur in 1960 and titanic in 1998 .
but those two films did not win every award they were nominated for .
the return of the king also scooped best score , song , film editing , make-up and costume design .
its tally was completed by prizes for best adapted screenplay , art direction , visual effects and sound mixing .
accepting the best picture award , jackson described the achievement as " unbelievable " .
" i 'm so honoured that the academy and its members have seen past the trolls and the wizards and the hobbits and are recognising fantasy this year , " he said .
he earlier praised his " wonderful cast " and described it as an " incredibly overwhelming night " .
the awards signalled hollywood 's desire to reward jackson and his team for making three ground-breaking and hugely popular movies .
the two previous lord of the rings films had limited oscars success - picking up six prizes in minor categories out of 19 nominations between them .
but the trilogy has had tremendous box office success .
the return of the king has become the second most popular movie of all time , taking more than $ 1bn -lrb- £ 534m -rrb- at global box offices .
few had dared to predict a clean sweep - but there were no other big surprises on the night .
mystic river and master and commander won two awards each while lost in translation and cold mountain won one oscar each .
all four victorious actors had been hot favourites in their categories .
nevertheless , theron and zellweger gave highly emotional acceptance speeches .
theron , who won for her role as a serial killer in monster , said it had been " such an incredible year " .
her voice faltered as she thanked her mother .
" you have sacrificed so much for me to be able to live here and make my dreams come true , " the south african star said .
and zellweger , who starred in cold mountain , said she was " overwhelmed " and thanked her " immigrant mom and dad " for " never saying ' do n't try " ' . "
if there 's one thing actors know - other than that there are n't any wmds - it 's that there is no such thing as ' best ' in acting " sean penn penn and robbins both won for their roles in clint eastwood 's thriller mystic river - providing the film 's only awards of the night .
penn touched on politics in his speech , saying : " if there 's one thing actors know - other than that there are n't any wmds - it 's that there is no such thing as ' best ' in acting . "
but robbins did not get political , telling the audience : " this is really a lovely honour .
i 'd like to thank my fellow nominees , who were all spectacular . "
master and commander won for best sound editing and best cinematography .
sofia coppola picked up the award for best original screenplay for her film lost in translation , while finding nemo won best animated feature , as widely expected .
the fog of war was named best documentary feature - and producer errol morris gave the night 's most overtly political speech .
he said : " 40 years ago this country went down a rabbit hole in vietnam and millions died - i fear we 're going down a rabbit hole once again . "
and french-canadian comedy drama the barbarian invasions was named best foreign language film .
security was tight for the ceremony - but glitz and humour returned after last year 's ceremony was overshadowed by war .
the ceremony was hosted by comedian billy crystal , who has compèred the ceremony seven times before .
" for the very first time , we 're being simulcast in aramaic , " he joked , referring to the ancient language used in mel gibson 's film the passion of the christ .
there were also tributes to bob hope and katharine hepburn - who both died during the last 12 months .

the final part of the tolkien trilogy achieved a clean sweep , including best picture and director for peter jackson .
it became the first fantasy film to win best picture - and equalled the record trophy tally at the hollywood ceremony .
sean penn won best actor for his role in mystic river , with charlize theron named best actress for her part as a serial killer in monster .
renee zellweger and tim robbins won acting prizes for supporting roles for cold mountain and mystic river .
the return of the king 's haul of 11 statuettes equalled the totals won by ben hur in 1960 and titanic in 1998 .
but those two films did not win every award they were nominated for .
renee zellweger had been nominated for three years in a row the return of the king also scooped best score , song , film editing , make-up and costume design .
its tally was completed by prizes for best adapted screenplay , art direction , visual effects and sound mixing .
accepting the best picture award , jackson described the achievement as " unbelievable " .
" i 'm so honoured that the academy and its members have seen past the trolls and the wizards and the hobbits and are recognising fantasy this year , " he said .
he earlier praised his " wonderful cast " and described it as an " incredibly overwhelming night " .
the awards signalled hollywood 's desire to reward jackson and his team for making three ground-breaking and hugely popular movies .
the two previous lord of the rings films had limited oscars success - picking up six prizes in minor categories out of 19 nominations between them .
tim robbins did not deliver a political speech , as some expected but the trilogy has had tremendous box office success .
the return of the king has become the second most popular movie of all time , taking more than $ 1bn -lrb- £ 534m -rrb- at global box offices .
few had dared to predict a clean sweep - but there were no other big surprises on the night .
mystic river and master and commander won two awards each while lost in translation and cold mountain won one oscar each .
all four victorious actors had been hot favourites in their categories .
nevertheless , theron and zellweger gave highly emotional acceptance speeches .
theron , who won for her role as a serial killer in monster , said it had been " such an incredible year " .
