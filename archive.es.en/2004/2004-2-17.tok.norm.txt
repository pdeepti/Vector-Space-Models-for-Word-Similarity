christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .
merkel 's offer is superfluous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel flanked by a turkish army officer and german officials in front of the atatürk mausoleum in ankara dirk halm of the center for turkish studies in the german city of essen told dw-world merkel 's offer of a privileged status is " superfluous " anyway .
turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .
on the other hand , it seems that the 15 current and 10 incoming eu countries can not be integrated either , as has been demonstrated only too clearly by the failure to push through a european constitution . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german government cancels toll contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be europe 's most advanced toll system , now it 's germany 's biggest embarassment .
the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls .

so what are the alternatives now for germany ?

the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

but what are the alternatives to the toll collect idea ?
other european countries already have operating models that the germans could have adopted . austria since january , 2004 , the austrians have been subject to tolls under the microwave system operated by the firm europpass , a subsidiary of the italian group autostrade which is also a toll operator in italy .
the national toll system operates over so-called go boxes which are installed in the vehicles .
these boxes send microwave signals indicating where the truck is on the 2,000 kilometers of austria 's highways .
the truck driver can pay the toll for the distance driven at one of the 422 pay points across the country .
the average cost is 22 cents per kilometer and can be paid either before or after the journey .

if a toll payment is not recorded or a false one is made , details of the truck and driver are held and payment and additional fines are then demanded . europpass claims that annually 100,000 austrian and 300,000 foreign trucks use the roads , which could lead to an estimated € 600 million in toll payments .

the control of the distance and information is regulated by the satellite detection system gps . the system profits from the fact that switzerland charges a toll on all streets , which negates the need for the system to differentiate between road types as the proposed german and current austrian system does . france the toll is collected at access points along the road .

other european countries already have operating models that the germans could have adopted . austria since january , 2004 , the austrians have been subject to tolls under the microwave system operated by the firm europpass , a subsidiary of the italian group autostrade which is also a toll operator in italy .
the national toll system operates over so-called go boxes which are installed in the vehicles .
these boxes send microwave signals indicating where the truck is on the 2,000 kilometers of austria 's highways .
the truck driver can pay the toll for the distance driven at one of the 422 pay points across the country .
the average cost is 22 cents per kilometer and can be paid either before or after the journey .
the truck is then scanned along the route and its progress and distance recorded .
if a toll payment is not recorded or a false one is made , details of the truck and driver are held and payment and additional fines are then demanded . europpass claims that annually 100,000 austrian and 300,000 foreign trucks use the roads , which could lead to an estimated € 600 million in toll payments .

it counts the kilometers through impulses from the tachometer and stores the data on an electronic chip card .
this is then sent by post or internet to the toll control center .
the control of the distance and information is regulated by the satellite detection system gps . the system profits from the fact that switzerland charges a toll on all streets , which negates the need for the system to differentiate between road types as the proposed german and current austrian system does . france the toll is collected at access points along the road .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german government cancels toll contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be europe 's most advanced toll system , now it 's germany 's biggest embarassment .
the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .
the system is the world 's first to use satellite technology to record trucks ' highway mileage and automatically charge tolls .
-lrb- july 29 , 2003 -rrb- successful road toll models in europe after months of delays , the german toll collect experiment is now on hold and the contract with its proposed operator in tatters .
so what are the alternatives now for germany ?

palestinian prime minister qurie is in berlin for talks aimed at kickstarting the middle east peace plan .
after meeting with german president rau , qurie met with chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer . palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie arrived in berlin on monday , where he was greeted by german president johannes rau . the embattled leader is hoping to raise his profile and gather support for the palestinian cause a few weeks before his expected meeting with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .
they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .
" only through direct talks will the peace process get back on track , " said schröder . many plans on the table at the moment numerous middle east peace plans are currently on the table , including the original " road map " offered by the americans , and the geneva initiative , an unofficial peace plan drawn up by leading palestinian politicians and left-wing israeli figures that was unveiled in switzerland in november . last week at a security conference in munich , fischer surprised the international community by announcing his own plans for a middle east peace initiative , which called for nato to play a central role along with the eu and arab states . though criticized by some in europe , including the french - who say fischer failed to consult them first - the foreign minister 's efforts have added momentum to the stalled peace process ; yet they have also complicated the discussions by throwing another component into the picture .
after meeting with qurie , fischer once again stressed the need for increased european efforts .
" this is our neighboring region - we must help find an answer , " he said . israel critical of qurie a week before qurie 's arrival , the israeli government voiced criticism .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany , said qurie was a " failed leader , " who " should do his work at home before travelling to europe , " referring to qurie 's inadequate efforts - in the opinion of the israeli government - to stop terrorists attacks . all the same , qurie has signalled his desire to meet with israeli prime minister sharon , which he hopes will happen during the next two weeks .
representatives from both sides will come together on thursday to work out the logistics of such a meeting . after having already stopped in rome and brussels , qurie will leave berlin for paris on wednesday .
it remains to be seen , however , if the prime minister has the power and influence to turn this good-will tour into substantive policy .
his predecessor , mahmoud abbas , resigned after just one hundred days in office , mainly due to a power struggle with yassir arafat . likewise , qurie has struggled with arafat , at times threatening to resign himself .
but during his trip to berlin , he denied rumors that he had again threatened to step down .
" resign ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.02.2004 moma comes to berlin hailed by some as the cultural event of 2004 , more than 200 works from new york 's museum of modern art will go on display in berlin this week .
exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .
to educate the rest , the city 's been plastered with neon pink posters , announcing the arrival of a " best of " selection of works of art from the new york museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neue nationalgalerie with moma poster the seven-month exhibition at berlin 's neue nationalgalerie -lrb- new national gallery -rrb- will open on friday .
it became possible because moma itself is getting renovated and expanded for $ 850 million -lrb- € 662 million -rrb- and berlin offered a few million euros to art-sit for a while . moma officials also liked the idea , since the museum 's roots can be traced to the german capital : when visiting berlin in the 1920s , moma 's founding director , alfred h. barr , was inspired by the nationalgalerie 's department for recent contemporary art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " now , paintings such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night , " henri matisse 's " the dance " and paul cézanne 's " the bather " will be on display in berlin , along with meret oppenheimer 's fur cup , " breakfast in fur " and barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " -lrb- photo -rrb- . some unfulfilled wishes the germans were able to comprise a wish list but moma 's chief curator , john elderfield , made the final selection .
" we could not and did n't want to fulfill all requests , " elderfield told reporters , adding that while some had to be turned down for security reasons , others would not have fit the exhibition 's concept . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo 's " wrapped reichstag " still , those working at the nationalgalerie seem pleased with the result and proud that berlin has been chosen as the exhibition 's only international stop .
" this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition and the cultural event of 2004 , " said peter-klaus schuster , who heads both the nationalgalerie and the state museums of berlin . german foreign minister joschka fischer and u.s. secretary of state colin powell have agreed to serve as patrons for the exhibition .
the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 . " # b # some members of the city 's ailing tourism industry have already compared the exhibition to the 1995 " wrapped reichstag " by christo -lrb- photo -rrb- .
millions of visitors came to see germany 's parliament building completely covered with silver fabric .
although special moma packages that include accommodation and entrance fees have been slow sellers so far , berlin 's tourism officials expect things to pick up around easter . but others believe the show 's long duration might be counterproductive in terms of drawing the masses to berlin .
" an event becomes attractive if it 's short and unique , " wulf herzogenrath , the director of bremen 's kunsthalle museum , told the newsmagazine der spiegel . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moma in berlin read more news and background information about the exhibition in deutsche welle 's special coverage of " moma in berlin .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .
merkel 's offer is superfluous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel flanked by a turkish army officer and german officials in front of the atatürk mausoleum in ankara dirk halm of the center for turkish studies in the german city of essen told dw-world merkel 's offer of a privileged status is " superfluous " anyway .
turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .
on the other hand , it seems that the 15 current and 10 incoming eu countries can not be integrated either , as has been demonstrated only too clearly by the failure to push through a european constitution . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .
on the other hand , it seems that the 15 current and 10 incoming eu countries can not be integrated either , as has been demonstrated only too clearly by the failure to push through a european constitution . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german government cancels toll contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be europe 's most advanced toll system , now it 's germany 's biggest embarassment .
the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .

however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .

the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .

palestinian prime minister qurie is in berlin for talks aimed at kickstarting the middle east peace plan .
after meeting with german president rau , qurie met with chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer . palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie arrived in berlin on monday , where he was greeted by german president johannes rau . the embattled leader is hoping to raise his profile and gather support for the palestinian cause a few weeks before his expected meeting with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .
they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .
" only through direct talks will the peace process get back on track , " said schröder . many plans on the table at the moment numerous middle east peace plans are currently on the table , including the original " road map " offered by the americans , and the geneva initiative , an unofficial peace plan drawn up by leading palestinian politicians and left-wing israeli figures that was unveiled in switzerland in november . last week at a security conference in munich , fischer surprised the international community by announcing his own plans for a middle east peace initiative , which called for nato to play a central role along with the eu and arab states . though criticized by some in europe , including the french - who say fischer failed to consult them first - the foreign minister 's efforts have added momentum to the stalled peace process ; yet they have also complicated the discussions by throwing another component into the picture .
after meeting with qurie , fischer once again stressed the need for increased european efforts .
" this is our neighboring region - we must help find an answer , " he said . israel critical of qurie a week before qurie 's arrival , the israeli government voiced criticism .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany , said qurie was a " failed leader , " who " should do his work at home before travelling to europe , " referring to qurie 's inadequate efforts - in the opinion of the israeli government - to stop terrorists attacks . all the same , qurie has signalled his desire to meet with israeli prime minister sharon , which he hopes will happen during the next two weeks .
representatives from both sides will come together on thursday to work out the logistics of such a meeting . after having already stopped in rome and brussels , qurie will leave berlin for paris on wednesday .
it remains to be seen , however , if the prime minister has the power and influence to turn this good-will tour into substantive policy .
his predecessor , mahmoud abbas , resigned after just one hundred days in office , mainly due to a power struggle with yassir arafat . likewise , qurie has struggled with arafat , at times threatening to resign himself .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .
merkel 's offer is superfluous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel flanked by a turkish army officer and german officials in front of the atatürk mausoleum in ankara dirk halm of the center for turkish studies in the german city of essen told dw-world merkel 's offer of a privileged status is " superfluous " anyway .
turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .
on the other hand , it seems that the 15 current and 10 incoming eu countries can not be integrated either , as has been demonstrated only too clearly by the failure to push through a european constitution . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.02.2004 moma comes to berlin hailed by some as the cultural event of 2004 , more than 200 works from new york 's museum of modern art will go on display in berlin this week .
exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .
to educate the rest , the city 's been plastered with neon pink posters , announcing the arrival of a " best of " selection of works of art from the new york museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neue nationalgalerie with moma poster the seven-month exhibition at berlin 's neue nationalgalerie -lrb- new national gallery -rrb- will open on friday .
it became possible because moma itself is getting renovated and expanded for $ 850 million -lrb- € 662 million -rrb- and berlin offered a few million euros to art-sit for a while . moma officials also liked the idea , since the museum 's roots can be traced to the german capital : when visiting berlin in the 1920s , moma 's founding director , alfred h. barr , was inspired by the nationalgalerie 's department for recent contemporary art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " now , paintings such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night , " henri matisse 's " the dance " and paul cézanne 's " the bather " will be on display in berlin , along with meret oppenheimer 's fur cup , " breakfast in fur " and barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " -lrb- photo -rrb- . some unfulfilled wishes the germans were able to comprise a wish list but moma 's chief curator , john elderfield , made the final selection .
" we could not and did n't want to fulfill all requests , " elderfield told reporters , adding that while some had to be turned down for security reasons , others would not have fit the exhibition 's concept . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo 's " wrapped reichstag " still , those working at the nationalgalerie seem pleased with the result and proud that berlin has been chosen as the exhibition 's only international stop .
" this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition and the cultural event of 2004 , " said peter-klaus schuster , who heads both the nationalgalerie and the state museums of berlin . german foreign minister joschka fischer and u.s. secretary of state colin powell have agreed to serve as patrons for the exhibition .
the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 . " # b # some members of the city 's ailing tourism industry have already compared the exhibition to the 1995 " wrapped reichstag " by christo -lrb- photo -rrb- .
millions of visitors came to see germany 's parliament building completely covered with silver fabric .
although special moma packages that include accommodation and entrance fees have been slow sellers so far , berlin 's tourism officials expect things to pick up around easter . but others believe the show 's long duration might be counterproductive in terms of drawing the masses to berlin .

after months of delays , the german toll collect experiment is now on hold and the contract with its proposed operator in tatters .
so what are the alternatives now for germany ? the collapse of the proposed truck toll system deal in germany leaves the autobahn free for heavy vehicles to speed along uncharged - for now .
but what are the alternatives to the toll collect idea ?
other european countries already have operating models that the germans could have adopted . austria since january , 2004 , the austrians have been subject to tolls under the microwave system operated by the firm europpass , a subsidiary of the italian group autostrade which is also a toll operator in italy .
the national toll system operates over so-called go boxes which are installed in the vehicles .
these boxes send microwave signals indicating where the truck is on the 2,000 kilometers of austria 's highways .
the truck driver can pay the toll for the distance driven at one of the 422 pay points across the country .
the average cost is 22 cents per kilometer and can be paid either before or after the journey .
the truck is then scanned along the route and its progress and distance recorded .
if a toll payment is not recorded or a false one is made , details of the truck and driver are held and payment and additional fines are then demanded . europpass claims that annually 100,000 austrian and 300,000 foreign trucks use the roads , which could lead to an estimated € 600 million in toll payments .
the firm maintains that the system is efficient , functional and could have been easily introduced in germany . switzerland the electronic toll system in switzerland is a combination of satellite technology and impulses sent from an onboard tachometer which records distance from within the truck .
the system was introduced by the firm fela and just as the europpass system , few problems have been recorded .
at the heart of the toll system is the on-board installed capture device tripon .
it counts the kilometers through impulses from the tachometer and stores the data on an electronic chip card .
this is then sent by post or internet to the toll control center .
the control of the distance and information is regulated by the satellite detection system gps . the system profits from the fact that switzerland charges a toll on all streets , which negates the need for the system to differentiate between road types as the proposed german and current austrian system does . france the toll is collected at access points along the road .
at the entrance barrier , a ticket must be taken from the machine and then inserted at the exit barrier at the end of the stretch of road .
there the machine tells the truck driver how much needs to be paid to pass through the exit barrier and continue on the journey .
it 's a simple system which does n't require a lot of new technological developments . italy a similar toll system like the one in france is in place in italy .
an all-inclusive fee can be made at the start of the journey or section tolls can be paid at points along the way .
the french and italian systems were not taken into consideration in germany up to now . spain , britain and the netherlands in these countries , the microwave technology is used to record the toll fee .
records of the distance are recorded by points along the road and the truck is charged accordingly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government cancels toll contract the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt .

palestinian prime minister qurie is in berlin for talks aimed at kickstarting the middle east peace plan .
after meeting with german president rau , qurie met with chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer . palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie arrived in berlin on monday , where he was greeted by german president johannes rau . the embattled leader is hoping to raise his profile and gather support for the palestinian cause a few weeks before his expected meeting with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .
they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .
" only through direct talks will the peace process get back on track , " said schröder . many plans on the table at the moment numerous middle east peace plans are currently on the table , including the original " road map " offered by the americans , and the geneva initiative , an unofficial peace plan drawn up by leading palestinian politicians and left-wing israeli figures that was unveiled in switzerland in november . last week at a security conference in munich , fischer surprised the international community by announcing his own plans for a middle east peace initiative , which called for nato to play a central role along with the eu and arab states . though criticized by some in europe , including the french - who say fischer failed to consult them first - the foreign minister 's efforts have added momentum to the stalled peace process ; yet they have also complicated the discussions by throwing another component into the picture .
after meeting with qurie , fischer once again stressed the need for increased european efforts .
" this is our neighboring region - we must help find an answer , " he said . israel critical of qurie a week before qurie 's arrival , the israeli government voiced criticism .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany , said qurie was a " failed leader , " who " should do his work at home before travelling to europe , " referring to qurie 's inadequate efforts - in the opinion of the israeli government - to stop terrorists attacks . all the same , qurie has signalled his desire to meet with israeli prime minister sharon , which he hopes will happen during the next two weeks .
representatives from both sides will come together on thursday to work out the logistics of such a meeting . after having already stopped in rome and brussels , qurie will leave berlin for paris on wednesday .
it remains to be seen , however , if the prime minister has the power and influence to turn this good-will tour into substantive policy .
his predecessor , mahmoud abbas , resigned after just one hundred days in office , mainly due to a power struggle with yassir arafat . likewise , qurie has struggled with arafat , at times threatening to resign himself .
but during his trip to berlin , he denied rumors that he had again threatened to step down .
" resign ?
why would i ? " he said .
" i am here as the palestinian prime minister .
it has n't even occurred to me .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.02.2004 moma comes to berlin hailed by some as the cultural event of 2004 , more than 200 works from new york 's museum of modern art will go on display in berlin this week .
exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .
to educate the rest , the city 's been plastered with neon pink posters , announcing the arrival of a " best of " selection of works of art from the new york museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neue nationalgalerie with moma poster the seven-month exhibition at berlin 's neue nationalgalerie -lrb- new national gallery -rrb- will open on friday .
it became possible because moma itself is getting renovated and expanded for $ 850 million -lrb- € 662 million -rrb- and berlin offered a few million euros to art-sit for a while . moma officials also liked the idea , since the museum 's roots can be traced to the german capital : when visiting berlin in the 1920s , moma 's founding director , alfred h. barr , was inspired by the nationalgalerie 's department for recent contemporary art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " now , paintings such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night , " henri matisse 's " the dance " and paul cézanne 's " the bather " will be on display in berlin , along with meret oppenheimer 's fur cup , " breakfast in fur " and barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " -lrb- photo -rrb- . some unfulfilled wishes the germans were able to comprise a wish list but moma 's chief curator , john elderfield , made the final selection .
" we could not and did n't want to fulfill all requests , " elderfield told reporters , adding that while some had to be turned down for security reasons , others would not have fit the exhibition 's concept . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo 's " wrapped reichstag " still , those working at the nationalgalerie seem pleased with the result and proud that berlin has been chosen as the exhibition 's only international stop .
" this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition and the cultural event of 2004 , " said peter-klaus schuster , who heads both the nationalgalerie and the state museums of berlin . german foreign minister joschka fischer and u.s. secretary of state colin powell have agreed to serve as patrons for the exhibition .
the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 . " # b # some members of the city 's ailing tourism industry have already compared the exhibition to the 1995 " wrapped reichstag " by christo -lrb- photo -rrb- .
millions of visitors came to see germany 's parliament building completely covered with silver fabric .
although special moma packages that include accommodation and entrance fees have been slow sellers so far , berlin 's tourism officials expect things to pick up around easter . but others believe the show 's long duration might be counterproductive in terms of drawing the masses to berlin .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.02.2004 successful road toll models in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : successfully implemented in austria - the go box .
after months of delays , the german toll collect experiment is now on hold and the contract with its proposed operator in tatters .
so what are the alternatives now for germany ? the collapse of the proposed truck toll system deal in germany leaves the autobahn free for heavy vehicles to speed along uncharged - for now .
but what are the alternatives to the toll collect idea ?
other european countries already have operating models that the germans could have adopted . austria since january , 2004 , the austrians have been subject to tolls under the microwave system operated by the firm europpass , a subsidiary of the italian group autostrade which is also a toll operator in italy .
the national toll system operates over so-called go boxes which are installed in the vehicles .
these boxes send microwave signals indicating where the truck is on the 2,000 kilometers of austria 's highways .
the truck driver can pay the toll for the distance driven at one of the 422 pay points across the country .
the average cost is 22 cents per kilometer and can be paid either before or after the journey .
the truck is then scanned along the route and its progress and distance recorded .
if a toll payment is not recorded or a false one is made , details of the truck and driver are held and payment and additional fines are then demanded . europpass claims that annually 100,000 austrian and 300,000 foreign trucks use the roads , which could lead to an estimated € 600 million in toll payments .
the firm maintains that the system is efficient , functional and could have been easily introduced in germany . switzerland the electronic toll system in switzerland is a combination of satellite technology and impulses sent from an onboard tachometer which records distance from within the truck .
the system was introduced by the firm fela and just as the europpass system , few problems have been recorded .
at the heart of the toll system is the on-board installed capture device tripon .
it counts the kilometers through impulses from the tachometer and stores the data on an electronic chip card .
this is then sent by post or internet to the toll control center .
the control of the distance and information is regulated by the satellite detection system gps . the system profits from the fact that switzerland charges a toll on all streets , which negates the need for the system to differentiate between road types as the proposed german and current austrian system does . france the toll is collected at access points along the road .
at the entrance barrier , a ticket must be taken from the machine and then inserted at the exit barrier at the end of the stretch of road .
there the machine tells the truck driver how much needs to be paid to pass through the exit barrier and continue on the journey .
it 's a simple system which does n't require a lot of new technological developments . italy a similar toll system like the one in france is in place in italy .
an all-inclusive fee can be made at the start of the journey or section tolls can be paid at points along the way .
the french and italian systems were not taken into consideration in germany up to now . spain , britain and the netherlands in these countries , the microwave technology is used to record the toll fee .
records of the distance are recorded by points along the road and the truck is charged accordingly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government cancels toll contract the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german government cancels toll contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be europe 's most advanced toll system , now it 's germany 's biggest embarassment .
the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

after months of delays , the german toll collect experiment is now on hold and the contract with its proposed operator in tatters .
so what are the alternatives now for germany ? the collapse of the proposed truck toll system deal in germany leaves the autobahn free for heavy vehicles to speed along uncharged - for now .
but what are the alternatives to the toll collect idea ?
other european countries already have operating models that the germans could have adopted . austria since january , 2004 , the austrians have been subject to tolls under the microwave system operated by the firm europpass , a subsidiary of the italian group autostrade which is also a toll operator in italy .
the national toll system operates over so-called go boxes which are installed in the vehicles .
these boxes send microwave signals indicating where the truck is on the 2,000 kilometers of austria 's highways .
the truck driver can pay the toll for the distance driven at one of the 422 pay points across the country .
the average cost is 22 cents per kilometer and can be paid either before or after the journey .
the truck is then scanned along the route and its progress and distance recorded .
if a toll payment is not recorded or a false one is made , details of the truck and driver are held and payment and additional fines are then demanded . europpass claims that annually 100,000 austrian and 300,000 foreign trucks use the roads , which could lead to an estimated € 600 million in toll payments .
the firm maintains that the system is efficient , functional and could have been easily introduced in germany . switzerland the electronic toll system in switzerland is a combination of satellite technology and impulses sent from an onboard tachometer which records distance from within the truck .
the system was introduced by the firm fela and just as the europpass system , few problems have been recorded .
at the heart of the toll system is the on-board installed capture device tripon .
it counts the kilometers through impulses from the tachometer and stores the data on an electronic chip card .
this is then sent by post or internet to the toll control center .
the control of the distance and information is regulated by the satellite detection system gps . the system profits from the fact that switzerland charges a toll on all streets , which negates the need for the system to differentiate between road types as the proposed german and current austrian system does . france the toll is collected at access points along the road .
at the entrance barrier , a ticket must be taken from the machine and then inserted at the exit barrier at the end of the stretch of road .
there the machine tells the truck driver how much needs to be paid to pass through the exit barrier and continue on the journey .
it 's a simple system which does n't require a lot of new technological developments . italy a similar toll system like the one in france is in place in italy .
an all-inclusive fee can be made at the start of the journey or section tolls can be paid at points along the way .
the french and italian systems were not taken into consideration in germany up to now . spain , britain and the netherlands in these countries , the microwave technology is used to record the toll fee .
records of the distance are recorded by points along the road and the truck is charged accordingly . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german government cancels toll contract the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .

frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "

experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .

other european countries already have operating models that the germans could have adopted . austria since january , 2004 , the austrians have been subject to tolls under the microwave system operated by the firm europpass , a subsidiary of the italian group autostrade which is also a toll operator in italy .
the national toll system operates over so-called go boxes which are installed in the vehicles .
these boxes send microwave signals indicating where the truck is on the 2,000 kilometers of austria 's highways .
the truck driver can pay the toll for the distance driven at one of the 422 pay points across the country .
the average cost is 22 cents per kilometer and can be paid either before or after the journey .

if a toll payment is not recorded or a false one is made , details of the truck and driver are held and payment and additional fines are then demanded . europpass claims that annually 100,000 austrian and 300,000 foreign trucks use the roads , which could lead to an estimated € 600 million in toll payments .

at the heart of the toll system is the on-board installed capture device tripon .
it counts the kilometers through impulses from the tachometer and stores the data on an electronic chip card .
this is then sent by post or internet to the toll control center .
the control of the distance and information is regulated by the satellite detection system gps . the system profits from the fact that switzerland charges a toll on all streets , which negates the need for the system to differentiate between road types as the proposed german and current austrian system does . france the toll is collected at access points along the road .

palestinian prime minister qurie is in berlin for talks aimed at kickstarting the middle east peace plan .
after meeting with german president rau , qurie met with chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer . palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie arrived in berlin on monday , where he was greeted by german president johannes rau . the embattled leader is hoping to raise his profile and gather support for the palestinian cause a few weeks before his expected meeting with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .
they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .
" only through direct talks will the peace process get back on track , " said schröder . many plans on the table at the moment numerous middle east peace plans are currently on the table , including the original " road map " offered by the americans , and the geneva initiative , an unofficial peace plan drawn up by leading palestinian politicians and left-wing israeli figures that was unveiled in switzerland in november . last week at a security conference in munich , fischer surprised the international community by announcing his own plans for a middle east peace initiative , which called for nato to play a central role along with the eu and arab states . though criticized by some in europe , including the french - who say fischer failed to consult them first - the foreign minister 's efforts have added momentum to the stalled peace process ; yet they have also complicated the discussions by throwing another component into the picture .
after meeting with qurie , fischer once again stressed the need for increased european efforts .
" this is our neighboring region - we must help find an answer , " he said . israel critical of qurie a week before qurie 's arrival , the israeli government voiced criticism .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany , said qurie was a " failed leader , " who " should do his work at home before travelling to europe , " referring to qurie 's inadequate efforts - in the opinion of the israeli government - to stop terrorists attacks . all the same , qurie has signalled his desire to meet with israeli prime minister sharon , which he hopes will happen during the next two weeks .
representatives from both sides will come together on thursday to work out the logistics of such a meeting . after having already stopped in rome and brussels , qurie will leave berlin for paris on wednesday .
it remains to be seen , however , if the prime minister has the power and influence to turn this good-will tour into substantive policy .
his predecessor , mahmoud abbas , resigned after just one hundred days in office , mainly due to a power struggle with yassir arafat . likewise , qurie has struggled with arafat , at times threatening to resign himself .
but during his trip to berlin , he denied rumors that he had again threatened to step down .

palestinian prime minister qurie is in berlin for talks aimed at kickstarting the middle east peace plan .
after meeting with german president rau , qurie met with chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer . palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie arrived in berlin on monday , where he was greeted by german president johannes rau . the embattled leader is hoping to raise his profile and gather support for the palestinian cause a few weeks before his expected meeting with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .
they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .
" only through direct talks will the peace process get back on track , " said schröder . many plans on the table at the moment numerous middle east peace plans are currently on the table , including the original " road map " offered by the americans , and the geneva initiative , an unofficial peace plan drawn up by leading palestinian politicians and left-wing israeli figures that was unveiled in switzerland in november . last week at a security conference in munich , fischer surprised the international community by announcing his own plans for a middle east peace initiative , which called for nato to play a central role along with the eu and arab states . though criticized by some in europe , including the french - who say fischer failed to consult them first - the foreign minister 's efforts have added momentum to the stalled peace process ; yet they have also complicated the discussions by throwing another component into the picture .
after meeting with qurie , fischer once again stressed the need for increased european efforts .
" this is our neighboring region - we must help find an answer , " he said . israel critical of qurie a week before qurie 's arrival , the israeli government voiced criticism .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany , said qurie was a " failed leader , " who " should do his work at home before travelling to europe , " referring to qurie 's inadequate efforts - in the opinion of the israeli government - to stop terrorists attacks . all the same , qurie has signalled his desire to meet with israeli prime minister sharon , which he hopes will happen during the next two weeks .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .

turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .

exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .

it became possible because moma itself is getting renovated and expanded for $ 850 million -lrb- € 662 million -rrb- and berlin offered a few million euros to art-sit for a while . moma officials also liked the idea , since the museum 's roots can be traced to the german capital : when visiting berlin in the 1920s , moma 's founding director , alfred h. barr , was inspired by the nationalgalerie 's department for recent contemporary art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " now , paintings such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night , " henri matisse 's " the dance " and paul cézanne 's " the bather " will be on display in berlin , along with meret oppenheimer 's fur cup , " breakfast in fur " and barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " -lrb- photo -rrb- . some unfulfilled wishes the germans were able to comprise a wish list but moma 's chief curator , john elderfield , made the final selection .

the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 .

millions of visitors came to see germany 's parliament building completely covered with silver fabric .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german government cancels toll contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be europe 's most advanced toll system , now it 's germany 's biggest embarassment .
the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .
to educate the rest , the city 's been plastered with neon pink posters , announcing the arrival of a " best of " selection of works of art from the new york museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neue nationalgalerie with moma poster the seven-month exhibition at berlin 's neue nationalgalerie -lrb- new national gallery -rrb- will open on friday .
it became possible because moma itself is getting renovated and expanded for $ 850 million -lrb- € 662 million -rrb- and berlin offered a few million euros to art-sit for a while . moma officials also liked the idea , since the museum 's roots can be traced to the german capital : when visiting berlin in the 1920s , moma 's founding director , alfred h. barr , was inspired by the nationalgalerie 's department for recent contemporary art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " now , paintings such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night , " henri matisse 's " the dance " and paul cézanne 's " the bather " will be on display in berlin , along with meret oppenheimer 's fur cup , " breakfast in fur " and barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " -lrb- photo -rrb- . some unfulfilled wishes the germans were able to comprise a wish list but moma 's chief curator , john elderfield , made the final selection .

the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german scientists to test hiv vaccine on humans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg are gearing up for clinical trials on a hiv vaccine .
scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

other european countries already have operating models that the germans could have adopted . austria since january , 2004 , the austrians have been subject to tolls under the microwave system operated by the firm europpass , a subsidiary of the italian group autostrade which is also a toll operator in italy .
the national toll system operates over so-called go boxes which are installed in the vehicles .
these boxes send microwave signals indicating where the truck is on the 2,000 kilometers of austria 's highways .
the truck driver can pay the toll for the distance driven at one of the 422 pay points across the country .
the average cost is 22 cents per kilometer and can be paid either before or after the journey .
the truck is then scanned along the route and its progress and distance recorded .
if a toll payment is not recorded or a false one is made , details of the truck and driver are held and payment and additional fines are then demanded . europpass claims that annually 100,000 austrian and 300,000 foreign trucks use the roads , which could lead to an estimated € 600 million in toll payments .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .

palestinian prime minister qurie is in berlin for talks aimed at kickstarting the middle east peace plan .
after meeting with german president rau , qurie met with chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer . palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie arrived in berlin on monday , where he was greeted by german president johannes rau . the embattled leader is hoping to raise his profile and gather support for the palestinian cause a few weeks before his expected meeting with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .
they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .

they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .
" only through direct talks will the peace process get back on track , " said schröder . many plans on the table at the moment numerous middle east peace plans are currently on the table , including the original " road map " offered by the americans , and the geneva initiative , an unofficial peace plan drawn up by leading palestinian politicians and left-wing israeli figures that was unveiled in switzerland in november . last week at a security conference in munich , fischer surprised the international community by announcing his own plans for a middle east peace initiative , which called for nato to play a central role along with the eu and arab states . though criticized by some in europe , including the french - who say fischer failed to consult them first - the foreign minister 's efforts have added momentum to the stalled peace process ; yet they have also complicated the discussions by throwing another component into the picture .
after meeting with qurie , fischer once again stressed the need for increased european efforts .
" this is our neighboring region - we must help find an answer , " he said . israel critical of qurie a week before qurie 's arrival , the israeli government voiced criticism .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany , said qurie was a " failed leader , " who " should do his work at home before travelling to europe , " referring to qurie 's inadequate efforts - in the opinion of the israeli government - to stop terrorists attacks . all the same , qurie has signalled his desire to meet with israeli prime minister sharon , which he hopes will happen during the next two weeks .
representatives from both sides will come together on thursday to work out the logistics of such a meeting . after having already stopped in rome and brussels , qurie will leave berlin for paris on wednesday .
it remains to be seen , however , if the prime minister has the power and influence to turn this good-will tour into substantive policy .
his predecessor , mahmoud abbas , resigned after just one hundred days in office , mainly due to a power struggle with yassir arafat . likewise , qurie has struggled with arafat , at times threatening to resign himself .
but during his trip to berlin , he denied rumors that he had again threatened to step down .
" resign ?
why would i ? " he said .
" i am here as the palestinian prime minister .
it has n't even occurred to me . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a wider europe in israel german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .

turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .
to educate the rest , the city 's been plastered with neon pink posters , announcing the arrival of a " best of " selection of works of art from the new york museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neue nationalgalerie with moma poster the seven-month exhibition at berlin 's neue nationalgalerie -lrb- new national gallery -rrb- will open on friday .
it became possible because moma itself is getting renovated and expanded for $ 850 million -lrb- € 662 million -rrb- and berlin offered a few million euros to art-sit for a while . moma officials also liked the idea , since the museum 's roots can be traced to the german capital : when visiting berlin in the 1920s , moma 's founding director , alfred h. barr , was inspired by the nationalgalerie 's department for recent contemporary art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " now , paintings such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night , " henri matisse 's " the dance " and paul cézanne 's " the bather " will be on display in berlin , along with meret oppenheimer 's fur cup , " breakfast in fur " and barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " -lrb- photo -rrb- . some unfulfilled wishes the germans were able to comprise a wish list but moma 's chief curator , john elderfield , made the final selection .

" this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition and the cultural event of 2004 , " said peter-klaus schuster , who heads both the nationalgalerie and the state museums of berlin . german foreign minister joschka fischer and u.s. secretary of state colin powell have agreed to serve as patrons for the exhibition .
the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 .

millions of visitors came to see germany 's parliament building completely covered with silver fabric .
although special moma packages that include accommodation and entrance fees have been slow sellers so far , berlin 's tourism officials expect things to pick up around easter . but others believe the show 's long duration might be counterproductive in terms of drawing the masses to berlin .

exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .

the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german government cancels toll contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be europe 's most advanced toll system , now it 's germany 's biggest embarassment .
the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .
merkel 's offer is superfluous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel flanked by a turkish army officer and german officials in front of the atatürk mausoleum in ankara dirk halm of the center for turkish studies in the german city of essen told dw-world merkel 's offer of a privileged status is " superfluous " anyway .
turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .
on the other hand , it seems that the 15 current and 10 incoming eu countries can not be integrated either , as has been demonstrated only too clearly by the failure to push through a european constitution . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

16 , 2003 -rrb- merkel ’ s message to turkey – “ no ” after months of populist opposition to turkey ’ s eu bid , german conservative leader angela merkel has arrived to a skeptical reception in ankara and warnings not to exploit the issue for narrow electoral gains .

the berlin lawyers who handled the suits said their clients would receive around € 300 -lrb- $ 386 -rrb- per month for at least five years .
the defense ministry reported that 1,094 professional soldiers and conscripts who served in the east german army had applied for compensation .
the majority of the claims wo n't be recognized , however , since no connection between the illness and the work with radars has been proved , a ministry spokeswoman told the german news agency dpa .
still , other former soldiers , in addition to the five , would have their claims recognized , she said , without indicating how many .
the former soldiers suffer from cancer , leukemia and cataracts . more briefs 16.02.2004 -pipe- first hiv vaccine test in germany starts 16.02.2004 -pipe- spd leader says no backtracking on health reforms 15.02.2004 -pipe- police to use mobile phone text messages to fight crime 15.02.2004 -pipe- berlin and brussels scrap over eu budget 15.02.2004 -pipe- struck sees no imminent nato role in iraq 13.02.2004 -pipe- german team wins biathlon gold 13.02.2004 -pipe- teachers trip on chocolate hash cake 13.02.2004 -pipe- spd popularity reaches record low radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .
to educate the rest , the city 's been plastered with neon pink posters , announcing the arrival of a " best of " selection of works of art from the new york museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neue nationalgalerie with moma poster the seven-month exhibition at berlin 's neue nationalgalerie -lrb- new national gallery -rrb- will open on friday .
it became possible because moma itself is getting renovated and expanded for $ 850 million -lrb- € 662 million -rrb- and berlin offered a few million euros to art-sit for a while . moma officials also liked the idea , since the museum 's roots can be traced to the german capital : when visiting berlin in the 1920s , moma 's founding director , alfred h. barr , was inspired by the nationalgalerie 's department for recent contemporary art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " now , paintings such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night , " henri matisse 's " the dance " and paul cézanne 's " the bather " will be on display in berlin , along with meret oppenheimer 's fur cup , " breakfast in fur " and barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " -lrb- photo -rrb- . some unfulfilled wishes the germans were able to comprise a wish list but moma 's chief curator , john elderfield , made the final selection .

the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 . " # b # some members of the city 's ailing tourism industry have already compared the exhibition to the 1995 " wrapped reichstag " by christo -lrb- photo -rrb- .
millions of visitors came to see germany 's parliament building completely covered with silver fabric .
although special moma packages that include accommodation and entrance fees have been slow sellers so far , berlin 's tourism officials expect things to pick up around easter . but others believe the show 's long duration might be counterproductive in terms of drawing the masses to berlin .

palestinian prime minister qurie is in berlin for talks aimed at kickstarting the middle east peace plan .
after meeting with german president rau , qurie met with chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer . palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie arrived in berlin on monday , where he was greeted by german president johannes rau . the embattled leader is hoping to raise his profile and gather support for the palestinian cause a few weeks before his expected meeting with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .
they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .
" only through direct talks will the peace process get back on track , " said schröder . many plans on the table at the moment numerous middle east peace plans are currently on the table , including the original " road map " offered by the americans , and the geneva initiative , an unofficial peace plan drawn up by leading palestinian politicians and left-wing israeli figures that was unveiled in switzerland in november . last week at a security conference in munich , fischer surprised the international community by announcing his own plans for a middle east peace initiative , which called for nato to play a central role along with the eu and arab states . though criticized by some in europe , including the french - who say fischer failed to consult them first - the foreign minister 's efforts have added momentum to the stalled peace process ; yet they have also complicated the discussions by throwing another component into the picture .
after meeting with qurie , fischer once again stressed the need for increased european efforts .
" this is our neighboring region - we must help find an answer , " he said . israel critical of qurie a week before qurie 's arrival , the israeli government voiced criticism .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany , said qurie was a " failed leader , " who " should do his work at home before travelling to europe , " referring to qurie 's inadequate efforts - in the opinion of the israeli government - to stop terrorists attacks . all the same , qurie has signalled his desire to meet with israeli prime minister sharon , which he hopes will happen during the next two weeks .
representatives from both sides will come together on thursday to work out the logistics of such a meeting . after having already stopped in rome and brussels , qurie will leave berlin for paris on wednesday .
it remains to be seen , however , if the prime minister has the power and influence to turn this good-will tour into substantive policy .
his predecessor , mahmoud abbas , resigned after just one hundred days in office , mainly due to a power struggle with yassir arafat . likewise , qurie has struggled with arafat , at times threatening to resign himself .
but during his trip to berlin , he denied rumors that he had again threatened to step down .
" resign ?
why would i ? " he said .
" i am here as the palestinian prime minister .
it has n't even occurred to me .

on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations .

after months of delays , the german toll collect experiment is now on hold and the contract with its proposed operator in tatters .
so what are the alternatives now for germany ? the collapse of the proposed truck toll system deal in germany leaves the autobahn free for heavy vehicles to speed along uncharged - for now .
but what are the alternatives to the toll collect idea ?
other european countries already have operating models that the germans could have adopted . austria since january , 2004 , the austrians have been subject to tolls under the microwave system operated by the firm europpass , a subsidiary of the italian group autostrade which is also a toll operator in italy .
the national toll system operates over so-called go boxes which are installed in the vehicles .
these boxes send microwave signals indicating where the truck is on the 2,000 kilometers of austria 's highways .
the truck driver can pay the toll for the distance driven at one of the 422 pay points across the country .
the average cost is 22 cents per kilometer and can be paid either before or after the journey .
the truck is then scanned along the route and its progress and distance recorded .
if a toll payment is not recorded or a false one is made , details of the truck and driver are held and payment and additional fines are then demanded . europpass claims that annually 100,000 austrian and 300,000 foreign trucks use the roads , which could lead to an estimated € 600 million in toll payments .
the firm maintains that the system is efficient , functional and could have been easily introduced in germany . switzerland the electronic toll system in switzerland is a combination of satellite technology and impulses sent from an onboard tachometer which records distance from within the truck .
the system was introduced by the firm fela and just as the europpass system , few problems have been recorded .
at the heart of the toll system is the on-board installed capture device tripon .
it counts the kilometers through impulses from the tachometer and stores the data on an electronic chip card .
this is then sent by post or internet to the toll control center .
the control of the distance and information is regulated by the satellite detection system gps . the system profits from the fact that switzerland charges a toll on all streets , which negates the need for the system to differentiate between road types as the proposed german and current austrian system does . france the toll is collected at access points along the road .
at the entrance barrier , a ticket must be taken from the machine and then inserted at the exit barrier at the end of the stretch of road .
there the machine tells the truck driver how much needs to be paid to pass through the exit barrier and continue on the journey .
it 's a simple system which does n't require a lot of new technological developments . italy a similar toll system like the one in france is in place in italy .
an all-inclusive fee can be made at the start of the journey or section tolls can be paid at points along the way .
the french and italian systems were not taken into consideration in germany up to now . spain , britain and the netherlands in these countries , the microwave technology is used to record the toll fee .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german scientists to test hiv vaccine on humans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg are gearing up for clinical trials on a hiv vaccine .
scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

palestinian prime minister qurie is in berlin for talks aimed at kickstarting the middle east peace plan .
after meeting with german president rau , qurie met with chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer . palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie arrived in berlin on monday , where he was greeted by german president johannes rau . the embattled leader is hoping to raise his profile and gather support for the palestinian cause a few weeks before his expected meeting with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german government cancels toll contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be europe 's most advanced toll system , now it 's germany 's biggest embarassment .
the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .
merkel 's offer is superfluous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel flanked by a turkish army officer and german officials in front of the atatürk mausoleum in ankara dirk halm of the center for turkish studies in the german city of essen told dw-world merkel 's offer of a privileged status is " superfluous " anyway .
turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .
on the other hand , it seems that the 15 current and 10 incoming eu countries can not be integrated either , as has been demonstrated only too clearly by the failure to push through a european constitution . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .
merkel 's offer is superfluous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel flanked by a turkish army officer and german officials in front of the atatürk mausoleum in ankara dirk halm of the center for turkish studies in the german city of essen told dw-world merkel 's offer of a privileged status is " superfluous " anyway .
turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .

the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .
merkel 's offer is superfluous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel flanked by a turkish army officer and german officials in front of the atatürk mausoleum in ankara dirk halm of the center for turkish studies in the german city of essen told dw-world merkel 's offer of a privileged status is " superfluous " anyway .
turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .

exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .
to educate the rest , the city 's been plastered with neon pink posters , announcing the arrival of a " best of " selection of works of art from the new york museum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's neue nationalgalerie with moma poster the seven-month exhibition at berlin 's neue nationalgalerie -lrb- new national gallery -rrb- will open on friday .
it became possible because moma itself is getting renovated and expanded for $ 850 million -lrb- € 662 million -rrb- and berlin offered a few million euros to art-sit for a while . moma officials also liked the idea , since the museum 's roots can be traced to the german capital : when visiting berlin in the 1920s , moma 's founding director , alfred h. barr , was inspired by the nationalgalerie 's department for recent contemporary art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " now , paintings such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night , " henri matisse 's " the dance " and paul cézanne 's " the bather " will be on display in berlin , along with meret oppenheimer 's fur cup , " breakfast in fur " and barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " -lrb- photo -rrb- . some unfulfilled wishes the germans were able to comprise a wish list but moma 's chief curator , john elderfield , made the final selection .
" we could not and did n't want to fulfill all requests , " elderfield told reporters , adding that while some had to be turned down for security reasons , others would not have fit the exhibition 's concept . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo 's " wrapped reichstag " still , those working at the nationalgalerie seem pleased with the result and proud that berlin has been chosen as the exhibition 's only international stop .
" this is going to be a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition and the cultural event of 2004 , " said peter-klaus schuster , who heads both the nationalgalerie and the state museums of berlin . german foreign minister joschka fischer and u.s. secretary of state colin powell have agreed to serve as patrons for the exhibition .
the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 .

millions of visitors came to see germany 's parliament building completely covered with silver fabric .
although special moma packages that include accommodation and entrance fees have been slow sellers so far , berlin 's tourism officials expect things to pick up around easter . but others believe the show 's long duration might be counterproductive in terms of drawing the masses to berlin .

exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .

it became possible because moma itself is getting renovated and expanded for $ 850 million -lrb- € 662 million -rrb- and berlin offered a few million euros to art-sit for a while . moma officials also liked the idea , since the museum 's roots can be traced to the german capital : when visiting berlin in the 1920s , moma 's founding director , alfred h. barr , was inspired by the nationalgalerie 's department for recent contemporary art . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " now , paintings such as vincent van gogh 's " starry night , " henri matisse 's " the dance " and paul cézanne 's " the bather " will be on display in berlin , along with meret oppenheimer 's fur cup , " breakfast in fur " and barnett newman 's " broken obelisk " -lrb- photo -rrb- . some unfulfilled wishes the germans were able to comprise a wish list but moma 's chief curator , john elderfield , made the final selection .

the german government vouches for the art works ' safety , since insurance for the collection , which is estimated to be worth several hundred million dollars , would have been too expensive . the overall cost of € 8.5 million that includes lending fees , security and transportation , has been shouldered by the museum 's support group , friends of the nationalgalerie .
to recoup the money , the organization hopes 100,000 visitors per month will each pay between € 5 and € 27 to see the show . berlin tourism industry has high hopes not only those at the museum have high hopes for the event : many of the city 's other cultural institutions are participating in a supporting program called " american season 2004 .

millions of visitors came to see germany 's parliament building completely covered with silver fabric .
although special moma packages that include accommodation and entrance fees have been slow sellers so far , berlin 's tourism officials expect things to pick up around easter . but others believe the show 's long duration might be counterproductive in terms of drawing the masses to berlin .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .
merkel 's offer is superfluous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel flanked by a turkish army officer and german officials in front of the atatürk mausoleum in ankara dirk halm of the center for turkish studies in the german city of essen told dw-world merkel 's offer of a privileged status is " superfluous " anyway .
turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .
on the other hand , it seems that the 15 current and 10 incoming eu countries can not be integrated either , as has been demonstrated only too clearly by the failure to push through a european constitution . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

palestinian prime minister qurie is in berlin for talks aimed at kickstarting the middle east peace plan .
after meeting with german president rau , qurie met with chancellor schröder and foreign minister fischer . palestinian prime minister ahmed qurie arrived in berlin on monday , where he was greeted by german president johannes rau . the embattled leader is hoping to raise his profile and gather support for the palestinian cause a few weeks before his expected meeting with israeli prime minister ariel sharon .
the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .
they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .
" only through direct talks will the peace process get back on track , " said schröder . many plans on the table at the moment numerous middle east peace plans are currently on the table , including the original " road map " offered by the americans , and the geneva initiative , an unofficial peace plan drawn up by leading palestinian politicians and left-wing israeli figures that was unveiled in switzerland in november . last week at a security conference in munich , fischer surprised the international community by announcing his own plans for a middle east peace initiative , which called for nato to play a central role along with the eu and arab states . though criticized by some in europe , including the french - who say fischer failed to consult them first - the foreign minister 's efforts have added momentum to the stalled peace process ; yet they have also complicated the discussions by throwing another component into the picture .
after meeting with qurie , fischer once again stressed the need for increased european efforts .
" this is our neighboring region - we must help find an answer , " he said . israel critical of qurie a week before qurie 's arrival , the israeli government voiced criticism .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany , said qurie was a " failed leader , " who " should do his work at home before travelling to europe , " referring to qurie 's inadequate efforts - in the opinion of the israeli government - to stop terrorists attacks . all the same , qurie has signalled his desire to meet with israeli prime minister sharon , which he hopes will happen during the next two weeks .
representatives from both sides will come together on thursday to work out the logistics of such a meeting . after having already stopped in rome and brussels , qurie will leave berlin for paris on wednesday .
it remains to be seen , however , if the prime minister has the power and influence to turn this good-will tour into substantive policy .
his predecessor , mahmoud abbas , resigned after just one hundred days in office , mainly due to a power struggle with yassir arafat . likewise , qurie has struggled with arafat , at times threatening to resign himself .
but during his trip to berlin , he denied rumors that he had again threatened to step down .
" resign ?
why would i ? " he said .
" i am here as the palestinian prime minister .
it has n't even occurred to me . " dw staff -lrb- kz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a wider europe in israel german foreign minister fischer irritated his eu colleagues recently by calling for a new road map for middle east peace with nato in center-stage .
on monday , he visited israel to talk about eu-israeli relations .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

exhibit organizers are not the only ones hoping for lots of visitors . when the people in charge of moma in berlin 's advertising campaign asked berliners what the acronym stood for , only 2 percent knew the right answer .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .
and not only that , he added , if turkey acceded to the eu , many turks living in germany might even return home .
germany 's largest ethnic community some 2.5 million turks currently live in germany , making them by far the largest ethnic group .
many are former " gastarbeiter , " or " guest workers " recruited in the early post-war years to meet the high demand for labor during germany 's economic miracle .
although they have lived and worked in germany for decades ; the majority of them still retain their turkish citizenship and return home for regular visits .
merkel 's offer is superfluous bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel flanked by a turkish army officer and german officials in front of the atatürk mausoleum in ankara dirk halm of the center for turkish studies in the german city of essen told dw-world merkel 's offer of a privileged status is " superfluous " anyway .
turkey already has a special relationship with the eu , he said .
" unfortunately , this has not benefited turkey , since foreign trade has developed in the eu 's favor , " halm explained .
in view of the cdu 's repeated opposition to turkey 's eu bid as part of the party 's campaign for june 's european parliament election , halm said merkel 's proposal was " simply a way of trying to keep turkey quiet . "
" turkey 's suitability to join the european union is in any case not an appropriate election campaign issue , as it is much too complicated to get across to voters , " halm said .
" after all , brussels has so far only promised to grant an audience to turkey at the end of this year to decide whether or not to set a date for the start of accession negotiations , which could take years . "
apart from that , halm said opinion polls have shown that most germans do not find the topic exactly riveting .
european integration german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer have been among the firmest supporters of turkey 's eu aspirations , but many other european politicians fear it would be virtually impossible to integrate the largely muslim country into the eu .
on the other hand , it seems that the 15 current and 10 incoming eu countries can not be integrated either , as has been demonstrated only too clearly by the failure to push through a european constitution . dw staff -lrb- bp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey 's erdogan rejects eu partnership proposal turkish premier recep tayyip erdogan on monday rejected a proposal by germany 's christian democrats to establish a " privileged partnership " with the eu rather than admit turkey as a full member of the union .

christian democrat party leader angela merkel has created a stir in germany 's turkish community for her refusal to consider admitting the largely muslim country into the european bloc . the federal president of the turkish community in germany , hakki keskin , has strongly criticized merkel 's proposal for offering ankara a privileged eu partnership instead of full-fledged membership .
keskin told the hanover-based daily neue presse he thought the offer was the height of impertinence .
he recalled that turkey had been associated with the european union for nearly 40 years and should accept nothing less than full membership .
" such discrimination is outrageous , " he maintained .
heskin went on to criticize the notion - held by many in merkels christian democrats union - that turkish membership of the eu would result in a new mass-migration of turks to germany .
he pointed out that turkey 's economy was growing in a more dynamic way than germany 's , and if turkey were given a clear perspective for eu membership , many turkish firms would invest in germany .

the meeting with sharon will be a watershed moment for qurie - an opportunity for the prime minister , who is engaged in a power struggle with the palestinian president yassir arafat , to gain credibility with the palestinians . on tuesday , qurie met with both german chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer .
they sorted through various peace plans currently circulating and attempted to re-energize the peace process , which has stalled amid renewed violence and the continued construction of a security fence by the israelis . after meeting with qurie , schröder called on both parties - the israelis and palestinians - to return to the " road map " meant to pave the way to a stable peace and fulfill their obligations .
he also welcomed the possibility of a meeting between qurie and sharon .
" only through direct talks will the peace process get back on track , " said schröder . many plans on the table at the moment numerous middle east peace plans are currently on the table , including the original " road map " offered by the americans , and the geneva initiative , an unofficial peace plan drawn up by leading palestinian politicians and left-wing israeli figures that was unveiled in switzerland in november . last week at a security conference in munich , fischer surprised the international community by announcing his own plans for a middle east peace initiative , which called for nato to play a central role along with the eu and arab states . though criticized by some in europe , including the french - who say fischer failed to consult them first - the foreign minister 's efforts have added momentum to the stalled peace process ; yet they have also complicated the discussions by throwing another component into the picture .
after meeting with qurie , fischer once again stressed the need for increased european efforts .
" this is our neighboring region - we must help find an answer , " he said . israel critical of qurie a week before qurie 's arrival , the israeli government voiced criticism .
shimon stein , israel 's ambassador to germany , said qurie was a " failed leader , " who " should do his work at home before travelling to europe , " referring to qurie 's inadequate efforts - in the opinion of the israeli government - to stop terrorists attacks . all the same , qurie has signalled his desire to meet with israeli prime minister sharon , which he hopes will happen during the next two weeks .
representatives from both sides will come together on thursday to work out the logistics of such a meeting . after having already stopped in rome and brussels , qurie will leave berlin for paris on wednesday .
it remains to be seen , however , if the prime minister has the power and influence to turn this good-will tour into substantive policy .
his predecessor , mahmoud abbas , resigned after just one hundred days in office , mainly due to a power struggle with yassir arafat . likewise , qurie has struggled with arafat , at times threatening to resign himself .

other european countries already have operating models that the germans could have adopted . austria since january , 2004 , the austrians have been subject to tolls under the microwave system operated by the firm europpass , a subsidiary of the italian group autostrade which is also a toll operator in italy .
the national toll system operates over so-called go boxes which are installed in the vehicles .
these boxes send microwave signals indicating where the truck is on the 2,000 kilometers of austria 's highways .
the truck driver can pay the toll for the distance driven at one of the 422 pay points across the country .
the average cost is 22 cents per kilometer and can be paid either before or after the journey .

if a toll payment is not recorded or a false one is made , details of the truck and driver are held and payment and additional fines are then demanded . europpass claims that annually 100,000 austrian and 300,000 foreign trucks use the roads , which could lead to an estimated € 600 million in toll payments .

at the heart of the toll system is the on-board installed capture device tripon .
it counts the kilometers through impulses from the tachometer and stores the data on an electronic chip card .
this is then sent by post or internet to the toll control center .
the control of the distance and information is regulated by the satellite detection system gps . the system profits from the fact that switzerland charges a toll on all streets , which negates the need for the system to differentiate between road types as the proposed german and current austrian system does . france the toll is collected at access points along the road .

the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.02.2004 german government cancels toll contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was supposed to be europe 's most advanced toll system , now it 's germany 's biggest embarassment .
the debacle over the proposed truck toll collection system in germany has come to an embarrassing end with the government cancelling the contract with toll collect , the syndicate behind the failed attempt . after many months of painfully embarrassing delays and a further eleven hours of marathon negotiations monday evening , the german government cancelled the contract for the proposed heavy vehicle toll on tuesday . toll collect , the syndicate responsible for the proposed toll system which included such commercial giants as daimlerchrysler , deutsche telekom and french motorways operator cofiroute , admitted that its system would not be up and running before 2006 .
as a result , berlin announced it would cancel the contract despite the months and millions invested in the project . now the syndicate will not only suffer a huge setback in its plans to charge trucks to use germany 's motorways but may also find itself liable for an enormous bill for revenues in income lost by the government during the debacle . the system outfits every truck with an onboard computer to log its location with satellite signals and report the vehicle 's movements by mobile phone .
but the set up - slated to be the most advanced in europe - has been plagued by technical problems from the start and its launch date has been repeatedly pushed back . the system should have been operational in august 2003 .
delays led to huge losses in income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manfred stolpe the delay in rolling out the road-pricing system has allowed hundreds of thousands of trucks to use germany 's 20,000 kilometers of autobahn free of charge .
the result being that the federal treasury has missed out on € 156 million in revenue per month .
should the government press for toll collect to reimburse its losses , the matter would go to an arbitration board before compensation can be agreed . " one thing remains clear : we need the money , " said the rather exasperated transport minister manfred stolpe after the tuesday morning meeting . if the contract with toll collect had continued until the end of 2004 without a system being established , government losses would have exceeded € 3 billion . toll collect has so far offered to increase the penalties it pays for late performance provided the government agrees to full compensation for outright cancellation of the contract .
so far the syndicate is believed to have invested some € 700 million in the system .
stolpe said that while this particular deal was now on the scrapheap , a new one is likely to only go into effect after a period of two years as it would take a rival company until at least early 2007 to get any of the tried and tested systems into operation . a last chance for toll collect ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : toll collect 's bank computers for truckers .
" we have struggled to find a technically viable and economically satisfactory solution with -lrb- toll collect -rrb- , " stolpe -lrb- photo -rrb- told reporters .
" this was not possible . "
however , stolpe maintained that toll collect still has the possibility to present an improved offer within the next two months which takes into consideration the government 's demands . hundreds of roadside platforms housing cameras and lasers have been built across german highways to photograph every passing vehicle and automatically check if those over 12 tons are paying their tolls .
the system is linked to the u.s. global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- , which enables a moving truck to calculate its exact location down to a few meters , and global-system-for-mobile -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which enable low- cost wireless calls over the whole country .
huge numbers of onboard units have been installed in trucks , but will probably have to be scrapped and replaced .
the system was supposed to be fully automated with bank computers collecting the fees from road users ' accounts " toll collect has not kept to the schedule on many occasions and now the trust in the project is completely destroyed , " explained jochen hövekenmeier , spokesperson of the automobile club of germany in an interview with dw-world even before the contract cancellation was announced . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de big brother on the highway a new toll system goes in effect on german highways for heavy commercial vehicles next month .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "
preventive vaccine better than medicines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one-year-old aids sufferer ncedo masango in swaziland .
experts agree that a preventive vaccine may be the best hope for stopping the spread of the epidemic , now infecting 14,000 people daily , 95 percent of whom live in developing countries .
professor reinhard kurth , president of the berlin-based robert koch institut said , " medical history shows that it can only be a preventive vaccine .
as important as it is that we now have medicines - which , however , are so expensive that they can primarily be used in western europe and north america - it is equally important that medicines don ’ t solve the aids problem , only vaccines can . "
aids : " a medical catastrophe " kurth underlined the urgency in battling aids and stressed it was a moral duty to use german knowledge for aids research .
" aids has developed into the biggest medical catastrophe of our times , at most comparable to the appearance of the pest in europe 650 years ago , " he said .
" we have to effectively combat aids with a vaccine otherwise there ’ s a real danger that the epidemic will really spiral out of control , " he added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de south africa : a muppet for aids awareness the rate of hiv infection among teenagers in south africa has stabilized .

scientists in germany are for the first time preparing to conduct human trials on a new vaccine designed to prevent hiv infection as well as slow the spread of aids in the developing world . in a major boost to the global war on aids , german researchers developing a preventive hiv vaccine said monday they will shortly start testing it on humans .
the clinical human trial , which will take place in germany and belgium , will initially last a year and involve injecting the vaccine into 50 healthy volunteers .
the testing phase is meant to determine the safety of the vaccine and check whether it produces immune responses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in hamburg the trial , backed by the new york-based international aids vaccine initiative -lrb- iavi -rrb- , will be conducted at university clinics in bonn and hamburg as well as at hospitals in brussels and antwerp .
known as tgaac09 , the vaccine targets hiv subtype c , prevalent in south africa , india and china where a substantial amount of the over 40 million aids-infected people live .
no risk of infection during clinical trial the project 's science director , jan van lunzen said on monday in berlin that if the first testing phase proved successful , the second and third phases would be carried out in developing countries .
scientists say that if the vaccine proves effective , it will be available on the market in seven to eight years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientist jan van lunzen lunzen -lrb- photo -rrb- has ruled out that participants in the trial run the risk of getting infected with the hiv virus .
" one can definitely not get infected through this serum because we ’ re using very tiny parts of the virus .
it ’ s also out of the question that the vaccine in itself can cause an infection ; it ’ s primarily about safety and compatibility , " he said .
current vaccine superior to others experts say the present vaccine , which has already been successfully used on monkeys , has several advantages over other vaccines in the development phase .
about 30 vaccines are currently being tested around the world .
as a single-shot vaccine , tgaac09 would not require multiple injections over time as is the case with other vaccines .
a single-shot aids vaccine would be particularly useful for developing countries , where most new hiv infections occur .
because the vaccine is designed to elicit two different types of immune responses , an antibody response and a cell-mediated response , it is potentially very effective .
frans van den boom , european director of iavi said , " with this vaccine you have two arms of the immune system .
the first arm is about creating anti-bodies to the vaccine , and the second arm is that killer cells clear hiv-infected cells , so that ’ s the cellular immunity arm .
the vaccine has the potential to stimulate both arms of the immune system . "

the locals want more economic benefits from the sector tourism is now zanzibar 's biggest industry , easily outstripping the trade in spices , traditionally the island 's biggest foreign currency earner .
the sector has grown rapidly over the last decade attracting investment from around the world , but not everyone is winning , it seems .
standing outside the house of wonders museum in the centre of stone town , the capital of zanzibar , you can see tourists in all directions , shopping at curio stalls , taking guided tours through the historic streets or lingering over cold drinks as they gaze across the azure-coloured indian ocean .
there are also a small group of women from the zanzibar fund for self reliance .
the group aims to boost the incomes of unemployed women by helping them to market their home made products .
foreign funds huda juma nassor is selling children 's clothes as well as cup cakes and chapattis .
she says it is foreigners who benefit most from tourism in zanzibar .

but we zanzibaris live in poverty ... we do n't have enough money to own or manage good hotels , " she said .
" so that 's why i 'm trying to do my business selling from home , but i never see any tourists . "
according to a report by the non-governmental organisation , action aid , despite the rapid growth of tourism on the island , tourism has only benefited big investors and a handful of local people .
janet mawiyoo , the organisation 's director in tanzania , says a lot of foreign companies have bought land and the local people are no longer accessing the sea easily .
" we are aware of a lot of people who work in the tourist industry who are not necessarily from the island .
as to how many local zanzibaris are really benefiting i think that is really questionable , ordinary zanzibaris are really not being part of that scene " said ms mawiyoo .
enclaves of wealth the report contradicts the widely held view that tourism helps to alleviate poverty .
the report says tourism helps only the foreign investors in zanzibar it says that at best , tourism creates enclaves of wealth and development .
but vuai mohammed , the executive secretary of zanzibar 's tourism commission says the benefits are considerable .
" the farmers are benefiting , they sell their crops at a higher price than what they used to do .
the fishermen do the same , " said mr mohammed .
he says most of the development projects like the schools and medical clinics , are being taken care of by the investors who are in the villages .
mr mohammed notes that the people in the villages are being employed and are given priority to buy anything from the hotels .
tourism is relatively new here , and more zanzibaris should become directly involved as the industry grows .
but with the average wage across the island at well below $ 1 a day , it is clear the paradise paid for and enjoyed by tourists is yet to bring benefits to many local people .

the locals want more economic benefits from the sector tourism is now zanzibar 's biggest industry , easily outstripping the trade in spices , traditionally the island 's biggest foreign currency earner .
the sector has grown rapidly over the last decade attracting investment from around the world , but not everyone is winning , it seems .
standing outside the house of wonders museum in the centre of stone town , the capital of zanzibar , you can see tourists in all directions , shopping at curio stalls , taking guided tours through the historic streets or lingering over cold drinks as they gaze across the azure-coloured indian ocean .
there are also a small group of women from the zanzibar fund for self reliance .
the group aims to boost the incomes of unemployed women by helping them to market their home made products .
foreign funds huda juma nassor is selling children 's clothes as well as cup cakes and chapattis .
she says it is foreigners who benefit most from tourism in zanzibar .
the farmers are benefiting , they sell their crops at a higher price than what they used to do - the fishermen do the same vuai mohammed zanzibar tourism commission " there are a lot of italians who own hotels in zanzibar .
but we zanzibaris live in poverty ... we do n't have enough money to own or manage good hotels , " she said .
" so that 's why i 'm trying to do my business selling from home , but i never see any tourists . "
according to a report by the non-governmental organisation , action aid , despite the rapid growth of tourism on the island , tourism has only benefited big investors and a handful of local people .
janet mawiyoo , the organisation 's director in tanzania , says a lot of foreign companies have bought land and the local people are no longer accessing the sea easily .
" we are aware of a lot of people who work in the tourist industry who are not necessarily from the island .
as to how many local zanzibaris are really benefiting i think that is really questionable , ordinary zanzibaris are really not being part of that scene " said ms mawiyoo .
enclaves of wealth the report contradicts the widely held view that tourism helps to alleviate poverty .
the report says tourism helps only the foreign investors in zanzibar it says that at best , tourism creates enclaves of wealth and development .
but vuai mohammed , the executive secretary of zanzibar 's tourism commission says the benefits are considerable .
" the farmers are benefiting , they sell their crops at a higher price than what they used to do .
the fishermen do the same , " said mr mohammed .
he says most of the development projects like the schools and medical clinics , are being taken care of by the investors who are in the villages .
mr mohammed notes that the people in the villages are being employed and are given priority to buy anything from the hotels .
tourism is relatively new here , and more zanzibaris should become directly involved as the industry grows .
but with the average wage across the island at well below $ 1 a day , it is clear the paradise paid for and enjoyed by tourists is yet to bring benefits to many local people .

mr prescott believes the band of land from liverpool to hull is ripe for economic take-off .
meanwhile agencies from the north west , north east and yorkshire are meeting on tuesday to discuss how to unite to improve their economic punch .
the agencies believe a united approach could rival london 's wealth .
the agencies are hoping to devise a joint strategy to break the north 's image of an industrial wasteland compared with the prosperous south .
they are backed by mr prescott who believes the m62 corridor is going to become increasingly important with hull the gateway to the baltic and the markets of the eastern european countries about to join the european union .
' prezzagrad ' " let us look east and west along the corridor , our traditional growth and wealth-creating area , " mr prescott told bbc north west tonight .
according to reports in the sunday times , mr prescott wants to see an extended urban belt along the m62 with spin offs to newcastle and sheffield .
it would be similar to the stretch of land in the usa from boston through new york to washington and has been nicknamed ' prezzagrad ' after the deputy prime minister .
the cities would retain separate names and authorities but are seen as a single economic unit .

for every george michael or dido there are thousands upon thousands of ambitious young people looking for that elusive " break " - a recording contract , or , for most , a steady job .
khadine richards wants to produce records for a living the brit awards , held this week at earls court , london , were a celebration of the best of british popular music .
but this glamorous event also has serious implications for grass-roots music .
every year , around £ 250,000 of the money raised goes towards the brit school , an institution designed to bring on the best of uk talent .
based in croydon , south london , it prepares students aged 14 to 19 for a life in professional showbusiness .
nominations producing , dancing , singing , playing , writing , deal-making : you name it , the brit school covers it .
two of its recent successes - katie melua and amy winehouse , both 19 - were nominated in this year 's awards .
director of music tony castro believes these were the first of many to come .
i see this place as a bit of a greenhouse .
we are the recording industry 's kew gardens tony castro , director of music " i 'm not interested in anything less , " he said .
" we exist to prepare musicians for the highest possible level .
" i see this place as a bit of a greenhouse .
we are the recording industry 's kew gardens . "
katie melua is a student who flowered in the hothouse and has gone on to great success in the real world .
last autumn , she met record producer mike batt while he was on a visit to the school .
he heard katie sing , offered to work with her and they ended up recording an album together - call off the search .
hard work it went to number one last month and has since gone platinum .
the brit school 's principal , nick williams , said : " katie has a fantastic talent .
she was also a good student " it 's wonderful that she 's had this level of recognition .
of course it 's unusual to go so far so quickly , but it is excellent reward for her hard work . "
as part of the btec music course - equivalent to three a-levels - students are exposed to a wide variety of styles , such as jazz and world music .
they learn aspects of recording , including writing , production and editing .
brit nominee katie melua is a high-profile ex-student mr williams said : " the students who come here have to prove they are here to learn for their career .
having music , or dance , or acting as a hobby is not enough .
" we have to treat showbusiness as a vocational subject .
it is what the industry needs .
" we are not looking at producing another pop idol or fame academy : this is the real world . "
variety one student , khadine richards , 16 , wants to work as a record producer .
her btec course takes up around 40 hours a week , while she practises playing the keyboard , saxophone and violin for a further 15 hours or so .
she said : " i listen to all sorts of music .
r 'n'b is my favourite and i think i want to focus on that when i leave .
" the course has given me a lot of variety , so i get to see a lot of different styles . "
her colleague sami sumner , also 16 , added : " i want to try everything .
i 'm not quite sure what i want to do yet , but this should help give me a choice . "
the brit school , with its exposure to new musical experiences , has a buzz about it .
teenagers walk around its glass and wood atrium , animatedly discussing ideas .
sounds emanate from keyboard suites , singing classes and remixing studios .
the sense of stimulation is central to the school 's existence .
students work with industry-standard equipment mr castro said : " it 's hard to make a living in music unless you 're multi-talented and interested in doing lots of things .
" the technology is so advanced these days that anyone can produce a fully professional cd in their bedroom .
" but ideas and new sounds are what really sell .
if you are exposed to lots of different styles , you are more likely to come up with new ideas .
" both katie melua and amy winehouse are examples of students who have benefited from this . "
the brit school is funded by the department for education and skills and the charitable brit trust .
some of the biggest recording labels , including sony and emi , are among its backers .
gigs music stars tom jones and duran duran have visited to discuss the workings of the industry .
the beatles ' producer , sir george martin , designed one of the school 's recording studios .
students perform regular gigs in croydon and record cds of their work .

for every george michael or dido there are thousands upon thousands of ambitious young people looking for that elusive " break " - a recording contract , or , for most , a steady job .
khadine richards wants to produce records for a living the brit awards , held this week at earls court , london , were a celebration of the best of british popular music .
but this glamorous event also has serious implications for grass-roots music .
every year , around £ 250,000 of the money raised goes towards the brit school , an institution designed to bring on the best of uk talent .
based in croydon , south london , it prepares students aged 14 to 19 for a life in professional showbusiness .
nominations producing , dancing , singing , playing , writing , deal-making : you name it , the brit school covers it .
two of its recent successes - katie melua and amy winehouse , both 19 - were nominated in this year 's awards .
director of music tony castro believes these were the first of many to come .
i see this place as a bit of a greenhouse .
we are the recording industry 's kew gardens tony castro , director of music " i 'm not interested in anything less , " he said .
" we exist to prepare musicians for the highest possible level .
" i see this place as a bit of a greenhouse .
we are the recording industry 's kew gardens . "
katie melua is a student who flowered in the hothouse and has gone on to great success in the real world .
last autumn , she met record producer mike batt while he was on a visit to the school .
he heard katie sing , offered to work with her and they ended up recording an album together - call off the search .
hard work it went to number one last month and has since gone platinum .
the brit school 's principal , nick williams , said : " katie has a fantastic talent .
she was also a good student " it 's wonderful that she 's had this level of recognition .
of course it 's unusual to go so far so quickly , but it is excellent reward for her hard work . "
as part of the btec music course - equivalent to three a-levels - students are exposed to a wide variety of styles , such as jazz and world music .
they learn aspects of recording , including writing , production and editing .
brit nominee katie melua is a high-profile ex-student mr williams said : " the students who come here have to prove they are here to learn for their career .
having music , or dance , or acting as a hobby is not enough .
" we have to treat showbusiness as a vocational subject .
it is what the industry needs .
" we are not looking at producing another pop idol or fame academy : this is the real world . "
variety one student , khadine richards , 16 , wants to work as a record producer .
her btec course takes up around 40 hours a week , while she practises playing the keyboard , saxophone and violin for a further 15 hours or so .
she said : " i listen to all sorts of music .
r 'n'b is my favourite and i think i want to focus on that when i leave .
" the course has given me a lot of variety , so i get to see a lot of different styles . "
her colleague sami sumner , also 16 , added : " i want to try everything .
i 'm not quite sure what i want to do yet , but this should help give me a choice . "
the brit school , with its exposure to new musical experiences , has a buzz about it .
teenagers walk around its glass and wood atrium , animatedly discussing ideas .
sounds emanate from keyboard suites , singing classes and remixing studios .
the sense of stimulation is central to the school 's existence .
students work with industry-standard equipment mr castro said : " it 's hard to make a living in music unless you 're multi-talented and interested in doing lots of things .
" the technology is so advanced these days that anyone can produce a fully professional cd in their bedroom .
" but ideas and new sounds are what really sell .
if you are exposed to lots of different styles , you are more likely to come up with new ideas .
" both katie melua and amy winehouse are examples of students who have benefited from this . "
the brit school is funded by the department for education and skills and the charitable brit trust .
some of the biggest recording labels , including sony and emi , are among its backers .
gigs music stars tom jones and duran duran have visited to discuss the workings of the industry .
the beatles ' producer , sir george martin , designed one of the school 's recording studios .
students perform regular gigs in croydon and record cds of their work .
as if the speed of her rise needed emphasis , the latest one contains one of katie melua 's efforts .
the brit school is the only one of england 's 15 city technology colleges with a focus on the arts .

a key meeting this week is to decide on regeneration plans when plans to regenerate one of the most deprived housing estates in the country were unveiled bbc news online talked to residents about their hopes and fears .
now , three years on , hannah goff returns to investigate how it has fared .
in january 2001 , tony blair visited the run-down ocean estate in stepney , east london , and told the community it was getting £ 56m for regeneration .
but the government 's flagship inner city scheme would achieve nothing if the funds were not matched by hard work , the prime minister warned .
turning around such a huge estate , blighted by decaying buildings , drug dealers and crime , would be one of the biggest tests for labour 's new deal programme .
however , things have not started well .
three of the five organisations funded by the ocean new deal for communities -lrb- ndc -rrb- have had their funding suspended because of allegations of fraud or mismanagement .
there are two police investigations into claims of large-scale misuse of public funds at stepney 's youth action scheme -lrb- yas -rrb- and educational project dame colet house .
it 's a disaster ... people are very angry janet ludlow tower hamlets lib dem leader in both cases , auditors rsm robson rhodes said payments had been made to firms and individuals for services that may not have been provided .
and an investigation into allegations of mismanagement , this time by tower hamlets council , is under way into st dunstan 's bengali community resource centre .
the council says while " recent difficulties " are to be regretted , it is important to view the ocean regeneration in the wider context .
but the backbone of the scheme - the plan to renovate the estate 's crumbling and overcrowded housing - is running two years behind schedule .
it still has not been decided exactly which of the estate 's 50 blocks will be demolished and which will be renovated .
under the scheme 's £ 200m housing masterplan 25 of ocean 's worst blocks were to be replaced with new housing .
scaling back but now there appears to be a major scaling back of the housing programme as the ndc team strives to draw up a " minimum sustainable option " .
this could mean as few as 10 of the worst blocks being demolished and rebuilt .
ocean ndc chief executive matin meah , who has been running the project since last october , says : " the masterplan represented the best aspirations of the local community .
" at the moment we are trying to refine that and find a viable and serious proposal .
" even though it is not what was originally promised we hope it will still go far enough to convince people . "
the basic problem is a massive funding gap .
although mr meah would not give specific figures , he acknowledged that of the £ 200m needed to fulfil those aspirations only about £ 47m was certain - £ 20m from tower hamlets council and about £ 27m in capital funding from the ndc .
the scheme 's chosen housing association partner , sanctuary , could raise a significant sum borrowing from the private sector - something that local authorities are not allowed to do .
but for that to happen the tenants of the estate have to vote for the stock to be transferred to the housing association in a ballot next autumn .
the financial black hole has been caused in part by the cost of buying out leaseholders who bought their homes through the right to buy scheme .
disappointment local mp oona king estimated it would cost tower hamlets £ 18.7m alone to compensate the 156 leaseholders on the estate for knocking down their homes .
the chair of the ocean estate tenants and leaseholders association , brenda daley , said : " we knew there was going to be a gap but we did n't know how much .
" it looked nice at the beginning , but now we 've got a lot of money that we have got to find .
" people are going to be very disappointed because of the state that some of the flats are in . "
and mr meah , who is set to discuss the problem with the government office for london , admits some people are fed up .
" there are some frustrations particularly in housing .
people want to see a lot of physical work . "
there are a lot of people going into treatment and we 're working hard to raise awareness zafir ali , drugs outreach worker but , he insists , there is a lot of invisible work going on - the new deal was never only about bricks and mortar .
it was a 10-year plan to regenerate an area blighted by crime , unemployment and poverty and poor educational achievement from the bottom up .
and there have been some real successes in these fields .
a team of eight highly visible wardens patrol the estate , escorting those scared to pick up their pensions or pop out for their shopping .
unlike other areas of tower hamlets , crime rates are actually falling on the ocean estate - once known as the cheapest place in britain to buy heroin .
drugs outreach workers have been tackling some of the estate 's most hardened addicts .
zafar ali has seen five of 24 referrals go through treatment and begin jobs .
he says : " things have actually got a little bit worse than before because there are new dealers arriving on the estate .
" but there are a lot of people going into treatment and we 're working hard to raise awareness . "
one of ocean 's gp surgeries operates out of a converted flat a new healthy living centre is being opened in march to replace two of the most shoddy gp surgery premises in the country .
and a working links scheme has enabled nearly 100 young people to find work over the past year .
but it is in education that ocean has seen its real successes .
tower hamlets is the fastest improving local education authority in the country and educational standards are improving in the ndc area faster than elsewhere in the borough .
according to resident and ndc board member alibor choudhury , it is these " invisible improvements " that are important : " it is n't just a massive housing programme - it 's a comprehensive programme to improve lives .
it has got people involved , " the 30-year-old social researcher said .
" physically people may not see anything but they know something is happening and that improvements are coming " , he added .

it 's a disaster ... people are very angry janet ludlow tower hamlets lib dem leader in both cases , auditors rsm robson rhodes said payments had been made to firms and individuals for services that may not have been provided .
and an investigation into allegations of mismanagement , this time by tower hamlets council , is under way into st dunstan 's bengali community resource centre .
the council says while " recent difficulties " are to be regretted , it is important to view the ocean regeneration in the wider context .
but the backbone of the scheme - the plan to renovate the estate 's crumbling and overcrowded housing - is running two years behind schedule .
it still has not been decided exactly which of the estate 's 50 blocks will be demolished and which will be renovated .
under the scheme 's £ 200m housing masterplan 25 of ocean 's worst blocks were to be replaced with new housing .
scaling back but now there appears to be a major scaling back of the housing programme as the ndc team strives to draw up a " minimum sustainable option " .
this could mean as few as 10 of the worst blocks being demolished and rebuilt .
ocean ndc chief executive matin meah , who has been running the project since last october , says : " the masterplan represented the best aspirations of the local community .
" at the moment we are trying to refine that and find a viable and serious proposal .
" even though it is not what was originally promised we hope it will still go far enough to convince people . "
the basic problem is a massive funding gap .
although mr meah would not give specific figures , he acknowledged that of the £ 200m needed to fulfil those aspirations only about £ 47m was certain - £ 20m from tower hamlets council and about £ 27m in capital funding from the ndc .
the scheme 's chosen housing association partner , sanctuary , could raise a significant sum borrowing from the private sector - something that local authorities are not allowed to do .
but for that to happen the tenants of the estate have to vote for the stock to be transferred to the housing association in a ballot next autumn .
the financial black hole has been caused in part by the cost of buying out leaseholders who bought their homes through the right to buy scheme .
disappointment local mp oona king estimated it would cost tower hamlets £ 18.7m alone to compensate the 156 leaseholders on the estate for knocking down their homes .
the chair of the ocean estate tenants and leaseholders association , brenda daley , said : " we knew there was going to be a gap but we did n't know how much .
" it looked nice at the beginning , but now we 've got a lot of money that we have got to find .
" people are going to be very disappointed because of the state that some of the flats are in . "
and mr meah , who is set to discuss the problem with the government office for london , admits some people are fed up .
" there are some frustrations particularly in housing .
people want to see a lot of physical work . "
there are a lot of people going into treatment and we 're working hard to raise awareness zafir ali , drugs outreach worker but , he insists , there is a lot of invisible work going on - the new deal was never only about bricks and mortar .
it was a 10-year plan to regenerate an area blighted by crime , unemployment and poverty and poor educational achievement from the bottom up .
and there have been some real successes in these fields .
a team of eight highly visible wardens patrol the estate , escorting those scared to pick up their pensions or pop out for their shopping .
unlike other areas of tower hamlets , crime rates are actually falling on the ocean estate - once known as the cheapest place in britain to buy heroin .
drugs outreach workers have been tackling some of the estate 's most hardened addicts .
zafar ali has seen five of 24 referrals go through treatment and begin jobs .
he says : " things have actually got a little bit worse than before because there are new dealers arriving on the estate .
" but there are a lot of people going into treatment and we 're working hard to raise awareness . "
one of ocean 's gp surgeries operates out of a converted flat a new healthy living centre is being opened in march to replace two of the most shoddy gp surgery premises in the country .
and a working links scheme has enabled nearly 100 young people to find work over the past year .
but it is in education that ocean has seen its real successes .
tower hamlets is the fastest improving local education authority in the country and educational standards are improving in the ndc area faster than elsewhere in the borough .
according to resident and ndc board member alibor choudhury , it is these " invisible improvements " that are important : " it is n't just a massive housing programme - it 's a comprehensive programme to improve lives .
it has got people involved , " the 30-year-old social researcher said .
" physically people may not see anything but they know something is happening and that improvements are coming " , he added .

a key meeting this week is to decide on regeneration plans when plans to regenerate one of the most deprived housing estates in the country were unveiled bbc news online talked to residents about their hopes and fears .
now , three years on , hannah goff returns to investigate how it has fared .
in january 2001 , tony blair visited the run-down ocean estate in stepney , east london , and told the community it was getting £ 56m for regeneration .
but the government 's flagship inner city scheme would achieve nothing if the funds were not matched by hard work , the prime minister warned .
turning around such a huge estate , blighted by decaying buildings , drug dealers and crime , would be one of the biggest tests for labour 's new deal programme .
however , things have not started well .
three of the five organisations funded by the ocean new deal for communities -lrb- ndc -rrb- have had their funding suspended because of allegations of fraud or mismanagement .
there are two police investigations into claims of large-scale misuse of public funds at stepney 's youth action scheme -lrb- yas -rrb- and educational project dame colet house .
it 's a disaster ... people are very angry janet ludlow tower hamlets lib dem leader in both cases , auditors rsm robson rhodes said payments had been made to firms and individuals for services that may not have been provided .
and an investigation into allegations of mismanagement , this time by tower hamlets council , is under way into st dunstan 's bengali community resource centre .
the council says while " recent difficulties " are to be regretted , it is important to view the ocean regeneration in the wider context .
but the backbone of the scheme - the plan to renovate the estate 's crumbling and overcrowded housing - is running two years behind schedule .
it still has not been decided exactly which of the estate 's 50 blocks will be demolished and which will be renovated .
under the scheme 's £ 200m housing masterplan 25 of ocean 's worst blocks were to be replaced with new housing .
scaling back but now there appears to be a major scaling back of the housing programme as the ndc team strives to draw up a " minimum sustainable option " .
this could mean as few as 10 of the worst blocks being demolished and rebuilt .
ocean ndc chief executive matin meah , who has been running the project since last october , says : " the masterplan represented the best aspirations of the local community .
" at the moment we are trying to refine that and find a viable and serious proposal .
" even though it is not what was originally promised we hope it will still go far enough to convince people . "
the basic problem is a massive funding gap .
although mr meah would not give specific figures , he acknowledged that of the £ 200m needed to fulfil those aspirations only about £ 47m was certain - £ 20m from tower hamlets council and about £ 27m in capital funding from the ndc .
the scheme 's chosen housing association partner , sanctuary , could raise a significant sum borrowing from the private sector - something that local authorities are not allowed to do .
but for that to happen the tenants of the estate have to vote for the stock to be transferred to the housing association in a ballot next autumn .
the financial black hole has been caused in part by the cost of buying out leaseholders who bought their homes through the right to buy scheme .
disappointment local mp oona king estimated it would cost tower hamlets £ 18.7m alone to compensate the 156 leaseholders on the estate for knocking down their homes .
the chair of the ocean estate tenants and leaseholders association , brenda daley , said : " we knew there was going to be a gap but we did n't know how much .
" it looked nice at the beginning , but now we 've got a lot of money that we have got to find .
" people are going to be very disappointed because of the state that some of the flats are in . "
and mr meah , who is set to discuss the problem with the government office for london , admits some people are fed up .
" there are some frustrations particularly in housing .
people want to see a lot of physical work . "
there are a lot of people going into treatment and we 're working hard to raise awareness zafir ali , drugs outreach worker but , he insists , there is a lot of invisible work going on - the new deal was never only about bricks and mortar .
it was a 10-year plan to regenerate an area blighted by crime , unemployment and poverty and poor educational achievement from the bottom up .
and there have been some real successes in these fields .
a team of eight highly visible wardens patrol the estate , escorting those scared to pick up their pensions or pop out for their shopping .
unlike other areas of tower hamlets , crime rates are actually falling on the ocean estate - once known as the cheapest place in britain to buy heroin .

he says : " things have actually got a little bit worse than before because there are new dealers arriving on the estate .

but it is not a project designed to find innovative and fun uses for the strange platformed scooters .
the coral research group at carnegie mellon university is preparing to hold the first ever football match in which mixed teams of humans and robots play against each other , all on segways .
the game , which kicks off in march , will be the first time robots and humans will have taken part in a task in which they are peers and on an equal " footing " , says professor manuela veloso , coral group leader .
during the match , robots and humans will play on the same side against another team , in a bid to understand how well they can work together .
" this is really something new .
it is not about commanding robots , as it usually is , so this is very interesting , " professor veloso told bbc news online .
game of two halves the robots are not quite to the standard of david beckham yet .
but they and the researchers are learning from their experiences of aibo football .
the segways have been donated to the team by the manufacturers , and using pentagon funds , they built the basic robot onto the cut-down scooters .
coral fitted out the robotic segways with cameras which can locate brightly-coloured objects , and developed a kicking device controlled by an on-board computer .
" the reason we used segways is that they are very robust in terms of motion .
robots on wheels are very hard to make , going uphill can be difficult , " said professor veloso .
" the mechanical platform has a balance mode , so it makes it interesting to use as a motion platform . "
the robots have been programmed with a learning-based software , mobile autonomous robot software -lrb- mars -rrb- , which has been developed by the pentagon 's defense advanced research projects agency -lrb- darpa -rrb- .
both humans and robots have the same acceleration , speed , turning capability and will use the same type of kicking device .
" we constantly have segways kicking balls everywhere .
we have got to the stage where they can see the ball , follow it well , and it can kick it well .
but it can not aim very well yet , " said the professor .
" so now we want to more on the intelligence side and get the robot to think about where it can go and where it can kick it , on the strategic ai level . "
robotic daily life robots and humans balancing on specially-adapted segways sounds like a fun kick-around , but the research has some serious applications .
ultimately , the experiments could help scientists understand more about how ai robots and humans can work in teams , communicate and collaborate .
the results could translate into being able to use robots and humans effectively in tasks that require them to work in teams , in search and rescue operations , as part of construction crews or in space exploration .
" my research has all been about having the robots handle tasks in a teamwork scenario .
robot soccer has been an excuse for needing a team , and it is a challenge because of the presence of opponents , " said professor veloso .
" in a soccer match , you have to make a decision in real-time because the ball is coming in front of you and you have to pass . "
having worked with robots all her professional life , she is passionate about them and committed to changing the prevailing perception that they are just programmable chunks of metal with chips for brains .
currently , robots are very often deployed as human replacements , doing jobs in environments which are unsuitable for people , in deep space or deep under the sea .
" my passion , " explained professor veloso , " is bringing robots into daily life , rather than sending them into space . "
" and maybe 10 years from now , we will understand more about how humans will relate to artificial life . "

the match will be the first of its kind but it is not a project designed to find innovative and fun uses for the strange platformed scooters .
the coral research group at carnegie mellon university is preparing to hold the first ever football match in which mixed teams of humans and robots play against each other , all on segways .
the game , which kicks off in march , will be the first time robots and humans will have taken part in a task in which they are peers and on an equal " footing " , says professor manuela veloso , coral group leader .
during the match , robots and humans will play on the same side against another team , in a bid to understand how well they can work together .
" this is really something new .
it is not about commanding robots , as it usually is , so this is very interesting , " professor veloso told bbc news online .
game of two halves the robots are not quite to the standard of david beckham yet .
but they and the researchers are learning from their experiences of aibo football .
the segways have been donated to the team by the manufacturers , and using pentagon funds , they built the basic robot onto the cut-down scooters .
robotic segway is good at seeing and kicking the ball coral fitted out the robotic segways with cameras which can locate brightly-coloured objects , and developed a kicking device controlled by an on-board computer .
" the reason we used segways is that they are very robust in terms of motion .
robots on wheels are very hard to make , going uphill can be difficult , " said professor veloso .
" the mechanical platform has a balance mode , so it makes it interesting to use as a motion platform . "
the robots have been programmed with a learning-based software , mobile autonomous robot software -lrb- mars -rrb- , which has been developed by the pentagon 's defense advanced research projects agency -lrb- darpa -rrb- .
both humans and robots have the same acceleration , speed , turning capability and will use the same type of kicking device .
" we constantly have segways kicking balls everywhere .
we have got to the stage where they can see the ball , follow it well , and it can kick it well .
but it can not aim very well yet , " said the professor .
" so now we want to more on the intelligence side and get the robot to think about where it can go and where it can kick it , on the strategic ai level . "
robotic daily life robots and humans balancing on specially-adapted segways sounds like a fun kick-around , but the research has some serious applications .
ultimately , the experiments could help scientists understand more about how ai robots and humans can work in teams , communicate and collaborate .
not a replay : what the robotic segways see the results could translate into being able to use robots and humans effectively in tasks that require them to work in teams , in search and rescue operations , as part of construction crews or in space exploration .
" my research has all been about having the robots handle tasks in a teamwork scenario .
robot soccer has been an excuse for needing a team , and it is a challenge because of the presence of opponents , " said professor veloso .
" in a soccer match , you have to make a decision in real-time because the ball is coming in front of you and you have to pass . "
having worked with robots all her professional life , she is passionate about them and committed to changing the prevailing perception that they are just programmable chunks of metal with chips for brains .
currently , robots are very often deployed as human replacements , doing jobs in environments which are unsuitable for people , in deep space or deep under the sea .

the match will be the first of its kind but it is not a project designed to find innovative and fun uses for the strange platformed scooters .
the coral research group at carnegie mellon university is preparing to hold the first ever football match in which mixed teams of humans and robots play against each other , all on segways .
the game , which kicks off in march , will be the first time robots and humans will have taken part in a task in which they are peers and on an equal " footing " , says professor manuela veloso , coral group leader .
during the match , robots and humans will play on the same side against another team , in a bid to understand how well they can work together .
" this is really something new .
it is not about commanding robots , as it usually is , so this is very interesting , " professor veloso told bbc news online .
game of two halves the robots are not quite to the standard of david beckham yet .
but they and the researchers are learning from their experiences of aibo football .
the segways have been donated to the team by the manufacturers , and using pentagon funds , they built the basic robot onto the cut-down scooters .
robotic segway is good at seeing and kicking the ball coral fitted out the robotic segways with cameras which can locate brightly-coloured objects , and developed a kicking device controlled by an on-board computer .
" the reason we used segways is that they are very robust in terms of motion .
robots on wheels are very hard to make , going uphill can be difficult , " said professor veloso .
" the mechanical platform has a balance mode , so it makes it interesting to use as a motion platform . "
the robots have been programmed with a learning-based software , mobile autonomous robot software -lrb- mars -rrb- , which has been developed by the pentagon 's defense advanced research projects agency -lrb- darpa -rrb- .
both humans and robots have the same acceleration , speed , turning capability and will use the same type of kicking device .
" we constantly have segways kicking balls everywhere .
we have got to the stage where they can see the ball , follow it well , and it can kick it well .
but it can not aim very well yet , " said the professor .
" so now we want to more on the intelligence side and get the robot to think about where it can go and where it can kick it , on the strategic ai level . "
robotic daily life robots and humans balancing on specially-adapted segways sounds like a fun kick-around , but the research has some serious applications .
ultimately , the experiments could help scientists understand more about how ai robots and humans can work in teams , communicate and collaborate .
not a replay : what the robotic segways see the results could translate into being able to use robots and humans effectively in tasks that require them to work in teams , in search and rescue operations , as part of construction crews or in space exploration .
" my research has all been about having the robots handle tasks in a teamwork scenario .
robot soccer has been an excuse for needing a team , and it is a challenge because of the presence of opponents , " said professor veloso .
" in a soccer match , you have to make a decision in real-time because the ball is coming in front of you and you have to pass . "
having worked with robots all her professional life , she is passionate about them and committed to changing the prevailing perception that they are just programmable chunks of metal with chips for brains .
currently , robots are very often deployed as human replacements , doing jobs in environments which are unsuitable for people , in deep space or deep under the sea .

as a victory lap , the determined 23-year-old took her single all this time to the top of the chart and held it there for three weeks .
her soulful singing defeated one skinny wannabe after another , and the series final saw michelle win the majority of 10.2 million public votes plus a recording contract .
the wannabes have had the last laugh , though , because youthful mcmanus has been saddled with a very middle-aged album .
as its valentine 's card title suggests , the meaning of love is based around a single concept - the ballad .
all 14 songs follow the slow , well-worn path to a climactic key change then vanish , leaving barely an echo .
restrained acclaimed pop writer cathy dennis contributes , but the mawkish one life and when the world is not enough prove far less addictive than ca n't get you out of my head or toxic .
mcmanus has proved she can sing rings around traditional pop stars , yet she will need better material to become a will young rather than a david sneddon .
the spirited singer is barely given a chance to let rip , her vocals sounding muffled and restrained by pedestrian production .
admirably , the album contains only one cover version ; but this new version of feeling good is a pale shadow of her powerful television rendition .
the meaning of love is dull enough to take the shine off michelle mcmanus .
hopefully the fickle pop world will give her the chance to restore it .
a selection of your reviews are below .
i think this album shows what she can do .. which , to be fair , is not a lot .
i still believe she got the sympathy vote , and now maybe the public will realise they made the wrong choice voting for her .
she 's not a pop idol - even her music proves that .
cheryl , guildford , surrey so she 's the one that sings that song ?
i thought it was atomic kitten or someone like that !
i hope she endures past the fad of being of a heavy build and a singer , i imagine old ladies and the very young will buy her songs -lrb- hey it 's kept cliff richard at the top for 40 years ! -rrb- .
ian , milton keynes , uk she can sing and size never stopped alison moyet or countless american black soul divas but she does need better material .
darren , london , uk it 's a shame really , there were some good people on pop idol .
never mind .
gareth and will , you will not be knocked off your podium just yet .
ronnie , liverpool i missed every single episode of pop trash deliberately but heard about michelle and thought she had to have a fabulous singing voice to get over what she looks like .
this was a contest to find a pop idol after all !
had been listening to a fantastic voice on the radio for weeks and thought it must have been michelle but i was actually listening to joss stone !
finally heard michelle 's effort last week ... so how bad were the rest ?
if you want to listen to a real live pop idol buy the soul session - joss stone is the real thing !
nettie , cambridge uk the songs that i have heard to date are bland and do not leave any lasting impression .
there must be people buying the record , but i ca n't imagine who .
the record 's ' success ' so far has stemmed from the hype of the show together with the usual in-your-face marketing , over-exposure and definitely not from the terrible songs and mcmanus 's local pub 'esque performances on saturday morning kids tv .
pete , bristol , uk i think michelle is a great example to every one who has been made inferior because of weight issues -lrb- which incidentally are only issues to thin people generally -rrb- .
her album may not be the best recording ever and i doubt britney and christina are quaking in their boots , but good luck to her ! ! !
catherine , leeds , uk it 's a shame for michelle mcmanus , she can sing , but she is n't a pop " idol " .
martin poulton , manchester , england what more can you expect from yet another manufactured , shrink-wrapped , mass-marketed pop droid ?
snore .
mark , london michelle 's first album was going to be her next hurdle in her musical career after winning pop idol .
her fans voted for her because she showed spirit and sang with such energy .
the album sadly does n't let michelle 's true talent shine through with the soppy ballads that have been chosen for her .
emma jones , huntingdon , cambs surely it must be time for pop idol to end ?
the main fault in the format is that while it 's an addictive and compelling show - love it or hate it - the music it subsequently produces is cheaply produced , soul-less pop that barely ever develops the talent of the singers .
sadly , michelle 's album is another case in point .
steve , uk , lincoln , uk michelle mcmanus may be young , but she looks older then her years , and that 's why these types of songs have been chosen for her .
everybody should just be honest and admit that she is n't " pop star " material .
this will be her first and last album .
janice spence , uk one of the over riding problems of produced product is its lack of life .
we teach these people to compress dynamics then do it again with an electronic compressor so everything that endeared us to the performance in the first place is flushed away .
i blame the useless producers !
this album is n't bad but it could have been so much better .
sorry michelle , its the same old british problem .
dave , chatham , kent .

michelle is a good singer and i do n't believe she got the sympathy vote as proved three weeks at number one .
i am afraid that this country has a very jealous attitude when it comes to being successful .
how sad that we have this build em up and knock them down attitude .
david welham , colchester , england pop music and the charts are like jelly .
it 's really for the undeveloped palate and you really should grow out of it by the time you reach 12 .
i ca n't believe grown people even think it 's worthy of debate .
gerald greenwood , london , uk i watched pop idol all the way through and i never thought that michelle was that good .
her voice is very nasal -lrb- as nicki pointed out on the show -rrb- and soon gets quite annoying .
sadly , listening to a whole album confirms this feeling .
i guess it 's good that she won , but where can she possibly go from here ?
clearly , her managers / producers have launched her into pop-oblivion with the choice of songs on the album .
as a final thought , looking at the official website , anyone can see how much the record company takes her seriously .
it 's just a few pages , with everything else described as coming soon .
that ca n't be a good song , so long after she won the show .
steve jones , billericay , uk have n't heard the album but surely that song is ironic ?
" all this time , i 've come a long long way . "
has n't she just walked into a career after being on tv for a while ?
and , " the future 's looking bright " - is someone having a laugh at her expense ?
mike , peterborough , uk i love michelle .
i think she is the best singer ever and i voted for her to win pop idol several times .
keep up the good work michelle !
martin bundy , southampton , uk it must be a joke or i would n't be laughing so hard .

martin bundy , southampton , uk it must be a joke or i would n't be laughing so hard .

as a victory lap , the determined 23-year-old took her single all this time to the top of the chart and held it there for three weeks .
her soulful singing defeated one skinny wannabe after another , and the series final saw michelle win the majority of 10.2 million public votes plus a recording contract .
the wannabes have had the last laugh , though , because youthful mcmanus has been saddled with a very middle-aged album .
as its valentine 's card title suggests , the meaning of love is based around a single concept - the ballad .
all 14 songs follow the slow , well-worn path to a climactic key change then vanish , leaving barely an echo .
restrained acclaimed pop writer cathy dennis contributes , but the mawkish one life and when the world is not enough prove far less addictive than ca n't get you out of my head or toxic .
mcmanus has proved she can sing rings around traditional pop stars , yet she will need better material to become a will young rather than a david sneddon .
the spirited singer is barely given a chance to let rip , her vocals sounding muffled and restrained by pedestrian production .
admirably , the album contains only one cover version ; but this new version of feeling good is a pale shadow of her powerful television rendition .
the meaning of love is dull enough to take the shine off michelle mcmanus .
hopefully the fickle pop world will give her the chance to restore it .
a selection of your reviews are below .
i think this album shows what she can do .. which , to be fair , is not a lot .
i still believe she got the sympathy vote , and now maybe the public will realise they made the wrong choice voting for her .
she 's not a pop idol - even her music proves that .
cheryl , guildford , surrey so she 's the one that sings that song ?
i thought it was atomic kitten or someone like that !
i hope she endures past the fad of being of a heavy build and a singer , i imagine old ladies and the very young will buy her songs -lrb- hey it 's kept cliff richard at the top for 40 years ! -rrb- .
ian , milton keynes , uk she can sing and size never stopped alison moyet or countless american black soul divas but she does need better material .
darren , london , uk it 's a shame really , there were some good people on pop idol .
never mind .
gareth and will , you will not be knocked off your podium just yet .
ronnie , liverpool i missed every single episode of pop trash deliberately but heard about michelle and thought she had to have a fabulous singing voice to get over what she looks like .
this was a contest to find a pop idol after all !
had been listening to a fantastic voice on the radio for weeks and thought it must have been michelle but i was actually listening to joss stone !
finally heard michelle 's effort last week ... so how bad were the rest ?
if you want to listen to a real live pop idol buy the soul session - joss stone is the real thing !
nettie , cambridge uk the songs that i have heard to date are bland and do not leave any lasting impression .
there must be people buying the record , but i ca n't imagine who .
the record 's ' success ' so far has stemmed from the hype of the show together with the usual in-your-face marketing , over-exposure and definitely not from the terrible songs and mcmanus 's local pub 'esque performances on saturday morning kids tv .
pete , bristol , uk i think michelle is a great example to every one who has been made inferior because of weight issues -lrb- which incidentally are only issues to thin people generally -rrb- .
her album may not be the best recording ever and i doubt britney and christina are quaking in their boots , but good luck to her ! ! !
catherine , leeds , uk it 's a shame for michelle mcmanus , she can sing , but she is n't a pop " idol " .
martin poulton , manchester , england what more can you expect from yet another manufactured , shrink-wrapped , mass-marketed pop droid ?
snore .
mark , london michelle 's first album was going to be her next hurdle in her musical career after winning pop idol .
her fans voted for her because she showed spirit and sang with such energy .
the album sadly does n't let michelle 's true talent shine through with the soppy ballads that have been chosen for her .
emma jones , huntingdon , cambs surely it must be time for pop idol to end ?
the main fault in the format is that while it 's an addictive and compelling show - love it or hate it - the music it subsequently produces is cheaply produced , soul-less pop that barely ever develops the talent of the singers .
sadly , michelle 's album is another case in point .
steve , uk , lincoln , uk michelle mcmanus may be young , but she looks older then her years , and that 's why these types of songs have been chosen for her .
everybody should just be honest and admit that she is n't " pop star " material .
this will be her first and last album .
janice spence , uk one of the over riding problems of produced product is its lack of life .
we teach these people to compress dynamics then do it again with an electronic compressor so everything that endeared us to the performance in the first place is flushed away .
i blame the useless producers !
this album is n't bad but it could have been so much better .
sorry michelle , its the same old british problem .
dave , chatham , kent .
uk to all these people who are rude , obnoxious .
michelle is a good singer and i do n't believe she got the sympathy vote as proved three weeks at number one .
i am afraid that this country has a very jealous attitude when it comes to being successful .
how sad that we have this build em up and knock them down attitude .
david welham , colchester , england pop music and the charts are like jelly .
it 's really for the undeveloped palate and you really should grow out of it by the time you reach 12 .
i ca n't believe grown people even think it 's worthy of debate .
gerald greenwood , london , uk i watched pop idol all the way through and i never thought that michelle was that good .
her voice is very nasal -lrb- as nicki pointed out on the show -rrb- and soon gets quite annoying .
sadly , listening to a whole album confirms this feeling .
i guess it 's good that she won , but where can she possibly go from here ?
clearly , her managers / producers have launched her into pop-oblivion with the choice of songs on the album .
as a final thought , looking at the official website , anyone can see how much the record company takes her seriously .
it 's just a few pages , with everything else described as coming soon .
that ca n't be a good song , so long after she won the show .
steve jones , billericay , uk have n't heard the album but surely that song is ironic ?
" all this time , i 've come a long long way . "
has n't she just walked into a career after being on tv for a while ?
and , " the future 's looking bright " - is someone having a laugh at her expense ?
mike , peterborough , uk i love michelle .
i think she is the best singer ever and i voted for her to win pop idol several times .
keep up the good work michelle !
martin bundy , southampton , uk it must be a joke or i would n't be laughing so hard .
she can sing on key , but the songs are rubbish and her voice feels like my head is being held in a vice !
that poor girl .
someone needs to tell her not to quit her day job .
