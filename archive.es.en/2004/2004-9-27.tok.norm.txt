addressing the controversial claims made by ethnic germans to reclaim the land they lost when they were expelled at the end of wwii , the two leaders said that joint efforts would be made to prevent the situation from deepening the rift polish-german relations .

" it should be clear to anyone that restitution claims won ’ t lead anywhere , but will only poison relations between our two nations . ” the polish prime minister also rejected the resolution passed by the polish parliament , the sejm , earlier this month calling for germans to pay damages for the nazi occupation of their country .
he said that the issue had been dealt with at length in the past , and was settled once and for all . " calling for fresh negotiations on this matter does not only harm our bilateral relations , but relations between poland and the european union as a whole , ” belka added . claims and counter-claims the fresh debate about reparations claims was triggered some weeks ago by a small group representing an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans who were expelled or fled from present-day poland when germany 's borders shifted at the end of world war ii .
the group has threatened to take their claims to polish and european courts in a bid to receive restitution for ancestral property . in response , the polish parliament adopted a resolution calling for reparations for " the enormous material and spiritual destruction caused by german aggression , occupation , and genocide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 27.09.2004 leaders ' victories keep it tight at the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl 's goal for stuttgart kept the heat on leaders wolfsburg week six saw a number of the top teams make a break from the pack with wins for leaders wolfsburg , second placed stuttgart , champions werder bremen and bayern munich .
here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .
the previously free scoring bayer players had no response and slip further off the pace into sixth . bayern gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy does it again .
bayern munich continue their ominous creeping run up the table with another victory , this time a 3-1 win over sc freiburg in the olympic stadium .
bayern moved up to fourth but again failed to show everything they are capable , relying once more on the outstanding dutch striker roy makaay who scored one goal and set up another .
but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .
reigning champions werder bremen continue to ease themselves back into contention and saturday 's 4-1 win away at bochum confirmed their intention not give up their title so easily after a run of indifferent results .
a hat-trick in 19 minutes by substitute striker miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- and close range effort from midfielder tim borowski enabled bremen to hang onto third place while inflicting bochum 's first defeat of the season .
slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .
di salvo reduced the arrears from close range in the 52nd minute and equalized seven minutes later with a volley from inside the box . nuremburg and arminia bielefeld , two of the promoted sides , battled it out for three hard won points with bielefeld the victors in a 2-1 away win .
a header on 18 minutes from striker fatmir vata put the visitors ahead and bielefeld increased their lead through midfielder patrick owomoyela on 64 minutes . bielefeld wins battle of promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : substitute stefan kiessling pulled one back for the home side with a header in the 76th minute but it was not enough for nuremburg who have seen their early stable form desert them of late .
nuremburg drop to 10th while bielefeld move up to 16th . bundesliga newcomers mainz continued their strong start by sharing the points with borussia dortmund courtesy of striker benjamin auer , who equalized in the 56th minute before a club record 20,300 crowd in the 1-1 draw on sunday .
jan koller had opened the scoring on nine minutes for dortmund .
more squandered points mean that bvb now sit eight points off the pace in seventh while mainz keep the leaders in sight , sitting two places ahead in fifth . toppmöller thanks takahara bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller .
hamburg coach klaus toppmöller can thank a first bundesliga double by japan striker naohiro takahara for the three points on sunday and may also like to offer his gratitude for keeping him in employment .
hamburg 's dismal season to date looked to have consigned toppmöller to the dole queue but the 2-1 win over hertha berlin may have saved his job . takahara headed the home side in front on three minutes before scoring the winner 10 minutes from time , lifting his team up to 13th place .
berlin midfielder christian müller had leveled in the 12th minute but it was all in vain .
berlin are fourth from bottom and are the only side without victory after six games . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart sends leverkusen spiraling since outclassing real madrid in the champion 's league two weeks ago , bayer leverkusen has been a shadow of its former self .

" the resolution , which was put forward by right-wing parties , flew in the face of warnings from polish president aleksander kwasniewski that it could harm relations between germany and its eastern neighbours who joined the european union in may . belka said on friday that in his first official visit to berlin , he would use talks with chancellor gerhard schröder to " attempt to reach a common position on the issue of reparations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 27.09.2004 leaders ' victories keep it tight at the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl 's goal for stuttgart kept the heat on leaders wolfsburg week six saw a number of the top teams make a break from the pack with wins for leaders wolfsburg , second placed stuttgart , champions werder bremen and bayern munich .
here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .
the previously free scoring bayer players had no response and slip further off the pace into sixth . bayern gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy does it again .
bayern munich continue their ominous creeping run up the table with another victory , this time a 3-1 win over sc freiburg in the olympic stadium .
bayern moved up to fourth but again failed to show everything they are capable , relying once more on the outstanding dutch striker roy makaay who scored one goal and set up another .
but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .
reigning champions werder bremen continue to ease themselves back into contention and saturday 's 4-1 win away at bochum confirmed their intention not give up their title so easily after a run of indifferent results .
a hat-trick in 19 minutes by substitute striker miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- and close range effort from midfielder tim borowski enabled bremen to hang onto third place while inflicting bochum 's first defeat of the season .
slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .
di salvo reduced the arrears from close range in the 52nd minute and equalized seven minutes later with a volley from inside the box . nuremburg and arminia bielefeld , two of the promoted sides , battled it out for three hard won points with bielefeld the victors in a 2-1 away win .
a header on 18 minutes from striker fatmir vata put the visitors ahead and bielefeld increased their lead through midfielder patrick owomoyela on 64 minutes . bielefeld wins battle of promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : substitute stefan kiessling pulled one back for the home side with a header in the 76th minute but it was not enough for nuremburg who have seen their early stable form desert them of late .

wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .

" although there is no international agreement on 100 percent multilateral debt relief , britain will do more , " brown said .
" we will pay our share of the multilateral debt repayments of reforming low-income countries , " he said . " we will make payments in their stead to the world bank and african development bank for the portion that relates to britain 's share of this debt , " the chancellor added .
" we do this alone today but i urge other countries to follow so that indebted countries are relieved of the burden of servicing all unpayable multilateral debt .

" the resolution , which was put forward by right-wing parties , flew in the face of warnings from polish president aleksander kwasniewski that it could harm relations between germany and its eastern neighbours who joined the european union in may . belka said on friday that in his first official visit to berlin , he would use talks with chancellor gerhard schröder to " attempt to reach a common position on the issue of reparations . " he added that there was little point in poland raising the issue of reparations with germany because the demands are unrealistic . polish resolution " indefensible " schröder has dismissed the polish parliament 's resolution as indefensible . " i believe the call is untenable and also impossible to fulfill and the polish government knows that , " he said in a newspaper interview published thursday . although the polish government has announced that it is opposed in principle to demanding compensation from germany , it has said it will evaluate the extent of poland 's losses due to world war ii . and the fact that the resolution was passed by 320 votes to none with one abstention and that a recent opinion poll showed nearly two-thirds of poles supported the move , illustrates the strength of feeling over the issue and makes it one the warsaw government can not ignore . foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz recalled this week that poland had renounced seeking reparations from germany while under soviet rule in 1953 . a total of six million poles , including the majority of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after adolf hitler 's army invaded in 1939 . strained bilateral relations another 2.5 million were deported to labour camps in germany , while warsaw and other cities were nearly destroyed as the nazis sought to eradicate polish culture . relations between the two countries have also been strained by the claims of germans who demand compensation for being forced to leave territory handed over to poland at the end of world war ii . an analyst on polish-german affairs , dorota dakowska from the berlin-based marc bloch centre , said it was these claims which angered many poles who perceive that the ethnic germans " are trying to turn history on its head , by presenting themselves as the biggest victims of war after the jews . " " the loss of homes is disproportionate compared with the death of six million poles , including three million jews , " she said . belka will spend three hours in berlin before returning to warsaw . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

" i believe the call is untenable and also impossible to fulfill and the polish government knows that , " he said in a newspaper interview published thursday . although the polish government has announced that it is opposed in principle to demanding compensation from germany , it has said it will evaluate the extent of poland 's losses due to world war ii . and the fact that the resolution was passed by 320 votes to none with one abstention and that a recent opinion poll showed nearly two-thirds of poles supported the move , illustrates the strength of feeling over the issue and makes it one the warsaw government can not ignore . foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz recalled this week that poland had renounced seeking reparations from germany while under soviet rule in 1953 . a total of six million poles , including the majority of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after adolf hitler 's army invaded in 1939 . strained bilateral relations another 2.5 million were deported to labour camps in germany , while warsaw and other cities were nearly destroyed as the nazis sought to eradicate polish culture . relations between the two countries have also been strained by the claims of germans who demand compensation for being forced to leave territory handed over to poland at the end of world war ii . an analyst on polish-german affairs , dorota dakowska from the berlin-based marc bloch centre , said it was these claims which angered many poles who perceive that the ethnic germans " are trying to turn history on its head , by presenting themselves as the biggest victims of war after the jews . " " the loss of homes is disproportionate compared with the death of six million poles , including three million jews , " she said . belka will spend three hours in berlin before returning to warsaw . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

addressing the controversial claims made by ethnic germans to reclaim the land they lost when they were expelled at the end of wwii , the two leaders said that joint efforts would be made to prevent the situation from deepening the rift polish-german relations .

" calling for fresh negotiations on this matter does not only harm our bilateral relations , but relations between poland and the european union as a whole , ” belka added . claims and counter-claims the fresh debate about reparations claims was triggered some weeks ago by a small group representing an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans who were expelled or fled from present-day poland when germany 's borders shifted at the end of world war ii .
the group has threatened to take their claims to polish and european courts in a bid to receive restitution for ancestral property . in response , the polish parliament adopted a resolution calling for reparations for " the enormous material and spiritual destruction caused by german aggression , occupation , and genocide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 27.09.2004 leaders ' victories keep it tight at the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl 's goal for stuttgart kept the heat on leaders wolfsburg week six saw a number of the top teams make a break from the pack with wins for leaders wolfsburg , second placed stuttgart , champions werder bremen and bayern munich .
here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .
the previously free scoring bayer players had no response and slip further off the pace into sixth . bayern gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy does it again .
bayern munich continue their ominous creeping run up the table with another victory , this time a 3-1 win over sc freiburg in the olympic stadium .
bayern moved up to fourth but again failed to show everything they are capable , relying once more on the outstanding dutch striker roy makaay who scored one goal and set up another .
but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .
reigning champions werder bremen continue to ease themselves back into contention and saturday 's 4-1 win away at bochum confirmed their intention not give up their title so easily after a run of indifferent results .
a hat-trick in 19 minutes by substitute striker miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- and close range effort from midfielder tim borowski enabled bremen to hang onto third place while inflicting bochum 's first defeat of the season .
slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .
di salvo reduced the arrears from close range in the 52nd minute and equalized seven minutes later with a volley from inside the box . nuremburg and arminia bielefeld , two of the promoted sides , battled it out for three hard won points with bielefeld the victors in a 2-1 away win .
a header on 18 minutes from striker fatmir vata put the visitors ahead and bielefeld increased their lead through midfielder patrick owomoyela on 64 minutes . bielefeld wins battle of promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : substitute stefan kiessling pulled one back for the home side with a header in the 76th minute but it was not enough for nuremburg who have seen their early stable form desert them of late .
nuremburg drop to 10th while bielefeld move up to 16th . bundesliga newcomers mainz continued their strong start by sharing the points with borussia dortmund courtesy of striker benjamin auer , who equalized in the 56th minute before a club record 20,300 crowd in the 1-1 draw on sunday .
jan koller had opened the scoring on nine minutes for dortmund .
more squandered points mean that bvb now sit eight points off the pace in seventh while mainz keep the leaders in sight , sitting two places ahead in fifth . toppmöller thanks takahara bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller .
hamburg coach klaus toppmöller can thank a first bundesliga double by japan striker naohiro takahara for the three points on sunday and may also like to offer his gratitude for keeping him in employment .
hamburg 's dismal season to date looked to have consigned toppmöller to the dole queue but the 2-1 win over hertha berlin may have saved his job . takahara headed the home side in front on three minutes before scoring the winner 10 minutes from time , lifting his team up to 13th place .
berlin midfielder christian müller had leveled in the 12th minute but it was all in vain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.09.2004 turkey adopts key eu reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes it will be one of the stars on the eu flag turkish parliament on sunday for passed a crucial package of reforms aimed at boosting the country 's chances for starting membership talks with the european union . ankara took the unusual step of calling for an urgent parliamentary session on sunday to quickly pass a penal code reform package ahead of a crucial eu commission progress report to be issued oct .
6 .
both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes to become a full-fledged member of the eu eu officials have indicated that the bloc 's report is likely to recommend beginning the talks .
but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .

both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .

erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .

despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .

here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .
the previously free scoring bayer players had no response and slip further off the pace into sixth . bayern gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy does it again .
bayern munich continue their ominous creeping run up the table with another victory , this time a 3-1 win over sc freiburg in the olympic stadium .
bayern moved up to fourth but again failed to show everything they are capable , relying once more on the outstanding dutch striker roy makaay who scored one goal and set up another .
but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .
reigning champions werder bremen continue to ease themselves back into contention and saturday 's 4-1 win away at bochum confirmed their intention not give up their title so easily after a run of indifferent results .
a hat-trick in 19 minutes by substitute striker miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- and close range effort from midfielder tim borowski enabled bremen to hang onto third place while inflicting bochum 's first defeat of the season .
slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .
di salvo reduced the arrears from close range in the 52nd minute and equalized seven minutes later with a volley from inside the box . nuremburg and arminia bielefeld , two of the promoted sides , battled it out for three hard won points with bielefeld the victors in a 2-1 away win .
a header on 18 minutes from striker fatmir vata put the visitors ahead and bielefeld increased their lead through midfielder patrick owomoyela on 64 minutes . bielefeld wins battle of promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : substitute stefan kiessling pulled one back for the home side with a header in the 76th minute but it was not enough for nuremburg who have seen their early stable form desert them of late .
nuremburg drop to 10th while bielefeld move up to 16th . bundesliga newcomers mainz continued their strong start by sharing the points with borussia dortmund courtesy of striker benjamin auer , who equalized in the 56th minute before a club record 20,300 crowd in the 1-1 draw on sunday .
jan koller had opened the scoring on nine minutes for dortmund .
more squandered points mean that bvb now sit eight points off the pace in seventh while mainz keep the leaders in sight , sitting two places ahead in fifth . toppmöller thanks takahara bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller .
hamburg coach klaus toppmöller can thank a first bundesliga double by japan striker naohiro takahara for the three points on sunday and may also like to offer his gratitude for keeping him in employment .
hamburg 's dismal season to date looked to have consigned toppmöller to the dole queue but the 2-1 win over hertha berlin may have saved his job . takahara headed the home side in front on three minutes before scoring the winner 10 minutes from time , lifting his team up to 13th place .
berlin midfielder christian müller had leveled in the 12th minute but it was all in vain .

" the resolution , which was put forward by right-wing parties , flew in the face of warnings from polish president aleksander kwasniewski that it could harm relations between germany and its eastern neighbours who joined the european union in may . belka said on friday that in his first official visit to berlin , he would use talks with chancellor gerhard schröder to " attempt to reach a common position on the issue of reparations . " he added that there was little point in poland raising the issue of reparations with germany because the demands are unrealistic . polish resolution " indefensible " schröder has dismissed the polish parliament 's resolution as indefensible . " i believe the call is untenable and also impossible to fulfill and the polish government knows that , " he said in a newspaper interview published thursday . although the polish government has announced that it is opposed in principle to demanding compensation from germany , it has said it will evaluate the extent of poland 's losses due to world war ii . and the fact that the resolution was passed by 320 votes to none with one abstention and that a recent opinion poll showed nearly two-thirds of poles supported the move , illustrates the strength of feeling over the issue and makes it one the warsaw government can not ignore . foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz recalled this week that poland had renounced seeking reparations from germany while under soviet rule in 1953 . a total of six million poles , including the majority of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after adolf hitler 's army invaded in 1939 . strained bilateral relations another 2.5 million were deported to labour camps in germany , while warsaw and other cities were nearly destroyed as the nazis sought to eradicate polish culture . relations between the two countries have also been strained by the claims of germans who demand compensation for being forced to leave territory handed over to poland at the end of world war ii . an analyst on polish-german affairs , dorota dakowska from the berlin-based marc bloch centre , said it was these claims which angered many poles who perceive that the ethnic germans " are trying to turn history on its head , by presenting themselves as the biggest victims of war after the jews .

" " the loss of homes is disproportionate compared with the death of six million poles , including three million jews , " she said . belka will spend three hours in berlin before returning to warsaw . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

addressing the controversial claims made by ethnic germans to reclaim the land they lost when they were expelled at the end of wwii , the two leaders said that joint efforts would be made to prevent the situation from deepening the rift polish-german relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.09.2004 turkey adopts key eu reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes it will be one of the stars on the eu flag turkish parliament on sunday for passed a crucial package of reforms aimed at boosting the country 's chances for starting membership talks with the european union . ankara took the unusual step of calling for an urgent parliamentary session on sunday to quickly pass a penal code reform package ahead of a crucial eu commission progress report to be issued oct .
6 .
both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes to become a full-fledged member of the eu eu officials have indicated that the bloc 's report is likely to recommend beginning the talks .
but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .

6 .
both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes to become a full-fledged member of the eu eu officials have indicated that the bloc 's report is likely to recommend beginning the talks .
but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .
more work ahead erdogan told his country that if brussels should give ankara a date , a long and difficult path still lies ahead .
" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .

6 .
both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes to become a full-fledged member of the eu eu officials have indicated that the bloc 's report is likely to recommend beginning the talks .
but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .
more work ahead erdogan told his country that if brussels should give ankara a date , a long and difficult path still lies ahead .
" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .
parliament has already debated a good number of the reform bills in the penal code , which has generally been welcomed for granting greater individual freedoms and calling for heavier penalties for torture and the abuse of human rights .
women 's groups , however , still remain critical of several amendments on the grounds that they discriminate against women .
critics say the draft fails to entirely ban virginity tests despite limiting their implementation to judicial cases , keeps an article on the books that can be used to reduce the sentences of perpetrators of " honor killings " and punishes consensual sex between minors . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günther verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiation with turkey .

here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .
the previously free scoring bayer players had no response and slip further off the pace into sixth . bayern gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy does it again .
bayern munich continue their ominous creeping run up the table with another victory , this time a 3-1 win over sc freiburg in the olympic stadium .
bayern moved up to fourth but again failed to show everything they are capable , relying once more on the outstanding dutch striker roy makaay who scored one goal and set up another .
but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .
reigning champions werder bremen continue to ease themselves back into contention and saturday 's 4-1 win away at bochum confirmed their intention not give up their title so easily after a run of indifferent results .
a hat-trick in 19 minutes by substitute striker miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- and close range effort from midfielder tim borowski enabled bremen to hang onto third place while inflicting bochum 's first defeat of the season .
slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .
di salvo reduced the arrears from close range in the 52nd minute and equalized seven minutes later with a volley from inside the box . nuremburg and arminia bielefeld , two of the promoted sides , battled it out for three hard won points with bielefeld the victors in a 2-1 away win .
a header on 18 minutes from striker fatmir vata put the visitors ahead and bielefeld increased their lead through midfielder patrick owomoyela on 64 minutes . bielefeld wins battle of promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : substitute stefan kiessling pulled one back for the home side with a header in the 76th minute but it was not enough for nuremburg who have seen their early stable form desert them of late .
nuremburg drop to 10th while bielefeld move up to 16th . bundesliga newcomers mainz continued their strong start by sharing the points with borussia dortmund courtesy of striker benjamin auer , who equalized in the 56th minute before a club record 20,300 crowd in the 1-1 draw on sunday .
jan koller had opened the scoring on nine minutes for dortmund .
more squandered points mean that bvb now sit eight points off the pace in seventh while mainz keep the leaders in sight , sitting two places ahead in fifth . toppmöller thanks takahara bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller .
hamburg coach klaus toppmöller can thank a first bundesliga double by japan striker naohiro takahara for the three points on sunday and may also like to offer his gratitude for keeping him in employment .
hamburg 's dismal season to date looked to have consigned toppmöller to the dole queue but the 2-1 win over hertha berlin may have saved his job . takahara headed the home side in front on three minutes before scoring the winner 10 minutes from time , lifting his team up to 13th place .
berlin midfielder christian müller had leveled in the 12th minute but it was all in vain .

both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .

erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .

here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .

but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .

slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .
di salvo reduced the arrears from close range in the 52nd minute and equalized seven minutes later with a volley from inside the box . nuremburg and arminia bielefeld , two of the promoted sides , battled it out for three hard won points with bielefeld the victors in a 2-1 away win .

jan koller had opened the scoring on nine minutes for dortmund .
more squandered points mean that bvb now sit eight points off the pace in seventh while mainz keep the leaders in sight , sitting two places ahead in fifth . toppmöller thanks takahara bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller .
hamburg coach klaus toppmöller can thank a first bundesliga double by japan striker naohiro takahara for the three points on sunday and may also like to offer his gratitude for keeping him in employment .
hamburg 's dismal season to date looked to have consigned toppmöller to the dole queue but the 2-1 win over hertha berlin may have saved his job . takahara headed the home side in front on three minutes before scoring the winner 10 minutes from time , lifting his team up to 13th place .
berlin midfielder christian müller had leveled in the 12th minute but it was all in vain .

" the resolution , which was put forward by right-wing parties , flew in the face of warnings from polish president aleksander kwasniewski that it could harm relations between germany and its eastern neighbours who joined the european union in may . belka said on friday that in his first official visit to berlin , he would use talks with chancellor gerhard schröder to " attempt to reach a common position on the issue of reparations . " he added that there was little point in poland raising the issue of reparations with germany because the demands are unrealistic . polish resolution " indefensible " schröder has dismissed the polish parliament 's resolution as indefensible . " i believe the call is untenable and also impossible to fulfill and the polish government knows that , " he said in a newspaper interview published thursday . although the polish government has announced that it is opposed in principle to demanding compensation from germany , it has said it will evaluate the extent of poland 's losses due to world war ii . and the fact that the resolution was passed by 320 votes to none with one abstention and that a recent opinion poll showed nearly two-thirds of poles supported the move , illustrates the strength of feeling over the issue and makes it one the warsaw government can not ignore . foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz recalled this week that poland had renounced seeking reparations from germany while under soviet rule in 1953 . a total of six million poles , including the majority of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after adolf hitler 's army invaded in 1939 . strained bilateral relations another 2.5 million were deported to labour camps in germany , while warsaw and other cities were nearly destroyed as the nazis sought to eradicate polish culture . relations between the two countries have also been strained by the claims of germans who demand compensation for being forced to leave territory handed over to poland at the end of world war ii . an analyst on polish-german affairs , dorota dakowska from the berlin-based marc bloch centre , said it was these claims which angered many poles who perceive that the ethnic germans " are trying to turn history on its head , by presenting themselves as the biggest victims of war after the jews .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 27.09.2004 poland , germany vow to squash reparations claims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belka and schröder presented a united front in berlin german chancellor gerhard schröder and polish prime minister marek belka appealed to the common sense of those germans and poles currently trying to revive a debate about world war ii reparation claims . following official talks in berlin , both schröder and belka once again declared on monday that the chapter on reparations has been closed .
addressing the controversial claims made by ethnic germans to reclaim the land they lost when they were expelled at the end of wwii , the two leaders said that joint efforts would be made to prevent the situation from deepening the rift polish-german relations .
among the ideas , the creation of a bilateral committee of legal experts who will seek to pre-empt any court proceedings initiated by representatives of ethnic germans who were expelled from present-day poland after the collapse of the third reich . no more oil on the fire “ i hope that our opposition conservative leaders will now step up their efforts to silence those in their ranks who ’ ve chosen to pour more oil on the fire in recent weeks , " schröder said at a press conference following his meeting with belka .
" it should be clear to anyone that restitution claims won ’ t lead anywhere , but will only poison relations between our two nations . ” the polish prime minister also rejected the resolution passed by the polish parliament , the sejm , earlier this month calling for germans to pay damages for the nazi occupation of their country .
he said that the issue had been dealt with at length in the past , and was settled once and for all . " calling for fresh negotiations on this matter does not only harm our bilateral relations , but relations between poland and the european union as a whole , ” belka added . claims and counter-claims the fresh debate about reparations claims was triggered some weeks ago by a small group representing an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans who were expelled or fled from present-day poland when germany 's borders shifted at the end of world war ii .
the group has threatened to take their claims to polish and european courts in a bid to receive restitution for ancestral property . in response , the polish parliament adopted a resolution calling for reparations for " the enormous material and spiritual destruction caused by german aggression , occupation , and genocide . " bilateral tensions over reparation claims peaked last week when the head of poland ’ s conservative law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , told a german news journal that the issue of reparation payments would be made a priority should his party be voted into power during the forthcoming elections in october . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish pm seeking joint position on wwii claims polish prime minister marek belka will visit the german capital on monday seeking a joint declaration on the sensitive issue of demands for compensation for the nazi occupation of poland in world war ii .

" although there is no international agreement on 100 percent multilateral debt relief , britain will do more , " brown said .
" we will pay our share of the multilateral debt repayments of reforming low-income countries , " he said . " we will make payments in their stead to the world bank and african development bank for the portion that relates to britain 's share of this debt , " the chancellor added .
" we do this alone today but i urge other countries to follow so that indebted countries are relieved of the burden of servicing all unpayable multilateral debt . " britain holds nearly 10 percent of the total debt owed to the world bank and other development banks , which itself amounts to 70 percent of the money owed by the world 's poorest nations . germany under pressure experts said brown 's announcement - ahead of a world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- meeting later this week - puts pressure on other group of seven industrialized nations to do likewise . chief among them are germany , japan and the united states , the world bank 's biggest stakeholders , while canada and france are said to have similar announcements in the planning stages . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development welcomed brown 's announcement .
" through debt relief , the budgets of the poorest , most indebted countries are unburdened , and the freed-up resources can then be invested in social and educational programs .
this new push from the british chancellor will set further , positive impulses for international development policy , which we basically support , " the ministry said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is germany 's economic cooperation and development minister while the ministry did not say whether germany intends to take up the challenge set by brown , it stressed that development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- advocated debt relief for the world 's poorest countries at the 1999 g8 summit in cologne , and in following negotiations with the world bank . common agricultural policy under fire brown 's announcement dovetails with prime minister tony blair 's intention of making the fight against poverty in africa a core theme of britain 's turn at the helm of the group of eight and the european union during 2005 . in his speech , which was greeted with a standing ovation at the end , brown lashed out at rich nations for failing to do more to end farm subsidies and clear away trade barriers which keep poor countries poor . in particular he condemned what he called the " scandal and waste " of the eu 's common agricultural policy , and regretted that " what the world lacks is the common and shared will to act " to alleviate global poverty . speaking from the pulpit of an anglican church , with a towering crucifix on the wall behind him , brown nevertheless called for a " new covenant " between developed and developing countries .

6 .
both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes to become a full-fledged member of the eu eu officials have indicated that the bloc 's report is likely to recommend beginning the talks .
but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .
more work ahead erdogan told his country that if brussels should give ankara a date , a long and difficult path still lies ahead .
" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .
parliament has already debated a good number of the reform bills in the penal code , which has generally been welcomed for granting greater individual freedoms and calling for heavier penalties for torture and the abuse of human rights .
women 's groups , however , still remain critical of several amendments on the grounds that they discriminate against women .

wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .

" the resolution , which was put forward by right-wing parties , flew in the face of warnings from polish president aleksander kwasniewski that it could harm relations between germany and its eastern neighbours who joined the european union in may . belka said on friday that in his first official visit to berlin , he would use talks with chancellor gerhard schröder to " attempt to reach a common position on the issue of reparations . " he added that there was little point in poland raising the issue of reparations with germany because the demands are unrealistic . polish resolution " indefensible " schröder has dismissed the polish parliament 's resolution as indefensible . " i believe the call is untenable and also impossible to fulfill and the polish government knows that , " he said in a newspaper interview published thursday . although the polish government has announced that it is opposed in principle to demanding compensation from germany , it has said it will evaluate the extent of poland 's losses due to world war ii . and the fact that the resolution was passed by 320 votes to none with one abstention and that a recent opinion poll showed nearly two-thirds of poles supported the move , illustrates the strength of feeling over the issue and makes it one the warsaw government can not ignore . foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz recalled this week that poland had renounced seeking reparations from germany while under soviet rule in 1953 . a total of six million poles , including the majority of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after adolf hitler 's army invaded in 1939 . strained bilateral relations another 2.5 million were deported to labour camps in germany , while warsaw and other cities were nearly destroyed as the nazis sought to eradicate polish culture . relations between the two countries have also been strained by the claims of germans who demand compensation for being forced to leave territory handed over to poland at the end of world war ii . an analyst on polish-german affairs , dorota dakowska from the berlin-based marc bloch centre , said it was these claims which angered many poles who perceive that the ethnic germans " are trying to turn history on its head , by presenting themselves as the biggest victims of war after the jews . " " the loss of homes is disproportionate compared with the death of six million poles , including three million jews , " she said . belka will spend three hours in berlin before returning to warsaw . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 27.09.2004 leaders ' victories keep it tight at the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl 's goal for stuttgart kept the heat on leaders wolfsburg week six saw a number of the top teams make a break from the pack with wins for leaders wolfsburg , second placed stuttgart , champions werder bremen and bayern munich .
here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .
the previously free scoring bayer players had no response and slip further off the pace into sixth . bayern gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy does it again .
bayern munich continue their ominous creeping run up the table with another victory , this time a 3-1 win over sc freiburg in the olympic stadium .
bayern moved up to fourth but again failed to show everything they are capable , relying once more on the outstanding dutch striker roy makaay who scored one goal and set up another .
but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .
reigning champions werder bremen continue to ease themselves back into contention and saturday 's 4-1 win away at bochum confirmed their intention not give up their title so easily after a run of indifferent results .
a hat-trick in 19 minutes by substitute striker miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- and close range effort from midfielder tim borowski enabled bremen to hang onto third place while inflicting bochum 's first defeat of the season .
slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .
di salvo reduced the arrears from close range in the 52nd minute and equalized seven minutes later with a volley from inside the box . nuremburg and arminia bielefeld , two of the promoted sides , battled it out for three hard won points with bielefeld the victors in a 2-1 away win .
a header on 18 minutes from striker fatmir vata put the visitors ahead and bielefeld increased their lead through midfielder patrick owomoyela on 64 minutes . bielefeld wins battle of promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : substitute stefan kiessling pulled one back for the home side with a header in the 76th minute but it was not enough for nuremburg who have seen their early stable form desert them of late .
nuremburg drop to 10th while bielefeld move up to 16th . bundesliga newcomers mainz continued their strong start by sharing the points with borussia dortmund courtesy of striker benjamin auer , who equalized in the 56th minute before a club record 20,300 crowd in the 1-1 draw on sunday .
jan koller had opened the scoring on nine minutes for dortmund .
more squandered points mean that bvb now sit eight points off the pace in seventh while mainz keep the leaders in sight , sitting two places ahead in fifth . toppmöller thanks takahara bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller .
hamburg coach klaus toppmöller can thank a first bundesliga double by japan striker naohiro takahara for the three points on sunday and may also like to offer his gratitude for keeping him in employment .
hamburg 's dismal season to date looked to have consigned toppmöller to the dole queue but the 2-1 win over hertha berlin may have saved his job . takahara headed the home side in front on three minutes before scoring the winner 10 minutes from time , lifting his team up to 13th place .
berlin midfielder christian müller had leveled in the 12th minute but it was all in vain .
berlin are fourth from bottom and are the only side without victory after six games . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stuttgart sends leverkusen spiraling since outclassing real madrid in the champion 's league two weeks ago , bayer leverkusen has been a shadow of its former self .

both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .

but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .
more work ahead erdogan told his country that if brussels should give ankara a date , a long and difficult path still lies ahead .
" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .
parliament has already debated a good number of the reform bills in the penal code , which has generally been welcomed for granting greater individual freedoms and calling for heavier penalties for torture and the abuse of human rights .
women 's groups , however , still remain critical of several amendments on the grounds that they discriminate against women .
critics say the draft fails to entirely ban virginity tests despite limiting their implementation to judicial cases , keeps an article on the books that can be used to reduce the sentences of perpetrators of " honor killings " and punishes consensual sex between minors . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günther verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiation with turkey .

" although there is no international agreement on 100 percent multilateral debt relief , britain will do more , " brown said .

" the resolution , which was put forward by right-wing parties , flew in the face of warnings from polish president aleksander kwasniewski that it could harm relations between germany and its eastern neighbours who joined the european union in may . belka said on friday that in his first official visit to berlin , he would use talks with chancellor gerhard schröder to " attempt to reach a common position on the issue of reparations . " he added that there was little point in poland raising the issue of reparations with germany because the demands are unrealistic . polish resolution " indefensible " schröder has dismissed the polish parliament 's resolution as indefensible . " i believe the call is untenable and also impossible to fulfill and the polish government knows that , " he said in a newspaper interview published thursday . although the polish government has announced that it is opposed in principle to demanding compensation from germany , it has said it will evaluate the extent of poland 's losses due to world war ii . and the fact that the resolution was passed by 320 votes to none with one abstention and that a recent opinion poll showed nearly two-thirds of poles supported the move , illustrates the strength of feeling over the issue and makes it one the warsaw government can not ignore . foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz recalled this week that poland had renounced seeking reparations from germany while under soviet rule in 1953 . a total of six million poles , including the majority of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after adolf hitler 's army invaded in 1939 . strained bilateral relations another 2.5 million were deported to labour camps in germany , while warsaw and other cities were nearly destroyed as the nazis sought to eradicate polish culture . relations between the two countries have also been strained by the claims of germans who demand compensation for being forced to leave territory handed over to poland at the end of world war ii . an analyst on polish-german affairs , dorota dakowska from the berlin-based marc bloch centre , said it was these claims which angered many poles who perceive that the ethnic germans " are trying to turn history on its head , by presenting themselves as the biggest victims of war after the jews . " " the loss of homes is disproportionate compared with the death of six million poles , including three million jews , " she said . belka will spend three hours in berlin before returning to warsaw . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

addressing the controversial claims made by ethnic germans to reclaim the land they lost when they were expelled at the end of wwii , the two leaders said that joint efforts would be made to prevent the situation from deepening the rift polish-german relations .
among the ideas , the creation of a bilateral committee of legal experts who will seek to pre-empt any court proceedings initiated by representatives of ethnic germans who were expelled from present-day poland after the collapse of the third reich . no more oil on the fire “ i hope that our opposition conservative leaders will now step up their efforts to silence those in their ranks who ’ ve chosen to pour more oil on the fire in recent weeks , " schröder said at a press conference following his meeting with belka .
" it should be clear to anyone that restitution claims won ’ t lead anywhere , but will only poison relations between our two nations . ” the polish prime minister also rejected the resolution passed by the polish parliament , the sejm , earlier this month calling for germans to pay damages for the nazi occupation of their country .
he said that the issue had been dealt with at length in the past , and was settled once and for all . " calling for fresh negotiations on this matter does not only harm our bilateral relations , but relations between poland and the european union as a whole , ” belka added . claims and counter-claims the fresh debate about reparations claims was triggered some weeks ago by a small group representing an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans who were expelled or fled from present-day poland when germany 's borders shifted at the end of world war ii .
the group has threatened to take their claims to polish and european courts in a bid to receive restitution for ancestral property . in response , the polish parliament adopted a resolution calling for reparations for " the enormous material and spiritual destruction caused by german aggression , occupation , and genocide . " bilateral tensions over reparation claims peaked last week when the head of poland ’ s conservative law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , told a german news journal that the issue of reparation payments would be made a priority should his party be voted into power during the forthcoming elections in october . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish pm seeking joint position on wwii claims polish prime minister marek belka will visit the german capital on monday seeking a joint declaration on the sensitive issue of demands for compensation for the nazi occupation of poland in world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.09.2004 turkey adopts key eu reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes it will be one of the stars on the eu flag turkish parliament on sunday for passed a crucial package of reforms aimed at boosting the country 's chances for starting membership talks with the european union . ankara took the unusual step of calling for an urgent parliamentary session on sunday to quickly pass a penal code reform package ahead of a crucial eu commission progress report to be issued oct .
6 .
both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes to become a full-fledged member of the eu eu officials have indicated that the bloc 's report is likely to recommend beginning the talks .
but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .
more work ahead erdogan told his country that if brussels should give ankara a date , a long and difficult path still lies ahead .
" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .
parliament has already debated a good number of the reform bills in the penal code , which has generally been welcomed for granting greater individual freedoms and calling for heavier penalties for torture and the abuse of human rights .
women 's groups , however , still remain critical of several amendments on the grounds that they discriminate against women .
critics say the draft fails to entirely ban virginity tests despite limiting their implementation to judicial cases , keeps an article on the books that can be used to reduce the sentences of perpetrators of " honor killings " and punishes consensual sex between minors . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günther verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiation with turkey .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 27.09.2004 leaders ' victories keep it tight at the top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin stranzl 's goal for stuttgart kept the heat on leaders wolfsburg week six saw a number of the top teams make a break from the pack with wins for leaders wolfsburg , second placed stuttgart , champions werder bremen and bayern munich .
here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .
the previously free scoring bayer players had no response and slip further off the pace into sixth . bayern gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy does it again .
bayern munich continue their ominous creeping run up the table with another victory , this time a 3-1 win over sc freiburg in the olympic stadium .
bayern moved up to fourth but again failed to show everything they are capable , relying once more on the outstanding dutch striker roy makaay who scored one goal and set up another .
but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .
reigning champions werder bremen continue to ease themselves back into contention and saturday 's 4-1 win away at bochum confirmed their intention not give up their title so easily after a run of indifferent results .
a hat-trick in 19 minutes by substitute striker miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- and close range effort from midfielder tim borowski enabled bremen to hang onto third place while inflicting bochum 's first defeat of the season .
slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .

" the resolution , which was put forward by right-wing parties , flew in the face of warnings from polish president aleksander kwasniewski that it could harm relations between germany and its eastern neighbours who joined the european union in may . belka said on friday that in his first official visit to berlin , he would use talks with chancellor gerhard schröder to " attempt to reach a common position on the issue of reparations . " he added that there was little point in poland raising the issue of reparations with germany because the demands are unrealistic . polish resolution " indefensible " schröder has dismissed the polish parliament 's resolution as indefensible . " i believe the call is untenable and also impossible to fulfill and the polish government knows that , " he said in a newspaper interview published thursday . although the polish government has announced that it is opposed in principle to demanding compensation from germany , it has said it will evaluate the extent of poland 's losses due to world war ii . and the fact that the resolution was passed by 320 votes to none with one abstention and that a recent opinion poll showed nearly two-thirds of poles supported the move , illustrates the strength of feeling over the issue and makes it one the warsaw government can not ignore . foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz recalled this week that poland had renounced seeking reparations from germany while under soviet rule in 1953 . a total of six million poles , including the majority of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after adolf hitler 's army invaded in 1939 . strained bilateral relations another 2.5 million were deported to labour camps in germany , while warsaw and other cities were nearly destroyed as the nazis sought to eradicate polish culture . relations between the two countries have also been strained by the claims of germans who demand compensation for being forced to leave territory handed over to poland at the end of world war ii . an analyst on polish-german affairs , dorota dakowska from the berlin-based marc bloch centre , said it was these claims which angered many poles who perceive that the ethnic germans " are trying to turn history on its head , by presenting themselves as the biggest victims of war after the jews .

here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .
the previously free scoring bayer players had no response and slip further off the pace into sixth . bayern gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy does it again .
bayern munich continue their ominous creeping run up the table with another victory , this time a 3-1 win over sc freiburg in the olympic stadium .
bayern moved up to fourth but again failed to show everything they are capable , relying once more on the outstanding dutch striker roy makaay who scored one goal and set up another .
but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .
reigning champions werder bremen continue to ease themselves back into contention and saturday 's 4-1 win away at bochum confirmed their intention not give up their title so easily after a run of indifferent results .
a hat-trick in 19 minutes by substitute striker miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- and close range effort from midfielder tim borowski enabled bremen to hang onto third place while inflicting bochum 's first defeat of the season .
slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .
di salvo reduced the arrears from close range in the 52nd minute and equalized seven minutes later with a volley from inside the box . nuremburg and arminia bielefeld , two of the promoted sides , battled it out for three hard won points with bielefeld the victors in a 2-1 away win .

" although there is no international agreement on 100 percent multilateral debt relief , britain will do more , " brown said .
" we will pay our share of the multilateral debt repayments of reforming low-income countries , " he said . " we will make payments in their stead to the world bank and african development bank for the portion that relates to britain 's share of this debt , " the chancellor added .
" we do this alone today but i urge other countries to follow so that indebted countries are relieved of the burden of servicing all unpayable multilateral debt . " britain holds nearly 10 percent of the total debt owed to the world bank and other development banks , which itself amounts to 70 percent of the money owed by the world 's poorest nations . germany under pressure experts said brown 's announcement - ahead of a world bank and international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- meeting later this week - puts pressure on other group of seven industrialized nations to do likewise . chief among them are germany , japan and the united states , the world bank 's biggest stakeholders , while canada and france are said to have similar announcements in the planning stages . germany 's ministry for economic cooperation and development welcomed brown 's announcement .
" through debt relief , the budgets of the poorest , most indebted countries are unburdened , and the freed-up resources can then be invested in social and educational programs .
this new push from the british chancellor will set further , positive impulses for international development policy , which we basically support , " the ministry said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is germany 's economic cooperation and development minister while the ministry did not say whether germany intends to take up the challenge set by brown , it stressed that development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul -lrb- photo -rrb- advocated debt relief for the world 's poorest countries at the 1999 g8 summit in cologne , and in following negotiations with the world bank . common agricultural policy under fire brown 's announcement dovetails with prime minister tony blair 's intention of making the fight against poverty in africa a core theme of britain 's turn at the helm of the group of eight and the european union during 2005 . in his speech , which was greeted with a standing ovation at the end , brown lashed out at rich nations for failing to do more to end farm subsidies and clear away trade barriers which keep poor countries poor . in particular he condemned what he called the " scandal and waste " of the eu 's common agricultural policy , and regretted that " what the world lacks is the common and shared will to act " to alleviate global poverty . speaking from the pulpit of an anglican church , with a towering crucifix on the wall behind him , brown nevertheless called for a " new covenant " between developed and developing countries . " have confidence , " he told his audience , " that together , we can make poverty history .

addressing the controversial claims made by ethnic germans to reclaim the land they lost when they were expelled at the end of wwii , the two leaders said that joint efforts would be made to prevent the situation from deepening the rift polish-german relations .
among the ideas , the creation of a bilateral committee of legal experts who will seek to pre-empt any court proceedings initiated by representatives of ethnic germans who were expelled from present-day poland after the collapse of the third reich . no more oil on the fire “ i hope that our opposition conservative leaders will now step up their efforts to silence those in their ranks who ’ ve chosen to pour more oil on the fire in recent weeks , " schröder said at a press conference following his meeting with belka .
" it should be clear to anyone that restitution claims won ’ t lead anywhere , but will only poison relations between our two nations . ” the polish prime minister also rejected the resolution passed by the polish parliament , the sejm , earlier this month calling for germans to pay damages for the nazi occupation of their country .
he said that the issue had been dealt with at length in the past , and was settled once and for all . " calling for fresh negotiations on this matter does not only harm our bilateral relations , but relations between poland and the european union as a whole , ” belka added . claims and counter-claims the fresh debate about reparations claims was triggered some weeks ago by a small group representing an estimated 2.5 million ethnic germans who were expelled or fled from present-day poland when germany 's borders shifted at the end of world war ii .
the group has threatened to take their claims to polish and european courts in a bid to receive restitution for ancestral property . in response , the polish parliament adopted a resolution calling for reparations for " the enormous material and spiritual destruction caused by german aggression , occupation , and genocide . " bilateral tensions over reparation claims peaked last week when the head of poland ’ s conservative law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , told a german news journal that the issue of reparation payments would be made a priority should his party be voted into power during the forthcoming elections in october . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish pm seeking joint position on wwii claims polish prime minister marek belka will visit the german capital on monday seeking a joint declaration on the sensitive issue of demands for compensation for the nazi occupation of poland in world war ii .

" the resolution , which was put forward by right-wing parties , flew in the face of warnings from polish president aleksander kwasniewski that it could harm relations between germany and its eastern neighbours who joined the european union in may . belka said on friday that in his first official visit to berlin , he would use talks with chancellor gerhard schröder to " attempt to reach a common position on the issue of reparations . " he added that there was little point in poland raising the issue of reparations with germany because the demands are unrealistic . polish resolution " indefensible " schröder has dismissed the polish parliament 's resolution as indefensible . " i believe the call is untenable and also impossible to fulfill and the polish government knows that , " he said in a newspaper interview published thursday . although the polish government has announced that it is opposed in principle to demanding compensation from germany , it has said it will evaluate the extent of poland 's losses due to world war ii . and the fact that the resolution was passed by 320 votes to none with one abstention and that a recent opinion poll showed nearly two-thirds of poles supported the move , illustrates the strength of feeling over the issue and makes it one the warsaw government can not ignore . foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz recalled this week that poland had renounced seeking reparations from germany while under soviet rule in 1953 . a total of six million poles , including the majority of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after adolf hitler 's army invaded in 1939 . strained bilateral relations another 2.5 million were deported to labour camps in germany , while warsaw and other cities were nearly destroyed as the nazis sought to eradicate polish culture . relations between the two countries have also been strained by the claims of germans who demand compensation for being forced to leave territory handed over to poland at the end of world war ii . an analyst on polish-german affairs , dorota dakowska from the berlin-based marc bloch centre , said it was these claims which angered many poles who perceive that the ethnic germans " are trying to turn history on its head , by presenting themselves as the biggest victims of war after the jews . " " the loss of homes is disproportionate compared with the death of six million poles , including three million jews , " she said . belka will spend three hours in berlin before returning to warsaw . afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de poland wo n't seek german reparations the polish government will evaluate the country 's losses during world war ii , but will not seek reparations from germany over the nazi invasion , foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz said .

6 .
both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes to become a full-fledged member of the eu eu officials have indicated that the bloc 's report is likely to recommend beginning the talks .
but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .
more work ahead erdogan told his country that if brussels should give ankara a date , a long and difficult path still lies ahead .
" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .
parliament has already debated a good number of the reform bills in the penal code , which has generally been welcomed for granting greater individual freedoms and calling for heavier penalties for torture and the abuse of human rights .
women 's groups , however , still remain critical of several amendments on the grounds that they discriminate against women .
critics say the draft fails to entirely ban virginity tests despite limiting their implementation to judicial cases , keeps an article on the books that can be used to reduce the sentences of perpetrators of " honor killings " and punishes consensual sex between minors . dw staff -lrb- afp / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verheugen : no more obstacles to talks with turkey after meeting with turkish prime minister recep tayyp erdogan thursday morning , eu expansion commissioner günther verheugen is ready to recommend europe start membership negotiation with turkey .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .

here is the run down of the weekend 's action . wolfsburg 's championship aspirations were given another boost on saturday as the surprising league leaders recorded their fifth win in six games with a 2-1 victory over kaiserslautern . wolfsburg 's bulgarian striker martin petrov opened the scoring for the home side from a free kick on 13 minutes but journeyman striker carsten jancker put kaiserslautern level from close range with eight minutes remaining .
wolfsburg then rallied for one final hurrah and kept a grip on the top slot thanks to a last-minute goal from argentine striker diego klimowicz . one point behind wolfsburg sit stuttgart who stayed in second after a thrilling 3-0 win over bayer leverkusen .
leverkusen , who had looked to be the season 's pace setters just a couple of weeks ago , were brushed aside by a dominant stuttgart midfield which built first-half goals for defenders philipp lahm and martin stranzl and helped set up the move from which midfielder silvio meissner 's late penalty was awarded .
the previously free scoring bayer players had no response and slip further off the pace into sixth . bayern gathering pace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy does it again .
bayern munich continue their ominous creeping run up the table with another victory , this time a 3-1 win over sc freiburg in the olympic stadium .
bayern moved up to fourth but again failed to show everything they are capable , relying once more on the outstanding dutch striker roy makaay who scored one goal and set up another .
but the home side found themselves one down within three minutes after freiburg striker wilfried sanou exposed a dithering defense to score from just inside the box . it took bayern a quarter of an hour to build an equalizer and it came from a blunder within the freiburg defense which left makaay free to score .
the dutchman then set up midfielder torsten frings to give bayern the lead against the run of play just before halftime .
playmaker michael ballack completed the victory with a header on 72 minutes . bremen thump bochum bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the klose show finished off bochum .
reigning champions werder bremen continue to ease themselves back into contention and saturday 's 4-1 win away at bochum confirmed their intention not give up their title so easily after a run of indifferent results .
a hat-trick in 19 minutes by substitute striker miroslav klose -lrb- photo -rrb- and close range effort from midfielder tim borowski enabled bremen to hang onto third place while inflicting bochum 's first defeat of the season .
slovenia defender aleksander knavs equalized for the home side with a header in the 68th minute but klose 's introduction was to prove emphatic . a brief respite for schalke 04 came to a close when the royal blues visited hanover 96 at the weekend .
a run of bad results for schalke looked to have been left behind but the 1-0 defeat courtesy of a goal from clint mathis on saturday saw the coachless gelsenkirchen team drop to 14th .
their first victory of the season helped lift hanover off the bottom of the league . rostock rock bottom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock are propping up the bundesliga .
hanover 's victory meant that hansa rostock 's 2-2 draw with borussia mönchengladbach was not enough to give the northerners a lift and hansa dropped to the foot of the league despite fighting back from two goals down .
antonio di salvo 's double may have saved a point but it was not enough to raise rostock from the basement . oliver neuville opened the scoring for the home side from inside the area in the 18th minute and doubled the advantage for mönchengladbach from a penalty 12 minutes later .
di salvo reduced the arrears from close range in the 52nd minute and equalized seven minutes later with a volley from inside the box . nuremburg and arminia bielefeld , two of the promoted sides , battled it out for three hard won points with bielefeld the victors in a 2-1 away win .
a header on 18 minutes from striker fatmir vata put the visitors ahead and bielefeld increased their lead through midfielder patrick owomoyela on 64 minutes . bielefeld wins battle of promoted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : substitute stefan kiessling pulled one back for the home side with a header in the 76th minute but it was not enough for nuremburg who have seen their early stable form desert them of late .

jan koller had opened the scoring on nine minutes for dortmund .
more squandered points mean that bvb now sit eight points off the pace in seventh while mainz keep the leaders in sight , sitting two places ahead in fifth . toppmöller thanks takahara bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller .
hamburg coach klaus toppmöller can thank a first bundesliga double by japan striker naohiro takahara for the three points on sunday and may also like to offer his gratitude for keeping him in employment .
hamburg 's dismal season to date looked to have consigned toppmöller to the dole queue but the 2-1 win over hertha berlin may have saved his job . takahara headed the home side in front on three minutes before scoring the winner 10 minutes from time , lifting his team up to 13th place .
berlin midfielder christian müller had leveled in the 12th minute but it was all in vain .

both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .

23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .

but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .

" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .
parliament has already debated a good number of the reform bills in the penal code , which has generally been welcomed for granting greater individual freedoms and calling for heavier penalties for torture and the abuse of human rights .
women 's groups , however , still remain critical of several amendments on the grounds that they discriminate against women .

both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .

addressing the controversial claims made by ethnic germans to reclaim the land they lost when they were expelled at the end of wwii , the two leaders said that joint efforts would be made to prevent the situation from deepening the rift polish-german relations .
among the ideas , the creation of a bilateral committee of legal experts who will seek to pre-empt any court proceedings initiated by representatives of ethnic germans who were expelled from present-day poland after the collapse of the third reich . no more oil on the fire “ i hope that our opposition conservative leaders will now step up their efforts to silence those in their ranks who ’ ve chosen to pour more oil on the fire in recent weeks , " schröder said at a press conference following his meeting with belka .

the group has threatened to take their claims to polish and european courts in a bid to receive restitution for ancestral property . in response , the polish parliament adopted a resolution calling for reparations for " the enormous material and spiritual destruction caused by german aggression , occupation , and genocide . " bilateral tensions over reparation claims peaked last week when the head of poland ’ s conservative law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , told a german news journal that the issue of reparation payments would be made a priority should his party be voted into power during the forthcoming elections in october . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish pm seeking joint position on wwii claims polish prime minister marek belka will visit the german capital on monday seeking a joint declaration on the sensitive issue of demands for compensation for the nazi occupation of poland in world war ii .

both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes to become a full-fledged member of the eu eu officials have indicated that the bloc 's report is likely to recommend beginning the talks .
but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .
more work ahead erdogan told his country that if brussels should give ankara a date , a long and difficult path still lies ahead .
" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .
parliament has already debated a good number of the reform bills in the penal code , which has generally been welcomed for granting greater individual freedoms and calling for heavier penalties for torture and the abuse of human rights .
women 's groups , however , still remain critical of several amendments on the grounds that they discriminate against women .

" the resolution , which was put forward by right-wing parties , flew in the face of warnings from polish president aleksander kwasniewski that it could harm relations between germany and its eastern neighbours who joined the european union in may . belka said on friday that in his first official visit to berlin , he would use talks with chancellor gerhard schröder to " attempt to reach a common position on the issue of reparations . " he added that there was little point in poland raising the issue of reparations with germany because the demands are unrealistic . polish resolution " indefensible " schröder has dismissed the polish parliament 's resolution as indefensible . " i believe the call is untenable and also impossible to fulfill and the polish government knows that , " he said in a newspaper interview published thursday . although the polish government has announced that it is opposed in principle to demanding compensation from germany , it has said it will evaluate the extent of poland 's losses due to world war ii . and the fact that the resolution was passed by 320 votes to none with one abstention and that a recent opinion poll showed nearly two-thirds of poles supported the move , illustrates the strength of feeling over the issue and makes it one the warsaw government can not ignore . foreign minister wlodzimierz cimoszewicz recalled this week that poland had renounced seeking reparations from germany while under soviet rule in 1953 . a total of six million poles , including the majority of the country 's pre-war population of 3.1 million jews , are believed to have been killed after adolf hitler 's army invaded in 1939 . strained bilateral relations another 2.5 million were deported to labour camps in germany , while warsaw and other cities were nearly destroyed as the nazis sought to eradicate polish culture . relations between the two countries have also been strained by the claims of germans who demand compensation for being forced to leave territory handed over to poland at the end of world war ii . an analyst on polish-german affairs , dorota dakowska from the berlin-based marc bloch centre , said it was these claims which angered many poles who perceive that the ethnic germans " are trying to turn history on its head , by presenting themselves as the biggest victims of war after the jews .

both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .

23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .

but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .
more work ahead erdogan told his country that if brussels should give ankara a date , a long and difficult path still lies ahead .
" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .
parliament has already debated a good number of the reform bills in the penal code , which has generally been welcomed for granting greater individual freedoms and calling for heavier penalties for torture and the abuse of human rights .
women 's groups , however , still remain critical of several amendments on the grounds that they discriminate against women .

6 .
both the government and opposition parties overwhelmingly supported the measures , after prime minister recep tayyip erdogan agreed to drop a controversial plan to criminalize adultery .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan only weeks before , the introduction of the reform package had been hotly contested after members in erdogan 's conservative islamic-based party refused to pass the new penal code , which includes laws against rape , pedophilia and torture as well as improvements of human rights standards , because it did not mention adultery as one of the punishable crimes .
no ban on adultery prior to erdogan 's u-turn on the issue , the debate had raised eyebrows in brussels , and caused many in the eu to wonder if ankara was really on the straight road to europe .
following fence-mending talks with eu enlargement commissioner günter verheugen in brussels on thursday , erdogan said that the plans to criminalzie adultery had been abandoned and appealed for a special parliamentary session to finish work on the penal code reform .
waiting for an invitation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter verheugen , the european union 's enlargement commissioner , right , shakes hands with turkey 's prime minister recep tayyip erdogan on sept .
23 , 2004 verheugen , for his part , said there were " no more obstacles on the table " ahead of the release of the commission 's progress report , which forms the basis for a december 17 decision by eu leaders on whether to begin membership negotiations with turkey , a vast and relatively poor muslim country that has been left in limbo since gaining official candidate status in 1999 .
erdogan , who has made joining the eu his top party , expressed confidence that brussels would give his country the green light .
" i would like to state very openly , clearly that i am hopeful that a date for accession talks will be determined in december this year , " he said during a televised address to the nation late saturday .
" we will finish up the final things that are missing until the report is announced and start waiting for the good news , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey hopes to become a full-fledged member of the eu eu officials have indicated that the bloc 's report is likely to recommend beginning the talks .
but many leaders have also signaled that it will be years before turkey becomes a full-fledged member .
despite the connections between erdogan 's justice and development party and the conservative islamic movement , the prime minister has been able to push through sweeping democratic reforms , broadening the freedom of expression , granting greater rights to the kurdish minority and trimming the role of the military in politics - prerequisites set by brussels .
more work ahead erdogan told his country that if brussels should give ankara a date , a long and difficult path still lies ahead .
" but we will head down it with enthusiasm .
we are aware that we should work with sincerity , determination and patience throughout the negotiation process , " he said .
parliament has already debated a good number of the reform bills in the penal code , which has generally been welcomed for granting greater individual freedoms and calling for heavier penalties for torture and the abuse of human rights .
women 's groups , however , still remain critical of several amendments on the grounds that they discriminate against women .

the party 's central committee said in a policy paper quoted by the official xinhua news agency that communist rule could not be taken for granted .
the anti-graft drive was a " life and death struggle " for the party , it said .
thousands of officials have recently been punished for corruption , but the problem is continuing , analysts say .
the 36-page report amounts to an admission that the communist party is facing a legitimacy crisis , the bbc 's louisa lim in beijing reports .
china 's leaders are now grappling with popular discontent at what is seen as widespread corruption among party members , our correspondent says .
tough talk , old message " we must develop a stronger sense of crisis , draw experience and lessons from the success and failure of other ruling parties in the world and enhance our governance capability in a more earnest and conscientious manner , " the report said .
" some leading party members do n't have a strong sense of responsibility , personal integrity , a down-to-earth style of work or a close connection with the general public , " it said .
although the report called for expanded " socialist democracy " and " ideological innovation " , the state-run media gave no hint that the party was prepared to relax its power monopoly , while implementing capitalist-style reforms .
the report did not specify how the party would improve its ability to govern , analysts say .
hu 's rise the document bears the stamp of party leader hu jintao , who has been warning that abuse of power and corruption are undermining the party 's image , our correspondent adds .
a party meeting earlier this month sealed president hu jintao 's leadership by appointing him head the powerful central military commission , succeeding former leader jiang zemin .
the move will consolidate mr hu 's position as china 's paramount leader , analysts say .

a scottish executive-funded grant to help remote rural stations modernise is about to be extended after criticism that its rules were too tight .
but it is claimed that it may not be enough for many struggling outlets .
scotland 's filling stations are closing at the rate of two per week .
the impact is felt most critically in rural places , like the borders and highlands .
petrol stations in country areas can be a long way from each other .
handouts ' not enough ' as many as 61 remote rural filling stations have benefited over six years from the scheme to the tune of £ 2.7m.
the qualifying rules will be relaxed from next month to increase the number eligible for help .
ian galloway who runs a filling station in twynholm , kirkcudbrightshire , got a 50 % grant from the local enterprise agency to help replace aging pumps .
mr galloway said : " it 's allowed us to extend the life of this site by probably 15 years at half the expense , which enables us to give a good service to the local community . "
but the petrol retailers association argued that pumping in cash in the form of capital grants was only part of the answer .
it insisted most closures were because owners simply could not make a living and needed continuing revenue grants or subsidies to maintain their vital " social service " .

a scottish executive-funded grant to help remote rural stations modernise is about to be extended after criticism that its rules were too tight .

scotland 's filling stations are closing at the rate of two per week .

the qualifying rules will be relaxed from next month to increase the number eligible for help .
ian galloway who runs a filling station in twynholm , kirkcudbrightshire , got a 50 % grant from the local enterprise agency to help replace aging pumps .
mr galloway said : " it 's allowed us to extend the life of this site by probably 15 years at half the expense , which enables us to give a good service to the local community . "

more than 20,000 people voted for britain 's worst place to live and the results will be published next month in crap towns ii - the nation decides .
luton is probably best known for the vauxhall car factory and its airport , which featured in a famous 1977 campari advert starring lorraine chase .
but residents have hailed the bedfordshire town 's community spirit .
the 10 worst towns 1-luton 2-windsor 3-sunderland 4-glasgow and edinburgh 6-clapham 7-bath 8-nottingham 9-corby 10-middlesbrough crap towns ii is the sequel to last year 's crap towns survey , which was edited by the idler magazine 's sam jordison and dan kieron .
david franks , executive leader of luton borough council and born and bred in the town , said : " this is hardly a scientific study .
" one of the measures of how happy a community is how often people volunteer and we have a huge number of voluntary groups .
" we also have excellent sports and fitness centres , a thriving sunday football league , great restaurants and we are one of the only towns to have a multiplex cinema in the centre .
" luton has a vibrant multi-cultural community . "
cllr franks said he was sure a town centre regeneration programme would result in luton being knocked off the top spot next year .
but liz chinchen , 39 , a pr officer now based in london but who lived in luton for 25 years , said she would never go back .
she said : " growing up there in the 70s and 80s , it was the kind of place that as soon as one of your friends could drive you spent every friday and saturday heading down the m1 to london .
" when people ask me where i am from i tend to say bedfordshire as i do n't want to own up to coming from luton . "
but she did admit that times were changing and she praised its multi-culturalism .
' rampant self-neglect ' then , hull was named the nation 's worst town with one voter describing it as a " sad story of unemployment , teenage pregnancy , heroin addiction , crime , violence , and rampant self-neglect " .
this year , hull dropped down to 19th .
windsor was voted the second worst place to live this time around .
one voter said : " the big thing about windsor is that its townsfolk believe that by living near the castle they are more or less royalty themselves . "
sunderland - " not so much a town as a mortuary " - came in third followed by edinburgh and glasgow in joint fourth .

more than 20,000 people voted for britain 's worst place to live and the results will be published next month in crap towns ii - the nation decides .
luton is probably best known for the vauxhall car factory and its airport , which featured in a famous 1977 campari advert starring lorraine chase .
but residents have hailed the bedfordshire town 's community spirit .
the 10 worst towns 1-luton 2-windsor 3-sunderland 4-glasgow and edinburgh 6-clapham 7-bath 8-nottingham 9-corby 10-middlesbrough crap towns ii is the sequel to last year 's crap towns survey , which was edited by the idler magazine 's sam jordison and dan kieron .
david franks , executive leader of luton borough council and born and bred in the town , said : " this is hardly a scientific study .
" one of the measures of how happy a community is how often people volunteer and we have a huge number of voluntary groups .
" we also have excellent sports and fitness centres , a thriving sunday football league , great restaurants and we are one of the only towns to have a multiplex cinema in the centre .
" luton has a vibrant multi-cultural community . "
luton airport is another well-known feature cllr franks said he was sure a town centre regeneration programme would result in luton being knocked off the top spot next year .
but liz chinchen , 39 , a pr officer now based in london but who lived in luton for 25 years , said she would never go back .
she said : " growing up there in the 70s and 80s , it was the kind of place that as soon as one of your friends could drive you spent every friday and saturday heading down the m1 to london .

the film , which has its uk premiere on monday and opens there next week , stars jude law and gwyneth paltrow in a retro-futuristic thriller set in 1930s new york .
paltrow plays reporter polly perkins , who joins her former love sky captain -lrb- law -rrb- on a mission to stop a mad scientist 's plot to destroy the world .
the pair battle giant robots on a trail that takes them from the frozen himalayas to a prehistoric jungle island .
the cast filmed their scenes against a blue screen , and were later placed into fantastic settings with thousands of spectacular digital effects filled in .
storyboard drawings " it was difficult at times , but at the same time you also free your mind and your art follows " jude law first-time director kerry conran spent almost a decade working on the $ 70m -lrb- £ 39m -rrb- project , beginning with a series of storyboard drawings which he converted to digital images on his laptop .
after producing a six-minute short , the process was later refined and the still graphics animated to produce a rough 3-d video using digital actors , called an animatic .
as technical aspects such as the lighting , depth and composition were enhanced , a grid was created for each slot and mapped out on the blue screen stage floor .
using acting doubles , the film was shot all the way through in a kind of " dress rehearsal " before law , paltrow , angelina jolie and others were brought in .
once adjustments of angles and shadows had been made to produce a cohesive rough cut , the stars spent just a month on the shoot - far shorter than the time usually needed on location .
' sea of blue ' the film 's producer , jon avnet , said : " what was valuable with the animatics is that it showed the actors what the shot was .
" there was enough detail for paltrow to understand exactly what was happening and that when she 's stepping on dots , it 's actually an entire plane . "
paltrow said : " it was a sea of blue , literally .
it was blue everywhere , blue floors , blue walls with various dots in places to orient the computer . "
law said the process was not always easy : " it was difficult at times , but at the same time you also free your mind , and your art follows .
" we were really in this kind of make-believe world , anyhow .
you could say it was kind of similar to doing theatre in empty spaces . "
digital first although computer-generated imagery has been a large part of the film industry for many years , this is the first notable film made entirely digitally with live actors .
only the items they touch are real .
scenes in classic movies such as star wars and raiders of the lost ark were made using the technology in the 1970s and 80s , while the combination of live actors and static sets has a spectacular heritage stretching back to king kong and gone with the wind .
sky captain uses the technology to create a vintage sci-fi aesthetic drawing on the look of 1930s and 40s serials such as flash gordon , as well as classic film noir and the pioneering futurism of fritz lang 's metropolis .
shot with high definition digital cameras , the stars are muted in soft focus to give them the textured look of black-and-white movies .
" it 's so difficult to get the effects right that you tend to celebrate every shot you get done , " said mr avnet .

while wales is regarded as at lower risk of a chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear -lrb- cbrn -rrb- attack than london , detailed emergency plans have been drawn up .
police regard major events as potential targets and cardiff was recently the scene of an anti-terrorist security operation when armed officers patrolled the city before the fa cup final at the millennium stadium .
situation around the uk in a security operation unprecedented in wales , road blocks were set up and vehicles searched in the build-up to may 's final between manchester united and millwall .
although no specific threat was made to the event itself , south wales police said the operation was in response to a heightened uk-wide alert .
as well as regular events at the 72,500-capacity millennium stadium , wales is home to sites of heavy industry , several major ports , military bases and nuclear power stations .
in south wales , heavy industry is centred on the m4 corridor , particularly around newport , cardiff and swansea bay . "
being pragmatic , there is n't the same level of risk of attack in wales as in london " superintendent lyn adams , cbrn co-ordinator in west wales , there is a major oil refinery at milford haven , while north wales is home to heavy industry on deeside and a nuclear power station at wylfa , on anglesey .
the uk 's main sea port to the republic of ireland is at holyhead .
military bases are also dotted around the country including raf st athan in south wales and raf valley on anglesey .
superintendent lyn adams , of north wales police , has been seconded to the welsh assembly government for a year as cbrn co-ordinator .
he said the overall threat to wales should not be exaggerated .
" being pragmatic , there is n't the same level of risk of attack in wales as in london , " he said .
" for impact , would a terrorist choose to attack heathrow airport , or the port of holyhead ?
" but we are confident that if there was an incident anywhere in wales , the response would be quick . "
staged attack emergency services in wales have already carried out exercises to test responses to terror attacks .
in february , wrexham was the setting for operation damaged dragon , which tested how emergency services would respond to a chemical attack .
a controlled explosion was carried out at a factory , with around 250 people taking part in the exercise .
supt adams added : " in terms of emergency services , we are quite advanced in north wales and in wales as a whole .
" there are 76-86 officers in north wales police trained in cbrn response .
" the force is now highly-specialised and well-equipped .
" plans across all agencies have been tested so they dovetail .
" for example , the airwave project , which is being rolled out in north wales , will ensure that radio communications across all the emergency services are compatible at the scene of an attack .
wales population centres -lrb- 2001 census -rrb- total : 2,903,085 cardiff : 305,353 swansea : 223,301 newport : 137,011 wrexham : 128,476 -lrb- county -rrb- " but there would never just be a local response - in a major attack there would be uk-wide involvement . "
the three welsh fire brigades have been supplied with new incident response units which carry large decontamination units .
the south wales brigade had three , with two in mid and west wales and two in the north wales brigade .
wales ' 22 councils have also drawn up their own plans to deal with attacks .
don norris , emergency planner for flintshire council , in north wales , said progress was being made on how councils would respond .
' contaminated environment ' he said : " our preparedness is better than it has been , but we still have a long way to go from a local authority perspective .
" police , fire and ambulance are ahead - they 've had a lot of training .
" the emergency services would deal with the immediate incident , the local authority 's role is to deal with what happens afterwards , like looking after evacuees and then returning the scene to normality .
" what we do n't have at the moment is the ability to deal with a contaminated environment after the event .
" if there is a chemical attack , the local authority has to clean it up . "
although the uk home office is responsible for overall cbrn response strategy , the welsh assembly government has a high level of involvement , particularly in areas such as health , which are devolved to wales .
first minister rhodri morgan chairs the wales resilience forum , on which chief officers of emergency services , local authorities and other agencies meet to discuss emergency responses .
according to former south wales police chief superintendent gerry toms , emergency planning in wales has improved in recent years .
he said : " before september 11 , if you asked me how many officers in wales were trained to deal with a chemical attack , it would have been none .
" since september 11 , 3,500 officers uk-wide have been trained to deal with a chemical , biological or chemical incident .
some will be in wales . "
mr toms , who advises on security at major events , added : " wales is no more at risk than any other part of the uk .
" but people must realise there is a uk threat and it would be foolish to be complacent .
" the reality is , an attack could happen in wales . "
