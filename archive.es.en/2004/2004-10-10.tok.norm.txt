" exceptions for certain forms of religiously motivated clothing in certain regions are out of the question , " the federal judges of the court based in leipzig , eastern germany wrote in their ruling as quoted by the magazine .
a copy of the ruling could not be obtained sunday . the author of the state legislation , law professor ferdinand kirchhof , told der spiegel that nuns ' habits were considered to be " professional uniforms " in the region and thus exempt from the religious symbols law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teacher fereshta ludin had sued baden-württemberg because she had been banned from wearing a headscarf in school germany 's highest tribunal , the constitutional court , ruled in september 2003 that baden-württemberg was wrong to forbid a muslim teacher from wearing a headscarf in the classroom . but it said germany 's 16 states could legislate independently to ban religious apparel if it was deemed to unduly influence children , which has subsequently created a patchwork quilt of varying rules throughout the country . muslim groups have fiercely criticized the bans as compromising their freedom of religious expression .
germany is home to more than three million muslims , making islam the country 's third religion . the german state laws tend stop short of limits set by controversial new legislation in neighboring france which outlaws islamic headscarves and other religious insignia in state schools outright , applying to both teachers and students . afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : multicultural symbol or gateway to fundamentalism ?
of the issues dividing europe and its muslim communities , the headscarf , or hijab , is perhaps the most controversial .
in germany , muslim teachers are fighting for their right to wear headscarves to class .
-lrb- april 21 , 2004 -rrb- dw-world : headscarf ban enforced in french schools as french officials continued their efforts to secure the release of two journalists held hostage in iraq on thursday , state schools started enforcing a ban on head scarves - the very issue that prompted the crisis .
-lrb- sept .
2 , 2004 -rrb- dw-world : opinion : will beards be banned soon too ?
the german fight over headscarves has been inappropriate and has taken up too much time .
naturally , dangers must be fought when one meets them .
but the headscarf alone does not represent such a danger .

danielle beccan was with friends in nottingham when she was shot from a car in an apparently random attack .
her mother heard gunshots and ran from the house to find her daughter slumped on the ground .
danielle died on the operating table .
a post-mortem test showed she had a single wound to the abdomen .
a police officer appealed to witnesses .
" it could have been your daughter , your son , " he said .
" these people are evil and they need to go to prison . "
nottinghamshire police , who have more than 100 officers hunting the killer , said danielle was shot at about 0030 bst on saturday in the st ann 's area of the city .
assistant chief constable sue fish said : " this is a truly wicked and callous crime .
we will work tirelessly to bring these people , who are responsible for this terrible crime , to justice assistant chief constable sue fish " we will do everything in our power to find the people responsible . "
police believe danielle spent the evening at the city 's annual goose fair with friends .
a vehicle pulled up alongside them as they walked home and as many as six shots were fired .
she died despite emergency surgery at queen 's medical centre , nottingham .
more than 30 bouquets had been placed at the scene of the shooting by saturday evening .
' mistaken identity ' a 12-year-old girl cried as she left a card and told how danielle was a " bubbly " person who attended the nearby elliott durham secondary school .
another card read : " we will all miss danielle very much .
she was a special person in everyone 's life . "
one 17-year-old local , who did not want to be named , said she had gone to see what was happening after hearing gunshots and had tried to help danielle .
she claimed she had seen a gold citroen with blacked-out windows near danielle and her friends .
more than 30 bouquets have been left where danielle was shot " i reckoned it was a case of mistaken identity because they were with a group of boys , " she said .
" i reckon they were heading to get the boys but they shot the girl instead . "
at a news conference , ms fish said danielle 's family was devastated by her death .
she denied a suggestion the area was lawless , saying : " we have worked extremely hard with local communities .
yards from home " this is the first shooting in the city for a number of months now .
" that does not make what happened this morning any better by a long chalk .
" we will work tirelessly to bring these people , who are responsible for this terrible crime , to justice . "
police believe the area was busy , as people were leaving the goose fair , off gregory boulevard and mansfield road .
you have got to come forward with information to put these people behind bars for life supt david colbeck supt david colbeck described danielle as an " innocent 14-year-old " who was not part of a gang , but had simply been out with friends .
he said : " you have got to come forward with information to put these people behind bars for life .
" it could have been your daughter , your son .
it could have been you , just walking home .
" these people are evil and they need to go to prison . "

the animals , with characteristics of both gorillas and chimpanzees , have been sighted in the north of the democratic republic of congo .
according to local villagers , the apes are ferocious , and even capable of killing lions .
a report about the mysterious creatures is published in this week 's edition of the uk magazine new scientist .
if they are a new species of primate , it could be one of the most important wildlife discoveries in decades .
the discovery of these apes " reveals just how much we still have to learn about our closest living relatives , " new scientist says .
' new ' giant ape large , black faces -lrb- like gorillas -rrb- up to two metres tall -lrb- 6.5ft -rrb- weigh 85kg-102kg -lrb- 187lb-224lb -rrb- males make nests on the ground -lrb- like gorillas -rrb- diet rich in fruit -lrb- like chimps -rrb- they stand up to two metres tall , the size of gorillas , and like gorillas , they nest on the ground , not in trees .
but they live hundreds of km away from any other known gorilla populations , and their diet is closer to that of chimpanzees .
primatologist shelly williams is thought to be the only scientist to have seen the apes .
during her visit to dr congo two years ago , she says she captured them on video and located their nests .
she describes her encounter with them : " four suddenly came rushing out of the bush towards me , " she told new scientist .
" if this had been a bluff charge , they would have been screaming to intimidate us .
these guys were quiet .
and they were huge .
they were coming in for the kill .
i was directly in front of them , and as soon as they saw my face , they stopped and disappeared . "
mystery the discovery has baffled scientists .
