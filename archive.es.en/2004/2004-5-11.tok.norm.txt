human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .
he apologized for uk soldiers ' abuses sunday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.05.2004 heidi - alpine ambassador with staying power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life is sweet in heidi 's mountain idyll there are few literary figures as well known as the orphan from the alps , heidi .
the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . -lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . -lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done .

interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .

" " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . -lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2004 opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of abuse of iraqi prisoners shocks the arab world the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .
for it is part of the " european family " that we have lately been celebrating and acclaiming so extensively .
in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .
the case of austria and right-wing politician jörg haider long ago established that this is n't meddling in another member states internal affairs -lrb- see link below -rrb- .
eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .
then we all must put up with accusations of speaking with a forked tongue and allowing a double moral standard . how , for example , can the european parliament demand countries observe human rights worldwide if it does n't condemn the same abuses carried out by its own members ?
or , how can we plausibly make efforts towards understanding , dialogue and cooperation with the islamic world , while at the same time looking away in embarrassment when from our - european - midst people are humiliated in the worst ways ? peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .
he apologized for uk soldiers ' abuses sunday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .
he apologized for uk soldiers ' abuses sunday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .

both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .

it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .

committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2004 prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners claim they were abused at the brandenburg / havel prison in eastern germany .
in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .
she has the support of brandenberg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm , who said she had his office 's " absolute trust .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 11.05.2004 fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer , left , said after meeting colin powell that those who abused prisoners " must be brought to justice . "
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .
german interior minister otto schily and justice minister brigitte zypries will also attend the meeting to discuss international efforts in the war against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany while the abuse of iraqi prisoners by american soldiers may have sparked anger in germany , evidence of similar instances of torture in a prison in eastern germany have hardly raised an outcry .

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2004 opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of abuse of iraqi prisoners shocks the arab world the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .
for it is part of the " european family " that we have lately been celebrating and acclaiming so extensively .
in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .
the case of austria and right-wing politician jörg haider long ago established that this is n't meddling in another member states internal affairs -lrb- see link below -rrb- .
eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .
then we all must put up with accusations of speaking with a forked tongue and allowing a double moral standard . how , for example , can the european parliament demand countries observe human rights worldwide if it does n't condemn the same abuses carried out by its own members ?
or , how can we plausibly make efforts towards understanding , dialogue and cooperation with the islamic world , while at the same time looking away in embarrassment when from our - european - midst people are humiliated in the worst ways ? peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2004 prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners claim they were abused at the brandenburg / havel prison in eastern germany .
in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.05.2004 german trade booming with eu candidate nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export motor has roared back to life as far as eastern europe goes .
contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . -lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .

australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .
he apologized for uk soldiers ' abuses sunday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2004 eu offers to end farm export aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture subsidies consume half of the eu 's budget .
in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2004 opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of abuse of iraqi prisoners shocks the arab world the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .
for it is part of the " european family " that we have lately been celebrating and acclaiming so extensively .
in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .
the case of austria and right-wing politician jörg haider long ago established that this is n't meddling in another member states internal affairs -lrb- see link below -rrb- .
eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .
then we all must put up with accusations of speaking with a forked tongue and allowing a double moral standard . how , for example , can the european parliament demand countries observe human rights worldwide if it does n't condemn the same abuses carried out by its own members ?
or , how can we plausibly make efforts towards understanding , dialogue and cooperation with the islamic world , while at the same time looking away in embarrassment when from our - european - midst people are humiliated in the worst ways ? peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .

both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .
german interior minister otto schily and justice minister brigitte zypries will also attend the meeting to discuss international efforts in the war against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany while the abuse of iraqi prisoners by american soldiers may have sparked anger in germany , evidence of similar instances of torture in a prison in eastern germany have hardly raised an outcry .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .

" we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . -lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .
canada , which has similar export-trade system , has said its wheat board was not up for negotiation . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu imposes tariffs on u.s. in trade dispute the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .
german interior minister otto schily and justice minister brigitte zypries will also attend the meeting to discuss international efforts in the war against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany while the abuse of iraqi prisoners by american soldiers may have sparked anger in germany , evidence of similar instances of torture in a prison in eastern germany have hardly raised an outcry .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .
german interior minister otto schily and justice minister brigitte zypries will also attend the meeting to discuss international efforts in the war against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany while the abuse of iraqi prisoners by american soldiers may have sparked anger in germany , evidence of similar instances of torture in a prison in eastern germany have hardly raised an outcry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.05.2004 german trade booming with eu candidate nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export motor has roared back to life as far as eastern europe goes .
contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . -lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2004 opinion : the eu can not remain silent on torture in iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of abuse of iraqi prisoners shocks the arab world the european union has been silent so far about the torture allegations against u.s. and uk troops in iraq .
both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .
for it is part of the " european family " that we have lately been celebrating and acclaiming so extensively .
in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .
the case of austria and right-wing politician jörg haider long ago established that this is n't meddling in another member states internal affairs -lrb- see link below -rrb- .
eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .

both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .
for it is part of the " european family " that we have lately been celebrating and acclaiming so extensively .
in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .
the case of austria and right-wing politician jörg haider long ago established that this is n't meddling in another member states internal affairs -lrb- see link below -rrb- .
eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .
then we all must put up with accusations of speaking with a forked tongue and allowing a double moral standard . how , for example , can the european parliament demand countries observe human rights worldwide if it does n't condemn the same abuses carried out by its own members ?

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2004 -pipe- 11:00 utc uk seen against verhofstadt for commission president belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt 's hopes to be given the top job in brussels as european commission president may be scuttled by british opposition .
according to belgian paper de standaard , u.k. prime minister tony blair will not accept verhofstadt as the person for the position - the two men are said to have clashed during the december summit on the eu constitution .
mr blair reportedly discussed the issue with french president jacques chirac at a meeting over the weekend in paris .
it would not be the first time london has torpedoed efforts by a belgian to become commission president .
former belgian prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's bid for the job ten years ago was vetoed by the u.k. as he was seen as too federalist .
meanwhile , according to austrian newspaper die presse , chancellor wolfgang schüssel is not on the shortlist of possible candidates for the job .
the newspaper says that external relations commissioner chris patten and european parliament president pat cox are the top runners .
however , mr patten is not supported by the french and mr cox , though popular among new member states , is seen as not having enough executive experience .
it may be that irish prime minister bertie ahern stands a chance as a compromise candidate .
france and germany are said to look upon him favourably for his handling of the constitution negotiations .
eu leaders are set to decide on a candidate in june .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .

" " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .
german interior minister otto schily and justice minister brigitte zypries will also attend the meeting to discuss international efforts in the war against terrorism . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany while the abuse of iraqi prisoners by american soldiers may have sparked anger in germany , evidence of similar instances of torture in a prison in eastern germany have hardly raised an outcry .

both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .
for it is part of the " european family " that we have lately been celebrating and acclaiming so extensively .
in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .
the case of austria and right-wing politician jörg haider long ago established that this is n't meddling in another member states internal affairs -lrb- see link below -rrb- .
eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .
then we all must put up with accusations of speaking with a forked tongue and allowing a double moral standard . how , for example , can the european parliament demand countries observe human rights worldwide if it does n't condemn the same abuses carried out by its own members ?
or , how can we plausibly make efforts towards understanding , dialogue and cooperation with the islamic world , while at the same time looking away in embarrassment when from our - european - midst people are humiliated in the worst ways ? peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .

both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .

in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .

eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .
then we all must put up with accusations of speaking with a forked tongue and allowing a double moral standard . how , for example , can the european parliament demand countries observe human rights worldwide if it does n't condemn the same abuses carried out by its own members ?

it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 11.05.2004 german trade booming with eu candidate nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export motor has roared back to life as far as eastern europe goes .
contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . -lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .

europe wants too much to be like the united states , criticized vaclav havel .
the former president of the czech republic and a leading figure in czechoslovakia 's velvet revolution of 1989 said that the eu lacks the visionary politicians that marked its beginnings directly after world war ii and that it has now reached a " critical junction " in its development .
speaking at the european policy centre in brussels on may 10 , the 68-year old outlined his view of european civilization which he said now had a " double meaning . "
on the one side , he argued , the eu is focussing on maximizing production and finding new ways of communicating , but at the same time " something very unpleasant is happening . " the eu " would like to be like the united states , " he added . short-term politicians havel criticized the current batch of eu leaders for thinking too much in the short-term .
long-term thinking and a restructuring of values which will " not necessarily be very popular " is needed .
he said that there is a gap between reality and the political elite , who try to push forward the debate on european integration by saying that citizens should identify with the eu as they do with " their families , towns , regions and countries . "
politicians should be " somebody other than a bureaucrat ... or an economist .
they should be charismatic , " the former playwright said .

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .
an ebay auction is set to start in mid-july to cast an american version of list 's movie . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

europe wants too much to be like the united states , criticized vaclav havel .

speaking at the european policy centre in brussels on may 10 , the 68-year old outlined his view of european civilization which he said now had a " double meaning . "

" the eu " would like to be like the united states , " he added . short-term politicians havel criticized the current batch of eu leaders for thinking too much in the short-term .
long-term thinking and a restructuring of values which will " not necessarily be very popular " is needed .
he said that there is a gap between reality and the political elite , who try to push forward the debate on european integration by saying that citizens should identify with the eu as they do with " their families , towns , regions and countries . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2004 eu offers to end farm export aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture subsidies consume half of the eu 's budget .
in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .
canada , which has similar export-trade system , has said its wheat board was not up for negotiation . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu imposes tariffs on u.s. in trade dispute the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.05.2004 eu offers to end farm export aid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture subsidies consume half of the eu 's budget .
in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .
canada , which has similar export-trade system , has said its wheat board was not up for negotiation . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu imposes tariffs on u.s. in trade dispute the european union has slapped trade sanctions on the united states for the first time because of a long-running dispute over unfair tax breaks for u.s. firms .

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .
an ebay auction is set to start in mid-july to cast an american version of list 's movie . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "

the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .

both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .
for it is part of the " european family " that we have lately been celebrating and acclaiming so extensively .
in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .
the case of austria and right-wing politician jörg haider long ago established that this is n't meddling in another member states internal affairs -lrb- see link below -rrb- .
eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .
then we all must put up with accusations of speaking with a forked tongue and allowing a double moral standard . how , for example , can the european parliament demand countries observe human rights worldwide if it does n't condemn the same abuses carried out by its own members ?
or , how can we plausibly make efforts towards understanding , dialogue and cooperation with the islamic world , while at the same time looking away in embarrassment when from our - european - midst people are humiliated in the worst ways ? peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

according to belgian paper de standaard , u.k. prime minister tony blair will not accept verhofstadt as the person for the position - the two men are said to have clashed during the december summit on the eu constitution .
mr blair reportedly discussed the issue with french president jacques chirac at a meeting over the weekend in paris .
it would not be the first time london has torpedoed efforts by a belgian to become commission president .
former belgian prime minister jean-luc dehaene 's bid for the job ten years ago was vetoed by the u.k. as he was seen as too federalist .
meanwhile , according to austrian newspaper die presse , chancellor wolfgang schüssel is not on the shortlist of possible candidates for the job .
the newspaper says that external relations commissioner chris patten and european parliament president pat cox are the top runners .
however , mr patten is not supported by the french and mr cox , though popular among new member states , is seen as not having enough executive experience .
it may be that irish prime minister bertie ahern stands a chance as a compromise candidate .
france and germany are said to look upon him favourably for his handling of the constitution negotiations .
eu leaders are set to decide on a candidate in june .

europe wants too much to be like the united states , criticized vaclav havel .
the former president of the czech republic and a leading figure in czechoslovakia 's velvet revolution of 1989 said that the eu lacks the visionary politicians that marked its beginnings directly after world war ii and that it has now reached a " critical junction " in its development .
speaking at the european policy centre in brussels on may 10 , the 68-year old outlined his view of european civilization which he said now had a " double meaning . "
on the one side , he argued , the eu is focussing on maximizing production and finding new ways of communicating , but at the same time " something very unpleasant is happening . " the eu " would like to be like the united states , " he added . short-term politicians havel criticized the current batch of eu leaders for thinking too much in the short-term .
long-term thinking and a restructuring of values which will " not necessarily be very popular " is needed .
he said that there is a gap between reality and the political elite , who try to push forward the debate on european integration by saying that citizens should identify with the eu as they do with " their families , towns , regions and countries . "
politicians should be " somebody other than a bureaucrat ... or an economist .
they should be charismatic , " the former playwright said .

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

the number of men admitted for treatment has almost doubled in the last decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2004 prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners claim they were abused at the brandenburg / havel prison in eastern germany .
in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .
she has the support of brandenberg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm , who said she had his office 's " absolute trust .

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .

the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .

" we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .

both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .
for it is part of the " european family " that we have lately been celebrating and acclaiming so extensively .
in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .
the case of austria and right-wing politician jörg haider long ago established that this is n't meddling in another member states internal affairs -lrb- see link below -rrb- .
eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .
then we all must put up with accusations of speaking with a forked tongue and allowing a double moral standard . how , for example , can the european parliament demand countries observe human rights worldwide if it does n't condemn the same abuses carried out by its own members ?
or , how can we plausibly make efforts towards understanding , dialogue and cooperation with the islamic world , while at the same time looking away in embarrassment when from our - european - midst people are humiliated in the worst ways ? peter philipp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .

"
german foreign minister joschka fischer , currently in washington , spoke with u.s. secretary of state colin powell about the iraqi prisoner abuse scandal , saying germany was " deeply appalled " by the mistreatment . fischer 's three-day visit to washington , which began on monday , is a further sign of improving transatlantic ties , but it comes in the wake of the widening scandal over the alleged mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by their american guards in the abu ghraib prison near baghdad . speaking to reporters after talks with powell , fischer said the united states must restore its " moral leadership " of the world by carrying out a full investigation of the abuse scandal . " we need the united states , we need the moral leadership of the united states , it is important for the west , for all of us , " he said . he said german was hoping that the various investigations and inquiries under way by american authorities would lead to the u.s. regaining its moral weight , which he said was " crucial for all us . " " those who are responsible must be brought to justice , " fischer said . as the scandal over the apparent systematic human rights abuses by u.s. forces in iraqi prisons widens with the publication of new photographs of torture , anger has been growing in germany at the perceived lapses of the american military as well as the bush administration . fischer told reporters that germany had been " really shocked and deeply appalled " by the pictures that have been released of the prisoner abuse . powell also spoke to reporters , saying he and fischer exchanged views on " how deplorable the situation is for all of us . "
he said all americans were shocked by the images just as people around the world were , adding : " we are going to get to the bottom of this and make sure that justice is done . " besides meeting with powell , fischer will meet national security adviser condoleezza rice during his visit . schily : " abuse , a serious blow " german officials have been frank in their criticism of the prisoner abuse .
interior minister otto schily and german justice minister brigitte zypries - also currently in the u.s. capital - minced no words in conveying their outrage at the torture scandal . schily told reporters the graphic photographs of american soldiers abusing naked iraqi prisoners were " a serious setback in the battle against terrorism " because they dealt a serious blow to efforts to win hearts and minds in the islamic world . " repairing the damage will pose serious difficulties , " schily said .
" this matter must be dealt with , and a clear signal must be sent .
i do n't think one can simply say one is sorry and then go back to business as usual , " schily said . zypries urged the u.s. to sign up to the international criminal court and stressed that the abuse of human rights by occupation forces in iraqi prisons demonstrated how important the battle is " for the globalization of basic rights . " treading lightly ? however , fischer is treading carefully during his visit , as it comes only two months after german chancellor gerhard schröder was invited to the white house to mend ties with u.s. president george bush .
schröder and fischer strongly opposed the u.s.-led war in iraq , angering bush and cooling relations between berlin and washington . fischer will also likely discuss rice 's plans to come to berlin in two weeks to meet with german and russian officials . while in the german capital she will also hold talks with palestinian prime minister ahmed qurei , which will be washington 's highest level contacts with the palestinian authority in almost a year .
whether fischer will play a role is unclear , but he has been seen as an honest broker between israel and the palestinians in the past . at the end of the week , fischer will take part in preparatory talks in washington for the upcoming g-8 summit in june .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . -lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .
he apologized for uk soldiers ' abuses sunday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

" a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .

he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2004 prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners claim they were abused at the brandenburg / havel prison in eastern germany .
in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .
she has the support of brandenberg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm , who said she had his office 's " absolute trust .

a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .
even in this age of fast-food celebrity , where 15 minutes of fame is an eternity , the sweet little orphan girl from the mountains remains a media star 125 years after she hit the charts . leona frommelt -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature online want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.05.2004 prisoner abuse accusations surface in eastern germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners claim they were abused at the brandenburg / havel prison in eastern germany .
in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .
she has the support of brandenberg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm , who said she had his office 's " absolute trust .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .
she has the support of brandenberg 's interior minister jörg schönbohm , who said she had his office 's " absolute trust .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .
he apologized for uk soldiers ' abuses sunday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .
since 1965 , residents have held their own heidi festival every year complete with yodeling and lots of flag waving . in her home country , however , heidi 's success came later .
" that 's because the heidi myth is actually an outsider 's look at this mountain world , " explained leimgruber .
for years , the swiss prefered the more macho william tell as their hero , although that is changing .
now heidi is being pushed as a marketing tool as never before - beginning with the new marketing slogan " from heidi land to high-tech land . "
a vacation region has been christened " heidi land " and designer houses have begun putting out heidi fashion collections . german roots heidi is indeed swiss , but her roots lie in germany , since author spyri originally wrote her book for the friederich andreas perthes publishing house in thuringia .
soon thereafter heidi made it onto the lists of literature recommended for young people . even the nazis appreciated her , who naturally had to be presented as a blond , blue-eyed " aryan " girl .
her love of country and nature were a good fit with national socialist ideology .
after the war , heidi found fans in the new federal republic , since germans were eager for depictions of a world unencumbered by the realities of postwar life .
while heidi lost her place on recommended reading lists toward the end of the 1960s , she still has legions of fans , and publishing houses keep releasing new editions of the books for new generations of young people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.05.2004 heidi - alpine ambassador with staying power großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : life is sweet in heidi 's mountain idyll there are few literary figures as well known as the orphan from the alps , heidi .
the book that tells her story is a global bestseller .
and she 's no flash in the pan - more than a century old , she 's still going strong . modern switzerland might prefer to be known for its multinational companies like nestlé or pharmaceutical giant novartis , or maybe its sparkling cities like zurich and geneva .
but what comes to many foreigners ' minds when they think of the small alpine republic is a little orphan girl from the mountains , heidi . heidi is for many synonymous with clear mountain springs , fresh air and happy , rosy-cheeked children rollicking through the meadows . johanna spyri -lrb- 1872-1901 -rrb- wrote her idyllic mountain tale back in 1879 , but even today it continues to find new readers .
it has been translated into 50 languages , from afrikaans to icelandic to vietnamese , and been filmed dozens of times over the past 70 years . big in japan in the land of the rising sun , heidi is almost a cult figure .
in 1974 , the country produced the most famous animated series made of the story , keeping very close to the original and drawing heidi and her entourage with a realism that is unusual for japanese animation .
-lrb- although they did create a little canine friend for her , josef , to better illustrate her connection with animals and the natural world . -rrb- " many japanese tourists travel to switzerland to discover heidi 's home country , " said aya domenig , a japan expert .
" they 're looking for an ideal world , a symbiosis between nature and innocence . "
many think nothing of naming their daughters after the heroine of spyri 's book , she added . the japanese animation series was a hit in europe and latin america as well , and its heroine continues to be one of the world 's leading animated figures . " heidi is as well known as coca-cola and mcdonald 's , " said walter leimgruber of the university of basel .
he has put together an exhibition running in hamburg called " heidi - myth , brand and media star . " according to him , heidi represents human yearnings for happiness and authenticity , something that is stronger than ever at the beginning of the 21st century . " the fear of loss that societal change brings about is today , in our era of globalization , as current and strongly felt as it was 120 years ago when the heidi books were first published and societies were undergoing the transition from agrarian societies to industrial ones , " said leimgruber . heidi goes to hollywood in the u.s. , a translated heidi hit the bookstores in 1899 and was an instant hit .
since then , she has never been out of print there .
not surprisingly , hollywood discovered her early on and the first silent film was made in 1920 . twentieth century fox put everyone 's sweetheart shirley temple in the title role in 1937 and watched its profits soar .
after world war ii , other heidi films lit up the big screen , an opera was produced , even a folksy musical made it to the stage . america 's own " little switzerland , " a swiss colony in wisconsin named new glarus , uses the figure of heidi as a symbol for the old country .

both germany and the eu must take decisive action against abuses of human rights - or lose credibility . german foreign minister joschka fischer will hardly give the americans a talking-to .
even so , the accusations that american soldiers tortured prisoners in iraq should be on the agenda of his current u.s. visit .
it 's certainly no easy task in view of the low mutual relations during the iraq war , and the supposed efforts made to restore the relationship since then . now as then , it must be a german foreign minister 's right - if not his duty - in friendship and resoluteness to point out to washington that employing torture contradicts declared common principles , and that it 's not enough to merely apologize . such practices must be put down , and those responsible must face the consequences .
not just some soldier here or there , but also the politicians that were n't bothered until they caught sight of the incriminating photographs , not when they ordered or at least allowed the disgraceful goings-on .
committed to moral values it would indeed be naive to assume that admonitions would have an effect in a washington whose political leadership continues to be convinced it 's fighting for good and simultaneously disregards the good in its own system .
that 's why admonishing the united states would better serve another purpose : it would demonstrate that we remain committed to the still so highly-regarded moral values of democracy . we will only prove that human dignity and human rights are more than mere words in the german constitution , if we now act decisively against the proceedings in iraq .
hats off to the swiss foreign minister who summoned the u.s. and uk ambassadors to remind them of the geneva convention . germany owes itself decisive action .
and not just towards the united states , but even more so towards britain .
for it is part of the " european family " that we have lately been celebrating and acclaiming so extensively .
in order not to lose credibility , europe must first clean up its own house .

eu must act there should - there must - be a mechanism in the european union to deal with insubordinate behavior on the part of individual member states .
otherwise , it all falls back on the community .
then we all must put up with accusations of speaking with a forked tongue and allowing a double moral standard . how , for example , can the european parliament demand countries observe human rights worldwide if it does n't condemn the same abuses carried out by its own members ?

in prisons in the former east germany , guards regularly beat and mistreated prisoners .
now reports have surfaced that in one prison in the region , that practice has continued . masked guards beating up inmates with truncheons , broken bones and heart attacks induced by physical abuse .
these are the images associated with the torture of iraqi prisoners by u.s. soldiers in the abu ghraib prison outside baghdad . but recent revelations have shown that prisoner abuse can happen much closer to home .
a regional broadcaster in eastern germany has aired claims that prisoners in a penal institution in the state of brandenburg were mistreated by guards . the news first surfaced after a regional television station , rbb , aired a film about attacks on inmates at the brandenburg / havel prison between 2001 and 2004 .
the report was based on statements by two former victims and one current inmate of the prison , who said that masked prison officers would often come into the cells in groups of three or four and rough up the prisoners with their fists and batons .
they said that some prisoners suffered broken bones and other serious injuries . " they hit me with rubber truncheons " even seriously ill inmates were n't spared by the officers , according to the prisoners interviewed . a 53-year-old russian-german inmate friedrich frank told reporters that on january 13 he banged on his cell door complaining about acute pain in his chest and demanding to see a doctor .
a paramedic checked his blood pressure and said it was normal . five masked prison officers then allegedly stormed into frank 's cell and beat him up with shields and truncheons . " i fell with my face to the ground , they just continued pushing and they hit me with rubber truncheons , " frank told rbb .
he was then handcuffed and taken to an isolation cell .
it was only on the following day that a doctor confirmed that he had had a heart attack .
bildunterschrift : brandenburg / havel prison a source close to the prison told the daily berliner zeitung that the prison authorities were aware of the inmate 's illness .
" he had just come out of the hospital a couple of weeks earlier , " said the source , who asked not to be named , and added it had been a mistake to put frank in a prison at the mercy of the guards . " in any case , a doctor should have been called or -lrb- frank -rrb- should have been taken to the prison hospital , " the source said . justice minister defends use of masks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein -lrb- left -rrb- with the director of the brandenburg / havel prison hermann wachter .
brandenburg 's justice minister barbara richstein of the opposition conservative christian democratic party has come under fire for permitting prison officers to wear masks in certain situations . " it 's normal that there 's protective gear because you can always have a prickly situation .
the officers claim that they feel the need for protection .
they were scared that the inmates would take revenge , for example , on their family members , " richstein said . however , justice ministers in other german states such as hamburg , saxony and berlin have ruled out the use of masks in prisons .
" it would be unthinkable for us , " berlin 's justice ministry spokeswoman andrea boehnke said .
at the most , security gear such as helmets , shields , protective vests and batons are on hand in the prison , she said . communist east germany 's prison brutality endures richstein has said that the prison in brandenburg , a state that was formerly part of communist east germany , has retained far more prison guards from that period than penal institutions other eastern german states , indicating that they could have continued with their notoriously brutal methods of prisoner control . local broadcaster rbb reported that the prison was infamous in east germany for its masked hit-squads , who used to terrorize inmates . richstein has now ordered a review of the prison guards from former communist east germany . " we 've been working since last week as fast as we can to clear up these possible incidents , " spokeswoman dorothee stacke told the dpa news agency . the scandal has cost several people their jobs .
a prison spokeswoman confirmed that five officers and the prison director responsible in the case of friedrich frank have been suspended from duty .
disciplinary proceedings have been opened against other prison employees .
it remains unclear whether richstein will face dismissal .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .
prime minister tony blair , whose popularity has plummeted since the iraq war , had been trying to draw attention away from iraq when the mistreatment allegations surfaced .
he apologized for uk soldiers ' abuses sunday . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer calls on u.s. to restore " moral leadership " german foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in washington on monday for a three-day visit expected to focus on developments in iraq as criticism mounts in germany over the abuse of iraqi prisoners by u.s. forces .

instead of hiring actors to play in the film , aspiring stars had to pay him to get parts . german director and producer ralf list recently cast his first movie project with a slew of amateurs .
he called it " wer ist eigentlich paul ? "
-lrb- who is paul , really ? -rrb- , but the question ought to be , " how much did paul pay ? " paul , or more accurately dominik simm , paid € 451 -lrb- $ 535 -rrb- .
the 20-year-old cook from southeastern germany won an ebay auction to get to play " paul , " the lead role , in list 's movie .
he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .

human rights organization amnesty international claimed tuesday that british soldiers killed iraqi civilians in non-threatening situations . in a report published tuesday , amnesty international documented cases of british soldiers shooting and killing civilians in iraq , including an eight-year-old girl and a guest at a wedding party , who were no threat to the troops . the human rights organization said many of the cases had not been investigated , and in those that were , the royal military police had been secretive and given families little or no information about progress . " instead of the army deciding whether to investigate itself when civilians are killed , there must be a full , impartial and civilian-led investigation into all allegations of killings by uk troops , " amnesty international uk director kate allen said in an interview with the bbc tuesday . allen said there were 37 cases in which british soldiers were thought to have killed iraqi civilians who had not threatened them .
only 18 had been investigated . the british ministry of defense did not comment on the report , saying it would respond to the allegations after it had time to examine them .
civilians killed amnesty said a witness told them that a soldier had aimed and fatally shot a girl from around 60 meters away , countering an army suggestion that the 8-year-old was killed by a warning shot .
uk soldiers also allegedly shot a 22-year-old man who was celebrating a wedding , despite a neighbor having told them them that the sounds of gunshots were part of the festivities . the report , based on research the group carried out in british-administered southern iraq in february and march , also documented political and " moral " killings .
armed groups and individuals are said to have killed dozens or even hundreds of former members of the saddam hussein 's ba 'ath party , professionals , mainly christian alcohol sellers and shopkeepers selling music and videos .
amnesty said no legal action had been taken against the killers . " we are told in the uk that southern iraq is comparatively safe and secure .
yet iraqis on the ground have painted a very different picture , " allen said .
" people live in fear of armed groups , who can strike with seeming impunity . "
further abuse amnesty international 's report is just the tip of the iceberg in a series of allegations of transgressions by uk troops in iraq .
the country has been shaken in the past week by graphic photographs and soldiers ' testimonies published in the national media suggesting that troops abused and even killed iraqi prisoners .

in an attempt to jump-start global trade talks , the european union said it was prepared to end its agricultural export subsidies .
but the move has infuriated france , the largest beneficiary of eu farm aid . the trade initiative was launched by eu agriculture commissioner franz fischler and trade commissioner pascal lamy , who said the offer to end export subsidies was conditional on reciprocity by the united states and other wealthy farming nations . " we feel that a breakthrough is possible and the eu is ready to do its part , " fischler said at an eu agriculture meeting in killarney , ireland , on monday . " this means that our international partners have to make clear that they are ready to fully match the eu on their forms of export support such as export credits , abuse of food aid or state trading enterprises . " the offer could help get world trade organization talks , which are months behind schedule after collapsing last september , back on track .
agricultural export subsidies are widely believed to hurt farmers in developing countries by keeping the prices for farm products artificially low on world markets . lamy said the eu wanted to secure a preliminary framework for wto negotiations by july .
but france , by far the largest recipient of eu farm aid , could yet try to scuttle brussels ' efforts . french agriculture minister herve gaymard said the eu officials had gone beyond their mandate with their proposal and that it was a " massive tactical mistake " to offer to end the farm subsidies .
according to the reuters news agency , lamy had " heated " discussions with french finance minister nicolas sarkozy on friday night after he informed him of the plan . positive reception paris has been a staunch defender of the eu 's much criticized agricultural aid policies , which dollop out some € 40 billion -lrb- $ 47.4 billion -rrb- to the bloc 's farmers each year .
but elsewhere in europe , the commission 's proposal met a generally positive reception . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast " the initiative is good .
this is an important signal , " said german agriculture minister renate künast , adding that the move came just in time to help the stalled trade talks .
the dutch government also said it approved of the plan . that sentiment was echoed in washington and canberra . u.s. trade representative robert zoellick said the united states had already offered to end export subsidies and said washington was ready to negotiate on other aspects of its farm aid .
australian trade minister mark vaile said the proposal showed the eu was committed to pushing trade talks forward . " a clear commitment to eliminate all export subsidies would be a major improvement for the trading system , " vaile said according to the associated press . although australia does not subsidize its agricultural exports , the eu objects to australian export monopolies that exist for wheat , sugar and barley .

he will play a loser who moves into an apartment with other gay men and comes out a winner . in addition to simm , 11 other aspiring actors won roles via ebay .
jasmin bozic , 24 , bid the most - € 9,050 - to garner the one leading female role , and another future thespian spent € 4,500 for a supporting part . list said he had the idea to auction off the roles " because of the tight funds for backing films . "
and he predicted that the film would get wide release , saying that negotiations with distributors would be completed in four or five weeks . simm , bozic and their colleagues will receive professional coaching on the set when filming begins at the end of the month , director list said .
two percent of the movie 's profits will be shared among the 24 actors , 12 more of which will be cast via ebay later in the month . list 's idea seems to have caught on , too .

contrary to popular fears that eu enlargement would bring economic disadvantages , new figures suggest that german foreign trade with the new eu members began booming even before the ten formally joined the bloc . figures released by the federal statistics office on monday indicated that the prospect of looming eu enlargement alone had considerably bolstered german foreign trade with the ten candidate countries . the wiesbaden-based statistics office said that german exports to the ten eu candidate countries soared in february this year by 10.8 percent to € 4.9 billion .
the statisticians traced the export boom in particular to germany 's flourishing trade with the czech republic , which rose by 5.7 percent , with poland by 10.8 percent and with hungary by 9.3 percent . overall german trade with eu on the upswing at the same time , imports from the eu accession countries to germany showed a similar upward trend for the same period , the authorities said . total imports rose by 13.8 percent as compared to february 2003 to € 5 billion .
in particular , imports from poland and hungary showed strong above average growth of 15.5 percent and 16.4 percent respectively . the federal statistics office underlined that total german exports to the old 15-member eu as well as the ten accession countries jumped in february by 6.7 percent to € 36.9 billion , whereas imports from these countries grew by 5.3 percent to € 56.6 billion for the same period . figures could assuage fears of eu expansion the figures bring much-needed good news on the economic front for germany amid an enduring period of gloomy economic growth forecasts , weak production and persistent unemployment .
at the same time , the statistics are expected to partially refute widespread fears in germany that eu enlargement would largely bring economic disadvantages . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder speaking on may 1 - the day the ten largely eastern european countries joined the eu - german chancellor gerhard schröder said that germany , which for many years made up the eastern border of the eu , stood to gain much from enlargement by being once again at the heart of europe .
he pointed out that economic integration between old and new members was already underway and that germany exported nearly as much to its eastern neighbors as it did to the united states . " the enlargement will not make us poorer , but rather richer , " he said .
however , he also renewed calls for harmonizing eu taxes , saying there could be no one-sided tax competition at the expense of those countries that are net contributors to the eu budget . tax and job worries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : electronics giant siemens has already moved some production to poland .
both schröder 's government and germany 's conservative opposition are worried that once the eu expands , companies will be tempted to move production facilities to eastern european countries with rock-bottom labor costs and taxes .
such a migration would undermine germany 's tax base while moving jobs abroad . german politicians are particularly sensitive to corporate tax issues , since germany has some of the highest non-wage labor costs in the world and the country borders the largest new eu member poland .
whereas the tax burden for companies in germany averages around 39 percent , poland lowered its corporate tax rate from 27 to 19 percent this year .
several other eu accession countries have even lower rates . saying nobody wanted to take away the right of the new members to encourage foreign investment , schröder has called for an eu-designated corridor to avoid destructive tax dumping .
" the future of our country can not lie in joining a merciless competition of low wages and tax rates , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : schröder : germany to benefit from eu enlargement trying to assuage fears about the european union 's imminent enlargement , german chancellor gerhard schröder on friday said germany would be one of the biggest winners when the bloc accepted 10 new members on may 1 . -lrb- may 1 , 2004 -rrb- dw-world : germany fears low eu taxes after expansion as the european union prepares to accept ten new members on may 1 , germany is growing increasingly uneasy that eastern european countries with low corporate taxes could lure away businesses .

staff at newmills post office have been dealing with non-emergency matters for the past year .
they range from handling reports of crime to witness citations .
communities which have lost local police stations have welcomed the move and the service will now spread to crail , elie and lundin links .
senior police officers are delighted at what they maintain are the excellent results and other forces are studying the ground-breaking project .
keeping villages posted each post office has a police sign to identify its status .
they will also handle business like driver documents and lost and found property .
post office spokesman , kathy jack , said : " post office branches are at the heart of every community whether they are rural or urban and they provide a vital lifeline for everyone , similar to the role of scotland 's police forces .
" we hope that this partnership is well supported by local people and believe that this initiative will help safeguard and maintain post office services in more rural communities . "
communities minister margaret curran added : " by providing police services through post offices , this scheme is making it easier for local people to access assistance when they need it .
" and there are wider benefits too .
this frees up police resources to get on with what we need them to do , making communities safer places to live and work . "
it is many years since any of these villages saw a permanent police presence peter wilson chief constable fife 's chief constable , peter wilson , insists the police-post office partnership provides a presence , access and reassurance in a practical way .
" i am delighted that fife constabulary is able to demonstrate our commitment to provide policing services across all of our communities , " he said .
" it is many years since any of these villages saw a permanent police presence , but through this effective contract with local post office branches , we are now able to provide , a presence , access and reassurance in a very practical way . "
areas that have lost their local police stations are welcoming this scheme as well .
it is also being viewed as a way of helping to guarantee a future for country sub-offices whose future might otherwise be in jeopardy .

according to vicar the reverend robert titley the lack of wind that fine june day in 2000 meant the flames stayed inside the grounds and left neighbours ' homes untouched .
and despite the blaze ripping off the roof and tearing the core out of the grade 1 listed landmark in rosendale road , west dulwich , the future is bright .
almost four years later the first phase of work , costing about £ 6m , has begun on the mammoth and specialist task of restoring it .
for some it would be hard to be positive in the face of such adversity , but mr titley believes the devastation in some ways benefited the church and the community .
" it 's rather like when an aunt dies , people rally round , " he said , " we 've had so much support . "
people who have never come to church were as shocked by the fire as any of the congregation rev robert titley the restoration in pictures mr titley was woken in the early hours of a friday morning by a passer-by who knocked on the door of the neighbouring vicarage after calling the fire brigade .
the vicar and locals could only watch as firefighters battled the blaze which was started by an electrical fault .
it threw thick smoke into the air and sent scalded pieces of bibles and hymn books for miles around .
" what was rather moving was that people who have never come to church were as shocked by the fire as any of the congregation , " mr titley said .
" it made us realise what the building meant to people , whether they passed it on their way to work everyday , or could see it from their own home , or if they came to cubs or brownies here - even if they were n't a member of the congregation .
mr titley says he looked for a benefit in the tragedy " it says something about the power of buildings - even if you never go into them . "
the church was built in 1888 from a design by george fellowes-prynne .
it was meant to be a third longer in length but because money for the victorian project ran out in 1889 .
so mr titley says current work on the west end of the building , which was never properly completed , will improve the look .
" it used to look like a kind of warehouse - not very welcoming .
in the 1970s a porch was added , but once again it was done with little money . "
' series of villages ' after the fire , the church had to host services in the local school , neighbouring churches and even the front rooms of the members of the congregation .
and standing inside the imposing shell of the building it is hard to believe that they managed to get back into the church and run some services from the crypt for a few years .
mr titley said : " the idea that london is made out of a series of villages really does seem true .
" we 've had so much help from people letting us use their halls free of charge and the sense of community is really strong . "
the fire is part if the church 's story and some of the stone and brick looks rather beautiful because it is damaged rev robert titley and this notion of pulling together continues with £ 200,000 of the £ 1m needed for the second phase of the project having already being raised .
this will include repairing art work and glass .
but not all of the fire damage is to be repaired .
mr titley explained : " the fire is part if the church 's story and some of the stone and brick looks rather beautiful because it is damaged .
" correcting it would be a bit like having unnecessary cosmetic surgery just because you are middle-aged ! "

" what was rather moving was that people who have never come to church were as shocked by the fire as any of the congregation , " mr titley said .
" it made us realise what the building meant to people , whether they passed it on their way to work everyday , or could see it from their own home , or if they came to cubs or brownies here - even if they were n't a member of the congregation .
mr titley says he looked for a benefit in the tragedy " it says something about the power of buildings - even if you never go into them . "
the church was built in 1888 from a design by george fellowes-prynne .
it was meant to be a third longer in length but because money for the victorian project ran out in 1889 .
so mr titley says current work on the west end of the building , which was never properly completed , will improve the look .

coleg gwent has announced it is to axe more than 30 jobs and drop unpopular courses .
in a letter seen by bbc wales , teachers at the college 's pontypool campus accuse managers of making a bad situation worse .
last week coleg gwent revealed that it was struggling with a budget deficit of more than £ 600,000 .
its problems have led to a round of job losses and a re-organisation of courses .
college authorities said relatively few students would be affected by the changes , which will allow shrinking resources to be spent on the kind of subjects which are most popular with students .
but now 62 staff at the pontypool campus have written a letter criticising the management for the timing of the announcement and for spending decisions which , they claim , made the situation worse . "
resources are limited and we know that funding is unlikely to improve in the short term , and we need to focus our spending where it is most effective " coleg gwent statement they have said that college governors , staff , and students alike have been kept in the dark about the plans .
and they have insisted the college 's management team should resign .
they are vowing to fight the changes , and one of the unions , natfhe , will meet on wednesday to consider calls for strike action .
in a statement , coleg gwent 's management said : " we are simply moving some subjects to other locations .
where courses are affected , we will make sure that students are able to continue their studies through to completion . "
the statement said staff , students , and the local economy would benefit if the college put more resources into courses which were in demand , like construction , for instance .
" resources are limited and we know that funding is unlikely to improve in the short term , and we need to focus our spending where it is most effective , " it added .
neil mcevoy - a lecturer at the college who is standing as a plaid cymru councillor for cardiff in the forthcoming local elections - said there had been concerns over the way money had been spent .
" they have undertaken a huge capital building programme which is costing an absolute fortune , " he said .
" on top of that , with the retirement packages and the recruitment of the chief executive , the corporate management team has spent something in the region of £ 450,000 - and the deficit is only £ 660,000 .
" what the staff at the college are saying is that they are not going to accept this .
we are 100 % united and the corporate managers should resign . "
fforwm - the association of further education colleges in wales - said it did not wish to comment on specific circumstances in individual colleges .
it said , however , that colleges in wales were facing an operating deficit of over £ 3m pounds for this financial year .
that was likely to escalate unless elwa reviewed its proposed funding allocation for the sector , which had been frozen for 2004-5 .
fforwm said it wanted to work with the new management team at elwa and was hopeful that the new funding and planning system would begin to address the funding deficit facing colleges .
last week , further education colleges in wales said they needed an extra £ 5m to head off a crisis which could lead to many more jobs being cut and courses dropped .
finance managers at 13 of the 25 institutions in wales have said they are in debt to the tune of nearly £ 3.5m.
pencoed college , near bridgend , has announced it is discontinuing under-subscribed agricultural courses from the end of this academic year .
there have been warnings that other colleges might follow gwent 's example .
swansea college has already ended a number of part-time courses .

the bbc 's frontline scotland programme has found gaps in the system of care .
it found grandparents often step in , unpaid , to look after children .
a group of grandparents is now attempting legal action claiming that , in effect , they provide the same service as foster parents and they want councils to pay them the same rates .
across scotland every year , many parents develop a serious drug habit and often social services become involved .
however frontline scotland , to be screened at 2235 bst on bbc1 scotland on tuesday , highlights a hidden army - thousands of grandparents who intervene , to care for their grandchildren .
relatives who are caring for a child should not normally receive less than other foster carers scottish executive spokesman they take charge , unpaid , to avoid the risk of the children being taken into care .
cathy mckee , a grandmother from glasgow , took over caring for her grandchildren after her own daughter - a drug addict - walked out .
she said : " it 's been a hard struggle .
if the social work department had them , it would cost them £ 2000 a week to keep them in care .
" foster parents get a good allowance and if i 'm doing the same amount of work as a foster parent then i 'm entitled to the same . "
' proper audit ' the british association of social workers is calling for the government to intervene - to judge the true scale of the problem - and provide extra cash .
spokeswoman ruth stark said : " this needs to be sorted out .
it is so patchy across scotland that it needs a proper audit and proper support from central government .
" this problem is n't going to go away and we need to be putting resources into supporting grandparents . "
a scottish executive spokesman said : " existing scottish executive guidance makes clear that relatives who are caring for a child should not normally receive less than other foster carers as the costs of caring for a child will not be different .
" however , we have recognised this is a growing concern and we are undertaking research into care by relatives to examine the issues and the experiences of kinship carers .
this will report by the end of the year . "

the government argues that allowing pubs and bars to stay open longer will help curb the binge drinking blamed for an 11 % rise in violent offences .
but the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- says alcohol and drugs are recurrent themes in violent crime .
the warning comes as acpo meets for its annual conference in birmingham .
acpo 's president chris fox told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " we can not deal with binge drinking - it is beyond police capability .
" we have to attack the behaviour . "
we are seeing this increase in drinking and binge drinking , heavy drinking to excess in large numbers " chris fox acpo president " unless we can stop young people drinking to excess in crowded clubs , the symptoms - what they do when they come out - will get worse .
" society is changing .
we are seeing this increase in drinking and binge drinking , heavy drinking to excess in large numbers . "
perception the association is also warning that the ready availability of weapons and ammunition is likely to lead to an increase in gun crime in the future .
" we are seeing an increase in the propensity to use weapons , " mr fox told today .
the warning follows the first ever detailed analysis of criminal activity in all 43 police forces in england and wales .
but acpo claims that the lack of quality information is hindering their efforts to tackle gun crime .
home secretary david blunkett is due to open tuesday 's conference which is being held along with the association of police authorities .
he is set to say that the public " remain unconvinced " that crime is actually falling .
he will also say that it is important to ensure that people feel safer as well as keeping crime rates down .
there was a real challenge to make an impact on the perception gap , he is expected to add .
mr fox also said the public needed protection from organised crime at one end of the scale and anti-social behaviour at the other .
" in order to face the challenges ahead of the changing world we need to stay one step ahead of the criminal by working together more .
have your say " de-regulating bars will only serve to inflame an already dangerous situation " phil , blackpool uk " this conference will give us time to reflect on these issues and turn thoughts into real policing actions in neighbourhoods around britain , " he added .
" we have to work in the neighbourhoods to make them safer places - but at the same time we have to learn the skills that help us investigate international crime , deal with more complex societies of different races and cultures and get other parts of society to help us , " mr fox told today .

campaigners fighting to save kent 's smallest school have suffered a setback after the county council voted to close ripple school near dover .
the decision , which has to be approved by the kent schools organisation committee , was not unexpected said council member john simmonds .
he noted that with only 35 pupils , teaching at the school is a challenge .
" our whole reasoning for this is the question of the quality of education that we are able to provide , " he said .
he also noted that the council had to consider how the school is used by the local community .
" the pity is , 1,200-odd people wrote in and 2,800 signed the petition , yet only seven local children attend the school , " he said .
the county council 's schools advisory board recommended last month that ripple school should be closed after christmas .
the education authority has said that with only 35 pupils , the primary school is not financially viable .

sealskin is back in fashion welcome to the 22nd north american fur and fashion exposition -lrb- naffem -rrb- in montreal .
naffem is north america 's oldest and biggest fur and apparel show .
it is a showcase for canada 's c $ 335m export industry .
this year the emphasis is on youth .
" a new generation of designers has re-interpreted fur , " says event organiser and vice president of the fur council of canada , alan herscovici .
" it 's lighter , sportier and more colourful . "
sealskin back in fashion the mannequins on stage show off the nunavut inuit collections .
in addition to the pricey fur jacket , other items include a number of modern looking clothes , including a delicate bustier made from ring sealskin and leather , priced at c $ 900 .
the collection was set up seven years ago as part of the nunavut government 's sealskin strategy to promote the native industry .
elisapee kilabuk is one of a growing number of inuit designers working in sealskin .
the nunavut inuit collections ' co-ordinators diane giroux and ingo moslener run workshops in a range of remote inuit communities , including iqaluit where ms kilabuk lives .
mr moslener , who is also a master furrier , has worked with sealskin for five decades .
nunavut inuit designers would like to export more fur he teaches the inuit designers modern production techniques , such as machine sewing , finishing , dyeing , processing and sizing to european quality standards .
" these are products we could sell providing the market opens up now in europe , russia , " says mr moslener .
" america is a big market but , unfortunately , that 's where it 's blocked . "
the us currently bans the import of sealskin products , though 90 % of canadian fur from other animals heads south of the border .
" i learn more tricks from -lsb- mr moslener -rsb- , like beading when i make a backpack or purse ; a lot of people like them , i get better prices , " says ms kilabuk .
one of her medium-sized , beaded rucksacks sells for c $ 250 while mittens cost c $ 150 a pair .
" i would like to sell more outside nunavut , if i 'm able , " she adds .
divided charities the canadian government 's policy of increasing the cull to up to 350,000 harp seals a year sparked a ferocious response by animal rights activists .
animal rights campaigners insist seal hunts are cruel the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- spearheaded the protest : " the most important thing we do is educate the public about the cruel origin of seal products , " says the head of ifaw 's seal campaign , rebecca aldworth .
" we urge them not to allow this product on the marketplace . "
but , the globe 's biggest animal conservation charity wwf - which has been attacked by ifaw and other activists for refusing to back their campaign - defends the hunt .
wwf has been monitoring this year 's seal hunt says the organisation 's dr robert rangely .
" it 's a well managed hunt ... right now there is no conservation issue . "
even the environmental group greenpeace , which led the anti-sealing campaigns of the 1980s , says the campaign is no longer a priority issue , though it supports ifaw and remains opposed to seal hunting .
meat not murder and yet , there are fears that the animal rights lobby could threaten native people 's livelihood .
" i 'm very worried by the damage they can do to native people like inuit seal hunters ; in just a few years they 've killed a market , " says thomas coon , the leader of the cree trappers association -lrb- cta -rrb- .
" i 'm worried they 're going to kill our economy , our culture , our way of life . "
do people like paris hilton pose a threat to traditional living ?
the cree are native to canada , a " first nation " people .
they have lived off the land in northern quebec for centuries , travelling on traditional sledges and camping out in tents .
they still do , although these days they use snowmobiles to get about .
for them , beaver and bear meat are delicacies .
muskrat and squirrel are everyday foods .
bone , sinew , fat and fur are tools , thread , fuel and clothes .
even wolf and fox meat are used as trap bait .
nothing is wasted .
mr coon blames the anti-fur movement for displacing people from the land by destroying their traditional markets .
" i see young first nation people taking their lives .
they feel they have no future , many think all there is to do is take drugs and drink alcohol , " he says .
" we must preserve our economy , our markets and keep people on the land . "
ifaw is dismissive of the argument .
" we do n't oppose native subsistence hunting , " says ms aldworth , who is particularly opposed to the non-native commercial sealing industry , but " it is an unacceptable use of real problems facing the native community to justify a trade the world despises " .
a bigger piece of the action the retail fur clothing market was worth $ 11.3bn -lrb- £ 6.37bn -rrb- in 2002-3 , registering its fifth annual rise in a row , according to the international fur trade federation .
much of that rise reflects demand for wild fur , as opposed to european farmed mink .
it is becoming increasingly popular , as reflected by a 20 % rise in wild fur prices this year .
rap stars p diddy - sean combs - and mr biggs - ronald isley - have brought out clothes ranges in coyote and fox fur .
canada remains a major player in the wild fur market .
the trade contributes c $ 800m to the canadian economy .
but at the moment , only about 3 % of that goes to native hunters and trappers .
indeed , work to promote and market native furs is opposed by some sections of the native community , in particular when commercial methods are used by hunters .

the us currently bans the import of sealskin products , though 90 % of canadian fur from other animals heads south of the border .
" i learn more tricks from -lsb- mr moslener -rsb- , like beading when i make a backpack or purse ; a lot of people like them , i get better prices , " says ms kilabuk .
one of her medium-sized , beaded rucksacks sells for c $ 250 while mittens cost c $ 150 a pair .
" i would like to sell more outside nunavut , if i 'm able , " she adds .
divided charities the canadian government 's policy of increasing the cull to up to 350,000 harp seals a year sparked a ferocious response by animal rights activists .
the international fund for animal welfare -lrb- ifaw -rrb- spearheaded the protest : " the most important thing we do is educate the public about the cruel origin of seal products , " says the head of ifaw 's seal campaign , rebecca aldworth .
" we urge them not to allow this product on the marketplace . "
but , the globe 's biggest animal conservation charity wwf - which has been attacked by ifaw and other activists for refusing to back their campaign - defends the hunt .
wwf has been monitoring this year 's seal hunt says the organisation 's dr robert rangely .
" it 's a well managed hunt ... right now there is no conservation issue . "
even the environmental group greenpeace , which led the anti-sealing campaigns of the 1980s , says the campaign is no longer a priority issue , though it supports ifaw and remains opposed to seal hunting .
meat not murder and yet , there are fears that the animal rights lobby could threaten native people 's livelihood .
" i 'm very worried by the damage they can do to native people like inuit seal hunters ; in just a few years they 've killed a market , " says thomas coon , the leader of the cree trappers association -lrb- cta -rrb- .
" i 'm worried they 're going to kill our economy , our culture , our way of life . "
the cree are native to canada , a " first nation " people .
they have lived off the land in northern quebec for centuries , travelling on traditional sledges and camping out in tents .
they still do , although these days they use snowmobiles to get about .
for them , beaver and bear meat are delicacies .
muskrat and squirrel are everyday foods .
bone , sinew , fat and fur are tools , thread , fuel and clothes .
even wolf and fox meat are used as trap bait .
nothing is wasted .
mr coon blames the anti-fur movement for displacing people from the land by destroying their traditional markets .
" i see young first nation people taking their lives .
they feel they have no future , many think all there is to do is take drugs and drink alcohol , " he says .
" we must preserve our economy , our markets and keep people on the land . "
ifaw is dismissive of the argument .
" we do n't oppose native subsistence hunting , " says ms aldworth , who is particularly opposed to the non-native commercial sealing industry , but " it is an unacceptable use of real problems facing the native community to justify a trade the world despises " .
a bigger piece of the action the retail fur clothing market was worth $ 11.3bn -lrb- £ 6.37bn -rrb- in 2002-3 , registering its fifth annual rise in a row , according to the international fur trade federation .
much of that rise reflects demand for wild fur , as opposed to european farmed mink .
it is becoming increasingly popular , as reflected by a 20 % rise in wild fur prices this year .
rap stars p diddy - sean combs - and mr biggs - ronald isley - have brought out clothes ranges in coyote and fox fur .
canada remains a major player in the wild fur market .
the trade contributes c $ 800m to the canadian economy .
but at the moment , only about 3 % of that goes to native hunters and trappers .
indeed , work to promote and market native furs is opposed by some sections of the native community , in particular when commercial methods are used by hunters .

powys local health board has confirmed that dr rudi botha - who had previously worked in powys but left in 2001 to set up a practice in norfolk - will return this week to fill the gap .
patients were told in february that their current nhs dentist - dr gaurav vij - was quitting the historic town 's only nhs practice - leaving them with the prospect of a lengthy journey to the nearest one . "
i 'm delighted someone has been found to replace dr vij because people would have faced a huge journey to the nearest nhs dentist . "

" however , the problem of a lack of dentists in wales remains a major issue and we 're faced with another problem in llanidloes as its nhs dentist is set to retire soon . "

" dr botha will be returning to machynlleth from norfolk after three years , " he said .

gaurav vij , who ran the practice from machynlleth health centre from september 2002 , left to return to his native ireland earlier this month .
it took 15 months to replace the last dentist who left the town and news of mr vij 's departure had raised fears about how long it would take for another dentist to set up .
in the meantime , people in the town had to choose between going private or making a 170-mile round-trip to the nearest nhs dentists in crickhowell and ystradgynlais .
machynlleth was the latest in a long line to fall victim to a lack of dentists - particularly in rural wales - which resulted in the welsh assembly government offering £ 50,000 ' golden hellos ' as an incentive to set up practices .

dr june mcnicholas will put her " pets on prescription " idea to the royal college of nursing annual conference in harrogate on tuesday .
the warwick university psychologist believes more hospitals and care homes should give visiting rights to animals when their owners are ill .
she said pets boosted recovery , reduced stress and provided companionship . "

dr june mcnicholas dr mcnicholas dismissed the idea that pets were a health hazard .
she said they were more likely to catch illness from humans , than the other way round .
a small number of hospitals and hospices do allow patients to meet up with their pets - but as yet it is the exception , not the norm .
dr mcnicholas suggested more institutions should consider the idea of establishing visiting rooms where patients could be reunited with their pets .
alternatively , patients could be allowed to see their pets through a window in a garden area outside the ward .

benefits research has shown that pets can have a positive effect .
men with cats and dogs have been shown to have lower blood pressure .
in one study nearly nine out of 10 breast cancer patients said their pets had provided valuable support .
and in another , pets were shown to help people come to terms with bereavement .
dr mcnicholas said there was also growing evidence that pets helped boost the immune systems of children and helped stop them getting allergies or asthma .
she also described ways in which ferrets had been used to help blind children understand movement and space .
she said nurses should be more aware of the importance of pets in people 's lives so they could play a part in their recovery .

hospital patients could receive a fillip if pets were allowed to visit , according to a psychologist .
dr june mcnicholas will put her " pets on prescription " idea to the royal college of nursing annual conference in harrogate on tuesday .
the warwick university psychologist believes more hospitals and care homes should give visiting rights to animals when their owners are ill .
she said pets boosted recovery , reduced stress and provided companionship .
i think we dismiss a lot of what is so essential in people 's lives .
dr june mcnicholas dr mcnicholas dismissed the idea that pets were a health hazard .
she said they were more likely to catch illness from humans , than the other way round .
a small number of hospitals and hospices do allow patients to meet up with their pets - but as yet it is the exception , not the norm .
dr mcnicholas suggested more institutions should consider the idea of establishing visiting rooms where patients could be reunited with their pets .
alternatively , patients could be allowed to see their pets through a window in a garden area outside the ward .
she said : " we already know that people love their pets but it can be dismissed as something like sentimentality and i think we dismiss a lot of what is so essential in people 's lives . "
benefits research has shown that pets can have a positive effect .
men with cats and dogs have been shown to have lower blood pressure .
in one study nearly nine out of 10 breast cancer patients said their pets had provided valuable support .
and in another , pets were shown to help people come to terms with bereavement .
dr mcnicholas said there was also growing evidence that pets helped boost the immune systems of children and helped stop them getting allergies or asthma .
she also described ways in which ferrets had been used to help blind children understand movement and space .
she said nurses should be more aware of the importance of pets in people 's lives so they could play a part in their recovery .

a massive building boom unparalleled anywhere is taking place - last year , half of the concrete used in construction around the world was poured into china 's cities .
and the demand for these new apartments , office blocks and skyscrapers is coming from china 's rural masses - people intent on heading to the cities along the eastern coastline of the country .
" in the next 25 years , 345 million people are going to move from the rural areas into the city areas , which is the biggest mass migration of people ever , anywhere , " guy hollis , of international real estate agents jones lang lasalle , told bbc world service 's global business programme .
" that 's really what 's driving the building boom .
so when we focus on shopping centres and office buildings , it 's actually residential that 's the big driver , because they 're urbanising .
" this happened during the industrial revolution in the last century in europe , but we tended to do it over a 150 year period .
here we 're trying to do it in 15-20 years . "
' release of repression ' one example of the extreme speed of this change is the new port at qingdao , on china 's north-east coast .
four years ago it did not even exist .
now it is one of the biggest container ports in the world .
every day ships unload vast quantities of raw materials such as iron ore and oil - materials that are going directly into the building boom - and fill up with exports from the country 's ever-expanding manufacturing industry .
meanwhile the capital city , beijing , is changing before people 's eyes , with each new building battling the next for attention .
the city , awaiting the 2008 olympic games , is undergoing an orgy of construction .
on just one building site , jianwei soho , no less than 18 towers are being built .
" under the 50 years of communist ruling , there had been very little construction - so you had this incredibly repressed energy .
when you open the lid , it comes out , " said zhang xin , the co-director of the soho city project - a town that will eventually house 50,000 people .
" that 's why we 're seeing cranes everywhere .
it 's quite different to when you see cities , even new cities like hong kong and singapore , where there has been a consistent pace of development .
" here it really is the release of a repression . "
mr hollis emphasised that the pace of construction work in china has little precedent .
but he stressed that it was not just in china 's famous cities that work was under way .
" there 's more development going on in china than anyone 's ever seen anywhere else in the world , " he said .
" when we come to china , we look at beijing and we look at shanghai - lots of people from the outside do that - but what 's actually happening in the hinterland is even more interesting .
" there 's probably more development in suzhou , which is two hours to the west of shanghai , than there is in shanghai at the moment .
but we are n't necessarily aware of that , because not everybody visits those places . "
olympic boom china has 22 " second cities " , with populations of over 2 million .
they are mostly located in the coastal belt or within 200-300 miles of it .
in each of these cities are major developments , funded by both the government and foreign direct investment .
in beijing , meanwhile , the olympic games - awarded to the city in 2008 amidst controversy over china 's human rights record - has become the main focal point of redevelopment , although the decision to regenerate was taken before the games were confirmed .
" all the development is targeted to modernise the city and basically have it ready for 2008 , " mr hollis added .
" the massive construction there is not just about the olympics - which is of course a big part of it - but it 's also about modernising the city and bringing it up to be a proper capital city . "
the huge rise in demand for new buildings , fuelling the construction work , has been in part due to some changes in policy from the country 's government .
although china remains a communist country , the pragmatic approach of its new leadership has led to , for example , a recently-declared policy allowing people to purchase a 70-year lease on their land .
bank warnings this has meant that people no longer have to worry about ownership of their property in their own lifetime .
" i would interpret that as transition - from the planned socialist economy to a market economy , " professor wen hai , of peking university , told global business .
" i believe soon we will touch the issue , becoming permanent ownership instead of a limited time . "
but there are warnings that the boom may not last as long as some are hoping .
indeed , the pace of development is so fast that the country 's government has now warned that it should be slowed .
china 's premier wen jiabao has warned that beijing is readying " forceful " steps to cool the huge surge in investment .
in particular , there are fears that local banks are lending out too much money , and may be plunged into crisis if the apartments they are funding are not filled straight away .
as a result , china 's central reserve ratio - the country does not use interest rates - has been increased from 7 to 7.5 % .
" i think there 's concern in the banking sector - and certain in the central banking authorities - with regard to the amount of money being lent to the property sector , " said barry livett , an eu adviser on china 's banking system .
" there is concern that there is a speculative boom in property going on , with too much property coming online that can not be let . "

in beijing , meanwhile , the olympic games - awarded to the city in 2008 amidst controversy over china 's human rights record - has become the main focal point of redevelopment , although the decision to regenerate was taken before the games were confirmed .
" all the development is targeted to modernise the city and basically have it ready for 2008 , " mr hollis added .
" the massive construction there is not just about the olympics - which is of course a big part of it - but it 's also about modernising the city and bringing it up to be a proper capital city . "
the huge rise in demand for new buildings , fuelling the construction work , has been in part due to some changes in policy from the country 's government .
although china remains a communist country , the pragmatic approach of its new leadership has led to , for example , a recently-declared policy allowing people to purchase a 70-year lease on their land .

but there are warnings that the boom may not last as long as some are hoping .
indeed , the pace of development is so fast that the country 's government has now warned that it should be slowed .
china 's premier wen jiabao has warned that beijing is readying " forceful " steps to cool the huge surge in investment .
in particular , there are fears that local banks are lending out too much money , and may be plunged into crisis if the apartments they are funding are not filled straight away .
as a result , china 's central reserve ratio - the country does not use interest rates - has been increased from 7 to 7.5 % .

a massive building boom unparalleled anywhere is taking place - last year , half of the concrete used in construction around the world was poured into china 's cities .
and the demand for these new apartments , office blocks and skyscrapers is coming from china 's rural masses - people intent on heading to the cities along the eastern coastline of the country .
" in the next 25 years , 345 million people are going to move from the rural areas into the city areas , which is the biggest mass migration of people ever , anywhere , " guy hollis , of international real estate agents jones lang lasalle , told bbc world service 's global business programme .
" that 's really what 's driving the building boom .
so when we focus on shopping centres and office buildings , it 's actually residential that 's the big driver , because they 're urbanising .
" this happened during the industrial revolution in the last century in europe , but we tended to do it over a 150 year period .
here we 're trying to do it in 15-20 years . "
' release of repression ' one example of the extreme speed of this change is the new port at qingdao , on china 's north-east coast .
four years ago it did not even exist .
now it is one of the biggest container ports in the world .
how china 's cities are changing in the second industrial revolution in pictures every day ships unload vast quantities of raw materials such as iron ore and oil - materials that are going directly into the building boom - and fill up with exports from the country 's ever-expanding manufacturing industry .
meanwhile the capital city , beijing , is changing before people 's eyes , with each new building battling the next for attention .
the city , awaiting the 2008 olympic games , is undergoing an orgy of construction .
on just one building site , jianwei soho , no less than 18 towers are being built .
" under the 50 years of communist ruling , there had been very little construction - so you had this incredibly repressed energy .
when you open the lid , it comes out , " said zhang xin , the co-director of the soho city project - a town that will eventually house 50,000 people .
" that 's why we 're seeing cranes everywhere .
it 's quite different to when you see cities , even new cities like hong kong and singapore , where there has been a consistent pace of development .
" here it really is the release of a repression . "
mr hollis emphasised that the pace of construction work in china has little precedent .
but he stressed that it was not just in china 's famous cities that work was under way .
" there 's more development going on in china than anyone 's ever seen anywhere else in the world , " he said .
" when we come to china , we look at beijing and we look at shanghai - lots of people from the outside do that - but what 's actually happening in the hinterland is even more interesting .
" there 's probably more development in suzhou , which is two hours to the west of shanghai , than there is in shanghai at the moment .
but we are n't necessarily aware of that , because not everybody visits those places . "
