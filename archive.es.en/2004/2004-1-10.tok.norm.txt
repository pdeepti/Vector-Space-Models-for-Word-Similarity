tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .

the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .
poland has said it favors hosting u.s. forces and according to the reuters news agency , romania has also offered the united states a choice of sites for small military bases . “ we 've identified a couple of locations .
it 's up to them to choose one or more of those , but probably -lrb- on -rrb- the black sea , ” romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said on friday . germany planning major cuts as washington attempts to restructure its forces in germany , berlin is also pushing forward with an overhaul of its own military .
german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .

many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .
the medium extended air defense system -lrb- meads -rrb- would be used to shoot down enemy aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic rockets and would cost an estimated € 7 billion . although germany is keen to restructure its armed forces to be better able to take part in military operations abroad , berlin has been repeated criticized by its nato partners that it does not spend enough on defense .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .
poland has said it favors hosting u.s. forces and according to the reuters news agency , romania has also offered the united states a choice of sites for small military bases . “ we 've identified a couple of locations .
it 's up to them to choose one or more of those , but probably -lrb- on -rrb- the black sea , ” romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said on friday . germany planning major cuts as washington attempts to restructure its forces in germany , berlin is also pushing forward with an overhaul of its own military .
german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .
a planned third order eurofighter jets could also be dramatically reduced . struck on saturday declined to comment on the reports , but in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper due to be published sunday he said he had informed military commanders that the bundeswehr budget was unlikely to be spared the government ’ s spending cuts . “ in times when we are making cuts across the board for social programs , we can ’ t just keep spending more on the bundeswehr , ” he told the newspaper . sinking troop levels struck announced last year he wants to cut the armed forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .

german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .

13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .

the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.01.2004 united states , germany plan major military restructuring großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will soon have to rely on its own armored divisions .
the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.01.2004 united states , germany plan major military restructuring großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will soon have to rely on its own armored divisions .
the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .
poland has said it favors hosting u.s. forces and according to the reuters news agency , romania has also offered the united states a choice of sites for small military bases . “ we 've identified a couple of locations .
it 's up to them to choose one or more of those , but probably -lrb- on -rrb- the black sea , ” romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said on friday . germany planning major cuts as washington attempts to restructure its forces in germany , berlin is also pushing forward with an overhaul of its own military .
german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .
a planned third order eurofighter jets could also be dramatically reduced . struck on saturday declined to comment on the reports , but in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper due to be published sunday he said he had informed military commanders that the bundeswehr budget was unlikely to be spared the government ’ s spending cuts . “ in times when we are making cuts across the board for social programs , we can ’ t just keep spending more on the bundeswehr , ” he told the newspaper . sinking troop levels struck announced last year he wants to cut the armed forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .
the medium extended air defense system -lrb- meads -rrb- would be used to shoot down enemy aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic rockets and would cost an estimated € 7 billion . although germany is keen to restructure its armed forces to be better able to take part in military operations abroad , berlin has been repeated criticized by its nato partners that it does not spend enough on defense .
currently germany spends only 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product on defense compared to a nato average of 2.5 percent . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balancing military and civilian missions in afghanistan two-hundred fifty soldiers from germany ’ s bundeswehr are stationed in the dusty brick city of kunduz .

the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .

it 's up to them to choose one or more of those , but probably -lrb- on -rrb- the black sea , ” romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said on friday . germany planning major cuts as washington attempts to restructure its forces in germany , berlin is also pushing forward with an overhaul of its own military .
german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .
a planned third order eurofighter jets could also be dramatically reduced . struck on saturday declined to comment on the reports , but in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper due to be published sunday he said he had informed military commanders that the bundeswehr budget was unlikely to be spared the government ’ s spending cuts . “ in times when we are making cuts across the board for social programs , we can ’ t just keep spending more on the bundeswehr , ” he told the newspaper . sinking troop levels struck announced last year he wants to cut the armed forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .
the medium extended air defense system -lrb- meads -rrb- would be used to shoot down enemy aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic rockets and would cost an estimated € 7 billion . although germany is keen to restructure its armed forces to be better able to take part in military operations abroad , berlin has been repeated criticized by its nato partners that it does not spend enough on defense .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .

one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .
poland has said it favors hosting u.s. forces and according to the reuters news agency , romania has also offered the united states a choice of sites for small military bases . “ we 've identified a couple of locations .
it 's up to them to choose one or more of those , but probably -lrb- on -rrb- the black sea , ” romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said on friday . germany planning major cuts as washington attempts to restructure its forces in germany , berlin is also pushing forward with an overhaul of its own military .
german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .
a planned third order eurofighter jets could also be dramatically reduced . struck on saturday declined to comment on the reports , but in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper due to be published sunday he said he had informed military commanders that the bundeswehr budget was unlikely to be spared the government ’ s spending cuts . “ in times when we are making cuts across the board for social programs , we can ’ t just keep spending more on the bundeswehr , ” he told the newspaper . sinking troop levels struck announced last year he wants to cut the armed forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .
the medium extended air defense system -lrb- meads -rrb- would be used to shoot down enemy aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic rockets and would cost an estimated € 7 billion . although germany is keen to restructure its armed forces to be better able to take part in military operations abroad , berlin has been repeated criticized by its nato partners that it does not spend enough on defense .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .

a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .
a planned third order eurofighter jets could also be dramatically reduced . struck on saturday declined to comment on the reports , but in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper due to be published sunday he said he had informed military commanders that the bundeswehr budget was unlikely to be spared the government ’ s spending cuts . “ in times when we are making cuts across the board for social programs , we can ’ t just keep spending more on the bundeswehr , ” he told the newspaper . sinking troop levels struck announced last year he wants to cut the armed forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .
the medium extended air defense system -lrb- meads -rrb- would be used to shoot down enemy aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic rockets and would cost an estimated € 7 billion . although germany is keen to restructure its armed forces to be better able to take part in military operations abroad , berlin has been repeated criticized by its nato partners that it does not spend enough on defense .

the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .
poland has said it favors hosting u.s. forces and according to the reuters news agency , romania has also offered the united states a choice of sites for small military bases . “ we 've identified a couple of locations .
it 's up to them to choose one or more of those , but probably -lrb- on -rrb- the black sea , ” romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said on friday . germany planning major cuts as washington attempts to restructure its forces in germany , berlin is also pushing forward with an overhaul of its own military .
german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .
a planned third order eurofighter jets could also be dramatically reduced . struck on saturday declined to comment on the reports , but in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper due to be published sunday he said he had informed military commanders that the bundeswehr budget was unlikely to be spared the government ’ s spending cuts . “ in times when we are making cuts across the board for social programs , we can ’ t just keep spending more on the bundeswehr , ” he told the newspaper . sinking troop levels struck announced last year he wants to cut the armed forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .
the medium extended air defense system -lrb- meads -rrb- would be used to shoot down enemy aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic rockets and would cost an estimated € 7 billion . although germany is keen to restructure its armed forces to be better able to take part in military operations abroad , berlin has been repeated criticized by its nato partners that it does not spend enough on defense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .

compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .

the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .

the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .
poland has said it favors hosting u.s. forces and according to the reuters news agency , romania has also offered the united states a choice of sites for small military bases . “ we 've identified a couple of locations .
it 's up to them to choose one or more of those , but probably -lrb- on -rrb- the black sea , ” romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said on friday . germany planning major cuts as washington attempts to restructure its forces in germany , berlin is also pushing forward with an overhaul of its own military .
german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .
a planned third order eurofighter jets could also be dramatically reduced . struck on saturday declined to comment on the reports , but in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper due to be published sunday he said he had informed military commanders that the bundeswehr budget was unlikely to be spared the government ’ s spending cuts . “ in times when we are making cuts across the board for social programs , we can ’ t just keep spending more on the bundeswehr , ” he told the newspaper . sinking troop levels struck announced last year he wants to cut the armed forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .
the medium extended air defense system -lrb- meads -rrb- would be used to shoot down enemy aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic rockets and would cost an estimated € 7 billion . although germany is keen to restructure its armed forces to be better able to take part in military operations abroad , berlin has been repeated criticized by its nato partners that it does not spend enough on defense .
currently germany spends only 1.5 percent of its gross domestic product on defense compared to a nato average of 2.5 percent . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de balancing military and civilian missions in afghanistan two-hundred fifty soldiers from germany ’ s bundeswehr are stationed in the dusty brick city of kunduz .

plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .

it 's up to them to choose one or more of those , but probably -lrb- on -rrb- the black sea , ” romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said on friday . germany planning major cuts as washington attempts to restructure its forces in germany , berlin is also pushing forward with an overhaul of its own military .
german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .
a planned third order eurofighter jets could also be dramatically reduced . struck on saturday declined to comment on the reports , but in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper due to be published sunday he said he had informed military commanders that the bundeswehr budget was unlikely to be spared the government ’ s spending cuts . “ in times when we are making cuts across the board for social programs , we can ’ t just keep spending more on the bundeswehr , ” he told the newspaper . sinking troop levels struck announced last year he wants to cut the armed forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .
the medium extended air defense system -lrb- meads -rrb- would be used to shoot down enemy aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic rockets and would cost an estimated € 7 billion . although germany is keen to restructure its armed forces to be better able to take part in military operations abroad , berlin has been repeated criticized by its nato partners that it does not spend enough on defense .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory bremen leads bundesliga at winter break business -pipe- 10.01.2004 dortmund faces cash crunch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can borussia 's players count on getting their paychecks ?
borussia dortmund , long one of germany ’ s premier soccer clubs , has had a lousy season so far .
but is the only bundesliga team listed on the stock exchange also sliding towards financial oblivion ? borussia ’ s misery this season has been both on an off the pitch .
plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

the pentagon has confirmed the united states will pull armored units from germany as it realigns its military .
separately , the german defense ministry is reportedly planning massive budget cuts for its own armed forces . a pentagon spokesman on friday confirmed the united states was planning withdraw its tanks and other heavy armor from germany in the coming years , as part of washington ’ s efforts to restructure the global deployment of its forces . the spokesman , major paul swiergosz , did not give numbers or a timeline for the withdrawal , but the wall street journal reported last week around 30,000 to 40,000 soldiers from the u.s. army ’ s 1st armored division and 1st infantry division could leave germany in 2005 or 2006 . swiergosz said undersecretary of state marc grossman , and not pentagon policy advisor douglas feith as the journal had reported , had discussed the issued with german officials in december .
“ he said some of the heavy forces might be pulled out , it 's likely , " swiergosz said according to the afp news agency . presently there are some 70,000 u.s. troops stationed in germany .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld has made no secret he would like to reshape the american military from its cold war era deployments like those in germany to smaller , more flexible units based closer to potential flashpoints in the middle east and elsewhere . u.s. officials have repeatedly said that the decision to pull forces from germany is unrelated to berlin ’ s opposition to the american-led war in iraq , and both the key u.s. airbase in ramstein and the u.s. headquarters in stuttgart are likely to largely unaffected by the redeployments . however , a number of east european nations that supported washington during the conflict are now being considered for new bases .

it 's up to them to choose one or more of those , but probably -lrb- on -rrb- the black sea , ” romanian foreign minister mircea geoana said on friday . germany planning major cuts as washington attempts to restructure its forces in germany , berlin is also pushing forward with an overhaul of its own military .
german media on saturday reported that german defense minister peter struck will announce massive cuts to the bundeswehr ’ s budget next week . citing senior bundeswehr sources , several newspapers and magazines reported struck plans to lop some € 25 billion -lrb- $ 32 billion -rrb- off the military ’ s procurement and investment budget in the coming decade .
a number of large equipment orders are likely to be affected by the decision . according to die welt and handelsblatt newspapers , germany will slash orders for a multi-role armored vehicle being developed by germany 's rheinmetall ag and britain 's gkn to 200 from the 1,100 originally intended . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurofighter the government is also likely to cuts the number of nh 90 transport helicopters and tiger combat helicopters from european aerospace firm eads eurocopter unit .
a planned third order eurofighter jets could also be dramatically reduced . struck on saturday declined to comment on the reports , but in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper due to be published sunday he said he had informed military commanders that the bundeswehr budget was unlikely to be spared the government ’ s spending cuts . “ in times when we are making cuts across the board for social programs , we can ’ t just keep spending more on the bundeswehr , ” he told the newspaper . sinking troop levels struck announced last year he wants to cut the armed forces by 30,000 to a total of 250,000 soldiers by 2010 .
many military bases will also be closed , and civilian personnel tangibly reduced as part of the cost savings . however , according to der spiegel news magazine , germany is also planning to take part in the development of a air defense system with the united states and italy .
the medium extended air defense system -lrb- meads -rrb- would be used to shoot down enemy aircraft , cruise missiles and ballistic rockets and would cost an estimated € 7 billion . although germany is keen to restructure its armed forces to be better able to take part in military operations abroad , berlin has been repeated criticized by its nato partners that it does not spend enough on defense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .
for instance , in the telecom industry you have to know where the mountains are or the buildings -lrb- to choose spots for cell phone antennae . -rrb-
or urban planning .
the camera was used for taking sharp images of ground zero in manhattan .
film-based system are not capable of doing that , so the hrsc was the only one to be used and to produce good results .
we have flown the camera on aircraft over five years now .
a company was founded by me and a few others from my former institute but this came to an abrupt end by a contrary decision of the dlr board and this was one of the reasons why i thought i should leave dlr and go back to the university .
it 's not dead yet , the idea to commercialize the hrsc , but it will certainly not be done by my former organization dlr , because it was stopped there . interview conducted by mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .
is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .

is that having any effect on your work ? not any great effect except that we will look now at the beagle landing site very early .
on jan .
9 , there will be an imaging sequence of the beagle landing site .
we will fly directly over the site and we will have highest resolution possible , that means 10 meters in the hrsc proper and about 2.3 meters per pixel in the additional , sort of tenth , channel of the hrsc , the so-called super resolution channel that is an addition to the camera proper , which functions like a magnifying glass right in the center of this swath .
there we will even have 2.3 meters per pixel , so there 's a chance to even see parts of the landing equipment , maybe the parachute or the air bags -lrb- of beagle 2 -rrb- . the camera actually has n't started this mapping of the planet yet ? no .
apart from an approach image that has gone through the media from 5.5 million kilometers away , the camera has not been switched on for real data taking .
we made a “ go , no-go ” test , that means we switched the camera on to see whether it 's still alive and it 's in very good health .
but the real imaging sequence will start with the beagle 2 landing site . how long will the entire mapping take ? the whole mission time officially is two years and we will be able to cover about 50 percent of the martian surface in that time at a resolution of 10 to 20 meters per pixel by the hrsc and a few percent of the surface in super resolution by the super resolution channel , that means around 2.3 meters resolution . what are the challenges you face ? one challenge will be to keep up with the amount of data that would be coming in .
let 's put it this way , one data take is on the order of a few giga byte of data .
compressed data , which then will have to be transferred to the earth and will be received by the big stations , the esa station in australia or by the deep space network stations of nasa and then the data will be transferred from esoc , the european space operations center , to dlr -lrb- german aerospace center -rrb- , my former institute in berlin adlershof , where some first processing of the data will be carried out .
the data will be decompressed and then raw images will be produced . what do they look like ? you will already see what there is on the surface , but not in the correct geometry necessarily , not necessarily in color , but individual swaths of the nine ccd channels will be visible .
then the data will be transferred to me here at the university , then validated and then further processed by me and will be given to the 43 co-investigators from 10 countries involved .
we have to produce certain products from the overall data , that means 3d views or digital terrain models in general terms , color images and a number of others like thematic maps or topographic maps and so on , so there will be a multitude of individual tasks .
the decompressed data will be very many gigabytes , it comes up to terabytes in the end .
that is a data amount never handled before .
so this is a huge task and one has to imagine sort of what it means in covering mars .
the total surface of mars is quite comparable to the total land surface of the earth , excluding the oceans , so it 's a huge task .
not even done for the earth .
ever .
to cover this land surface at that resolution in stereo and color . why is it such an important thing to do ? oh , scientifically it ’ s a tremendously interesting object .
mars is the most earth-like planet among the planets on the inner solar system .
mars shows signs of formally flowing water .
it may have had even oceans .
it has even now gigantic volcanoes that may be even active now , we do n't know really yet .
but they were active until a few tens of millions of years ago .
we know that already from looking at the previous images .
that means from the data one can also get time information , how old mars is .
that means looking at the images and looking at the amount of superimposed impact craters give you a means of determining even the absolute age of the surface structures .
and so the data are also important in this respect that we get the context of what happened when , how much water for instance was there , when in the martian history .
we 'll be able to extract that from the images directly . the americans with their mission right now have been producing some pictures that people have said are spectacular .
are your pictures going to be as spectacular and what 's the difference between them ? the pictures taken by the “ spirit ” camera on the ground are quite different , even up to millimeter resolution per pixel .
from the orbit we will have quite a distance , 250 km , so we will have a highest resolution of close to 2 meters .
of course we will coordinate with nasa and take highest resolution images of their landing site to see what is there in terms of geologic structures .
but you can not compare them .
they ’ re different kind of pictures , but equally spectacular . you said earlier that the mission lasts two years , how long will it take you then to evaluate the pictures and have them ready for presentation ?
the follow-up processes that produce specific higher level products will take days normally .
on jan .
13 , the real mission science phase will start and then we will plan a month ahead and of course we have a coarse plan for a two year period .
we even have a coarse plan for a four year period , because we have already talked about extending this mission for another two years .. are there any commercial uses for this camera , the data that you get ? no .
of course one can image commercial uses further down stream in the mission .
you know , 3d data are very exquisite data , so the mars fans would like to look at such data , but we are not a commercial enterprise , we will not produce such data for the commercial market , but one can imagine that in cooperation with some companies or so this could be of interest sometime downstream .
but the camera itself , the hard-ware , that is a more concrete thing .
it was planned by me and also by the board of dlr that the camera should be used commercially for earth remote sensing and for geometric applications on aircraft . what would you do with those pictures ? there is quite an industry for photographing the earth , for generating 3d models , models of the topography of the earth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.01.2004 mapping mars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard neukum hopes to produce the best map ever made of the red planet .
berlin-based planetary scientist gerhard neukum recently talked to dw-world about his plans to produce a three-dimensional map of mars with a camera mounted on european space agency ’ s mars express . the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- embarked on its first-ever mission to another planet with the mars express .
one of the orbiter 's key onboard instruments is the so-called high resolution stereo camera -lrb- hrsc -rrb- , which gerhard neukum , german scientist based at berlin ’ s free university , helped develop .
trying to find a lost lander unit beagle 2 , the hrsc took its first close-ups of the red planet on friday .
while there ’ s little hope to locate the tiny probe on the martian surface , there are still big plans for the coming years : neukum wants to use his camera to map at least half the planet at a resolution never achieved before .
dw-world recently sat down with neukum to discuss his project , its significance and possible commercial uses for the camera in the future . in laymen 's terms , what does the camera actually do ? the camera is a ccd -lrb- a charge-coupled device – a silicon chip whose surface is divided into light- sensitive pixels -rrb- camera similar in a way to commercially available systems that many people use in their daily lives to take pictures .
it 's a lense optics system , on a very large focal plain , about 14 cm wide , and there in parallel are nine ccds mounted to take individual line images of the scene through this one single optics .
there are different angles in terms of looking at the surface .
this has the advantage that one can have a stereo angle right away in flying over the scene .
and so the camera works in a way that nine individual image strips on the surface are build up in flying over mars .
in a push broom way , line images are taken and the camera moves forward on its trajectory in orbit and so the images build up in a swath , and so we will have nine individual image swaths .
since there are angles between the different swaths , you get a very good 3d impression of the surface after processing the data .
it 's not just a nice view , we 'll make very precise measurements from that and we 'll be able to interpret the data for what is there in terms of geologic structures and in terms of processes that formed the surface in the past .
and in addition to that we will have four additional swaths for color images , three of them in the normal red , yellow and blue colors that we also use on our television and one scientifically very important one in infrared that will give us very important information about the composition of the surface materials . mars express failed to contact beagle 2 so far and there is some fear that it might actually have crashed when it landed on mars .

plagued by numerous injuries , the 2002 league champion has been unable to keep up with the bundesliga ’ s best this year .
and the team ’ s mediocre performance has meant dortmund failed to qualify for the prestigious and lucrative champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . it has been widely known for months that losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 15.3 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
but few could have guessed the extent of borussia ’ s financial woes until recently . “ we ’ re in the most difficult situation since i ’ ve been in dortmund – and that ’ s january 1993 , ” borussia coach matthias sammers said last month . borrowing € 100 million ? over the bundesliga ’ s christmas break , numerous reports surfaced that borussia was looking into borrowing around € 100 million by issuing debt simply to keep the club afloat .
the securities would reportedly be backed by the future revenue generated by viewing rights over the next 12 years .
team managers have since repeatedly denied that there is a liquidity crunch in dortmund , but speculation caused by the massive borrowing plans has refused to subside . the debt issue would not be the first time borussia has creatively tried to ease its financial problems .
there was an uproar in germany last autumn when it became known that dortmund wanted to take advantage of tax breaks for employees who work at nighttime and on weekend work to trim its tax bill . several reports in the media expect the club to chalk up around € 25 million in losses this season .
according to the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung daily , a source from dortmund ’ s upper circle has said the team has already “ sold the family silverware ” and now the borrowing against as yet unseen revenue would spell the “ sale of the club ’ s future . ” general manager michael meier recently admitted borussia had been talking with an anglo-american investment group schechter & co. for the past year about possibly pursuing the debt issue , but both meier and dortmund ’ s president gerd niebaum continue to dispute that the team ’ s coffers are already empty .
“ we ’ re liquid enough to finance this season through the end , ” niebaum told the daily newspaper the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung last week . stocks down about 70 percent however , such words offer little solace to the club ’ s fans and console even less the holders of its stock , which has taken a proper beating amid all the financial gloom and doom .
since the borussia listing on the stock market in october 2000 , buyers of its shares have lost around 70 percent of their investment .
from the initial price of € 11 , the borussia stock has slumped to € 3.31 on friday . with a number of key players still injured or failing entirely to turn up for training , dortmund unfortunately can ’ t count on the sporting success that would help bring in more cash this year . “ unless there ’ s a miracle , borussia dortmund will run up gigantic losses this season , ” hypovereinsbank analyst peter thilo recently told the magazine focus money . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen leads bundesliga at winter break german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .

gangs of up to 80 men have descended on fields without permission to take part in the activity , threatening and intimidating anyone who stands in their way .
dealing with illegal hare coursing has become a regular chore for farmers in parts of bedfordshire , cambridgeshire , essex , norfolk , northamptonshire and suffolk .
the offenders - who often arrive in convoys of 15 to 20 vehicles from as far afield as kent and sussex - may also have led to a dramatic decline in brown hare numbers across the east .
the coursing often involves gambling with thousands of pounds sometimes changing hands .
how can illegal coursing be tackled ?
supt simon edens , of cambridgeshire police , believes police need more powers to deal with illegal coursers at present they have to rely on trespass and poaching acts dating back to the 1830s which do not carry powers to arrest people these laws also do not allow dogs to be seized pc danny cracknell , a norfolk police wildlife crime officer , said : " a normal group will have between three and eight cars , but for bigger events the number can increase to between 15 and 20 vehicles .
" a group of illegal hare coursers could be anything between two people and as many as 60 or 80 . "
he added : " one of the problems we have got is getting incidents reported to us .
' fear of reprisals ' " we know that fear of reprisals is a big factor among farmers . "
pc cracknell said one of the worst incidents happened in november last year when a gamekeeper was assaulted when he challenged four coursers on land near wiggenhall st mary magdalen .
he said coursing is also damaging wildlife by encouraging farmers to shoot brown hares in the region - on the grounds that offenders are not interested in areas without hares .

gangs of up to 80 men have descended on fields without permission to take part in the activity , threatening and intimidating anyone who stands in their way .
dealing with illegal hare coursing has become a regular chore for farmers in parts of bedfordshire , cambridgeshire , essex , norfolk , northamptonshire and suffolk .
the offenders - who often arrive in convoys of 15 to 20 vehicles from as far afield as kent and sussex - may also have led to a dramatic decline in brown hare numbers across the east .
the coursing often involves gambling with thousands of pounds sometimes changing hands .
how can illegal coursing be tackled ?
supt simon edens , of cambridgeshire police , believes police need more powers to deal with illegal coursers at present they have to rely on trespass and poaching acts dating back to the 1830s which do not carry powers to arrest people these laws also do not allow dogs to be seized pc danny cracknell , a norfolk police wildlife crime officer , said : " a normal group will have between three and eight cars , but for bigger events the number can increase to between 15 and 20 vehicles .
" a group of illegal hare coursers could be anything between two people and as many as 60 or 80 . "
he added : " one of the problems we have got is getting incidents reported to us .
' fear of reprisals ' " we know that fear of reprisals is a big factor among farmers . "
pc cracknell said one of the worst incidents happened in november last year when a gamekeeper was assaulted when he challenged four coursers on land near wiggenhall st mary magdalen .
he said coursing is also damaging wildlife by encouraging farmers to shoot brown hares in the region - on the grounds that offenders are not interested in areas without hares .
" we could lose brown hares from particular parts of norfolk and fenland , " he said .
i have been shot at by coursers with a catapult with metal pellets and we had a police car rammed in another case police constable barry kaufmann-wright , essex police 's wildlife officer a farmer who lives near oundle in northamptonshire , who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals , said that the situation has got steadily worse over the years .
" if we do approach these people we are offered abuse and we are threatened and our families are threatened , " he said .
police constable barry kaufmann-wright , essex police 's wildlife officer , said he had come across a number of incidents where coursers have turned violent .
" i have been shot at by coursers with a catapult with metal pellets and we had a police car rammed in another case , " he said .
" there is also a lot of intimidation .
it is frightening for people in rural areas and it increases fear of rural crime . "

health minister malcolm chisholm said the funding represented an increase of 7.25 % on this year 's figure .
he said that the record investment would lead to better services and cuts in waiting times .
but the scottish national party said ministers needed to seek long-term solutions to problems such as bed blocking and postcode prescribing .
the country 's health boards will initially receive £ 5.966bn during the financial year 2004/2005 .
a further £ 26m from the scottish executive 's change and innovation fund will be distributed later in the year .
the money will be allocated using a formula which takes account of population , deprivation levels and population levels in remote or rural areas .

funding levels for the regional boards range from the £ 22.36m received by orkney to the £ 1bn allocated to glasgow .
mr chisholm said : " these resources will enable nhs boards to recruit more nurses and doctors , use more advanced medical technology and new treatment and drugs .
" they will also support our major drive to improve the health of all scots through a range of programmes . "
but he warned : " record investment must be accompanied by real change and that is why we have introduced the nhs reform bill . "
however , snp health spokeswoman shona robison said : " we must start looking to the long term solutions to the staffing crisis , bed blocking , waiting times and waiting lists and postcode prescribing across scotland .
