nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .
many of the armies in nato 's 26 member states are still not trained or prepared for foreign deployment , complains lord robertson , the organization 's former secretary general . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures . after the botched attempt to arrest and deport radical muslim imam metin kaplan from germany , the opposition is raising new questions about the compromise reached with chancellor schröder 's government over a much-needed immigration law . edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who was part of the long-running immigration negotiations , has demanded further refinements to the compromise which is designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and work here . kaplan case a " big disgrace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne " referring to german courts ' failure to deport kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has been found guilty of inciting hate in germany and wanted in turkey for high treason , stoiber told bild am sonntag that he would only sign an immigration law " when hate-preachers like kaplan would in future face shorter trials and when such people can be deported . " stoiber criticized the handling of kaplan 's case by german officials as " one of the biggest disgraces for the security authorities in past years . " following kaplan 's sudden disappearance from cologne last week that prompted a europe-wide manhunt and embarrassed german security officials and his subsequent resurfacing , stoiber has demanded clear laws for round-the-clock surveillance of terror suspects to be included in the immigration law . conservatives for preventive detention even angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unhappy with the compromise which has watered down several tough security measures that the conservatives wanted included . in light of kaplan 's case , merkel has renewed calls for preventive detention of up to two years for terror suspects - a clause which was been left out in the proposed immigration law . " the topic has to be discussed with experts and ca n't just be swept under the carpet , " merkel said in a newspaper interview over the weekend . government unbending on compromise the proposed law however will make it easier for germany to deport religious extremists and agitators such as kaplan .
in cases where deportation would result in suspects facing torture or the death penalty in their home country , the suspect can remain in germany under tight restrictions limiting freedom of movement , communication , etc . the lack of the latter has been bedeviling kaplan 's case because there have been fears he could be tortured if he were deported to his native turkey . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has refused to bow in to further security demands by the conservatives and tighten existing measures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.05.2004 from cold war defense shield to global peacekeeper großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's latest efforts to keep the peace .
nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .
many of the armies in nato 's 26 member states are still not trained or prepared for foreign deployment , complains lord robertson , the organization 's former secretary general . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .
one condition for new states joining the eu is that they adopt all our environmental laws .
that means the standards are already in force .
it would be too expensive to create sewage treatment plants or fit missing filters overnight .
there are transitional deadlines which apply correspondingly to the restrictions on free trade . i 'm sure that the eu expansion will lead to major environmental improvement in both europe and the new member states themselves .
the only exception is that because of the division of labour with the eu market , road traffic may grow faster than levels of economic growth . environment protection is clear to see in germany .
but things have changed in the last 20 years .
protecting the earth 's climate is more complicated .
it costs more and takes longer .
how can you convince people who are more concerned with economic than environmental necessities to take an interest in renewable energy or global warming ? you have to build bridges .
we do have a basic problem with climate change .
you can see it currently in the film " the day after tomorrow . "
the point is to prevent catastrophic climatic change , not to learn from it after the event .
in the film , the u.s. president comes to realize this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental concerns are important in germany we need to create a win-win situation .
if we better insulate buildings , we all save on our heating bills - people who have built or renovated houses now understand this .
insulation programmes are very popular .
the same principle applies to much of the renewable energy sector . we made less progress when it comes to cars .
we have made success in the past few years in reducing automotive emissions .
in 2003 , the decrease was two-and-a-half percent .
but we still see that when people decide what car to buy next they go with the biggest and heaviest model . that continues to be popular .
in this case , lifestyle triumphs over reason .
there 's a lot of work left to do . the interview was conducted by dagmar engel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany makes eu deadline for co2 plans after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .

the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .
one condition for new states joining the eu is that they adopt all our environmental laws .
that means the standards are already in force .
it would be too expensive to create sewage treatment plants or fit missing filters overnight .
there are transitional deadlines which apply correspondingly to the restrictions on free trade . i 'm sure that the eu expansion will lead to major environmental improvement in both europe and the new member states themselves .
the only exception is that because of the division of labour with the eu market , road traffic may grow faster than levels of economic growth . environment protection is clear to see in germany .
but things have changed in the last 20 years .
protecting the earth 's climate is more complicated .
it costs more and takes longer .
how can you convince people who are more concerned with economic than environmental necessities to take an interest in renewable energy or global warming ? you have to build bridges .
we do have a basic problem with climate change .
you can see it currently in the film " the day after tomorrow . "
the point is to prevent catastrophic climatic change , not to learn from it after the event .
in the film , the u.s. president comes to realize this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental concerns are important in germany we need to create a win-win situation .
if we better insulate buildings , we all save on our heating bills - people who have built or renovated houses now understand this .
insulation programmes are very popular .
the same principle applies to much of the renewable energy sector . we made less progress when it comes to cars .
we have made success in the past few years in reducing automotive emissions .
in 2003 , the decrease was two-and-a-half percent .
but we still see that when people decide what car to buy next they go with the biggest and heaviest model . that continues to be popular .
in this case , lifestyle triumphs over reason .
there 's a lot of work left to do . the interview was conducted by dagmar engel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany makes eu deadline for co2 plans after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .

the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures . after the botched attempt to arrest and deport radical muslim imam metin kaplan from germany , the opposition is raising new questions about the compromise reached with chancellor schröder 's government over a much-needed immigration law . edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who was part of the long-running immigration negotiations , has demanded further refinements to the compromise which is designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and work here . kaplan case a " big disgrace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne " referring to german courts ' failure to deport kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has been found guilty of inciting hate in germany and wanted in turkey for high treason , stoiber told bild am sonntag that he would only sign an immigration law " when hate-preachers like kaplan would in future face shorter trials and when such people can be deported . " stoiber criticized the handling of kaplan 's case by german officials as " one of the biggest disgraces for the security authorities in past years . " following kaplan 's sudden disappearance from cologne last week that prompted a europe-wide manhunt and embarrassed german security officials and his subsequent resurfacing , stoiber has demanded clear laws for round-the-clock surveillance of terror suspects to be included in the immigration law . conservatives for preventive detention even angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unhappy with the compromise which has watered down several tough security measures that the conservatives wanted included . in light of kaplan 's case , merkel has renewed calls for preventive detention of up to two years for terror suspects - a clause which was been left out in the proposed immigration law . " the topic has to be discussed with experts and ca n't just be swept under the carpet , " merkel said in a newspaper interview over the weekend . government unbending on compromise the proposed law however will make it easier for germany to deport religious extremists and agitators such as kaplan .
in cases where deportation would result in suspects facing torture or the death penalty in their home country , the suspect can remain in germany under tight restrictions limiting freedom of movement , communication , etc . the lack of the latter has been bedeviling kaplan 's case because there have been fears he could be tortured if he were deported to his native turkey . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has refused to bow in to further security demands by the conservatives and tighten existing measures .

it 's a process , it 'll probably last years .
but at least there 's some momentum . " adidas flaunts social credentials even german sports good company adidas says it 's committed to ensuring its products are fairly-made .
" think of sports goods production and one immediately thinks of child labor and the like , " said frank henke , whose official title at adidas is " global director for social and environmental affairs . " henke , who heads a team of 32 experts , is responsible for making sure that adidas t-shirts and shoes are only manufactured under conditions that correspond to globally-established norms .
they make pesonal visits to factories to get a first-hand impression . " for example , we have a so-called " standards of engagements " list that we hand out to all our suppliers so that they can implement these standards on topics such as health , labor protection , environment protection and core working norms , " henke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports shoes of german sports goods maker adidas-salomon ag on display in a shop in magdeburg , eastern germany .
according to adidas around 250,000 employees work in production factories around the world for the company .
adidas ' 900 suppliers come from 50 countries , more than half of which are located in asia . long way to go despite the progress , wick however is clear that german companies still have a lot to do .
" german companies are n't pioneers here , internationally it was u.s. companies like nike and reebok that first faced the heat in the 1980s , " she said . wick says that the most important thing for companies is to allow independent investigations into factory conditions and not just carry them out themselves .
" often so-called external monitors were financial research groups commissioned by the companies - we do n't consider that as independent , " she said . she added that companies also had to consider how ever-increasing market competition was affecting the working conditions at the production sites . " global shopping practices demand that the factories , mostly located in the third world , need to supply products to the companies very quickly , often there 's a change of design and the like and so the factories demand a lot from their workers , " wick said . " on this front creating products for companies like c & a or metro has become such an intense global competition that it pushes down social standards constantly .

german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .
one condition for new states joining the eu is that they adopt all our environmental laws .
that means the standards are already in force .
it would be too expensive to create sewage treatment plants or fit missing filters overnight .
there are transitional deadlines which apply correspondingly to the restrictions on free trade . i 'm sure that the eu expansion will lead to major environmental improvement in both europe and the new member states themselves .
the only exception is that because of the division of labour with the eu market , road traffic may grow faster than levels of economic growth . environment protection is clear to see in germany .
but things have changed in the last 20 years .
protecting the earth 's climate is more complicated .
it costs more and takes longer .
how can you convince people who are more concerned with economic than environmental necessities to take an interest in renewable energy or global warming ? you have to build bridges .
we do have a basic problem with climate change .
you can see it currently in the film " the day after tomorrow . "
the point is to prevent catastrophic climatic change , not to learn from it after the event .
in the film , the u.s. president comes to realize this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental concerns are important in germany we need to create a win-win situation .
if we better insulate buildings , we all save on our heating bills - people who have built or renovated houses now understand this .
insulation programmes are very popular .
the same principle applies to much of the renewable energy sector . we made less progress when it comes to cars .
we have made success in the past few years in reducing automotive emissions .
in 2003 , the decrease was two-and-a-half percent .
but we still see that when people decide what car to buy next they go with the biggest and heaviest model . that continues to be popular .
in this case , lifestyle triumphs over reason .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .
many of the armies in nato 's 26 member states are still not trained or prepared for foreign deployment , complains lord robertson , the organization 's former secretary general . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .
many of the armies in nato 's 26 member states are still not trained or prepared for foreign deployment , complains lord robertson , the organization 's former secretary general . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures . after the botched attempt to arrest and deport radical muslim imam metin kaplan from germany , the opposition is raising new questions about the compromise reached with chancellor schröder 's government over a much-needed immigration law . edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who was part of the long-running immigration negotiations , has demanded further refinements to the compromise which is designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and work here . kaplan case a " big disgrace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne " referring to german courts ' failure to deport kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has been found guilty of inciting hate in germany and wanted in turkey for high treason , stoiber told bild am sonntag that he would only sign an immigration law " when hate-preachers like kaplan would in future face shorter trials and when such people can be deported . " stoiber criticized the handling of kaplan 's case by german officials as " one of the biggest disgraces for the security authorities in past years . " following kaplan 's sudden disappearance from cologne last week that prompted a europe-wide manhunt and embarrassed german security officials and his subsequent resurfacing , stoiber has demanded clear laws for round-the-clock surveillance of terror suspects to be included in the immigration law . conservatives for preventive detention even angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unhappy with the compromise which has watered down several tough security measures that the conservatives wanted included . in light of kaplan 's case , merkel has renewed calls for preventive detention of up to two years for terror suspects - a clause which was been left out in the proposed immigration law . " the topic has to be discussed with experts and ca n't just be swept under the carpet , " merkel said in a newspaper interview over the weekend . government unbending on compromise the proposed law however will make it easier for germany to deport religious extremists and agitators such as kaplan .
in cases where deportation would result in suspects facing torture or the death penalty in their home country , the suspect can remain in germany under tight restrictions limiting freedom of movement , communication , etc . the lack of the latter has been bedeviling kaplan 's case because there have been fears he could be tortured if he were deported to his native turkey . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has refused to bow in to further security demands by the conservatives and tighten existing measures . " nothing more will be saddled on to the compromise , " interior minister otto schily warned on sunday and said the law would now be formulated according to the compromise reached with the opposition . amnesty slams immigration compromise the compromise however has been strongly criticized by the german chapter of human rights group amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- . ai refugee expert wolfgang grenz told news agency dpa on saturday that the german immigration debate had been too strongly dominated by security concerns .
" that 's no big success when one considers that originally a modern immigration law was planned , " he said . even migration researcher dieter oberndörfer said the immigration compromise was colored by the daily business of politics .
he said he " feared a provincial fear society and a growing narrow-mindedness .

despite general belt-tightening , price is n't all that matters to german consumers .
a growing number want products that are n't made in third world sweat shops , thus forcing companies to ensure that 's the case . social campaigns in recent years have ensured that a growing number of german consumers now first reach for the " made in " label before they buy a product or avoid stores tainted by allegations of exploiting cheap labor in the third world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic hazara girl weaves a carpet in a small workshop on the outskirts of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan .

" campaigns such as the one for clean clothes have complained about poor conditions in the production factories of big german clothing companies and pointed out that it 's the companies ' responsibility to ensure the factories uphold social standards , " ingeborg wick of südwind , a research institute on the developing world told deutsche welle . giving in to social pressure little wonder then that large german retail companies , which attract attention from social campaigns on account of their mass production , are now increasingly confronted with issues of sustainability and social standards and are under pressure to avoid bad publicity that might damage their image . some of them like germany 's biggest department store operator karstadtquelle ag have even set up separate groups to deal with the topic and hired trained personnel to advise them . heinz-dieter koeppe , director of karstadtquelle 's environment and social policies , admits the company has bowed to outside pressure .
" we 've certainly done a few things thanks to pressure from social campaigns .
we would n't have done it so soon otherwise . " koeppe points out that the company has , for instance , intervened in the debate on the miserable working conditions in chinese toy factories . " here at least we 've managed to make the producers tackle the issue .
it 's now binding on the large importers to examine their local suppliers and to report about them , " koeppe said .

" german companies are n't pioneers here , internationally it was u.s. companies like nike and reebok that first faced the heat in the 1980s , " she said . wick says that the most important thing for companies is to allow independent investigations into factory conditions and not just carry them out themselves .
" often so-called external monitors were financial research groups commissioned by the companies - we do n't consider that as independent , " she said . she added that companies also had to consider how ever-increasing market competition was affecting the working conditions at the production sites . " global shopping practices demand that the factories , mostly located in the third world , need to supply products to the companies very quickly , often there 's a change of design and the like and so the factories demand a lot from their workers , " wick said .

despite general belt-tightening , price is n't all that matters to german consumers .
a growing number want products that are n't made in third world sweat shops , thus forcing companies to ensure that 's the case . social campaigns in recent years have ensured that a growing number of german consumers now first reach for the " made in " label before they buy a product or avoid stores tainted by allegations of exploiting cheap labor in the third world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic hazara girl weaves a carpet in a small workshop on the outskirts of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan .
whether it 's toys manufactured somewhere in hongkong during an 18-hour shift for near non-existent wages , skirts and jeans that come from factories where labor unions are banned , coffee bought from farmers in latin america at dumping prices or carpets from india or pakistan woven by children , social groups and ngos are tirelessly uncovering unfair working conditions and exploitation worldwide . " campaigns such as the one for clean clothes have complained about poor conditions in the production factories of big german clothing companies and pointed out that it 's the companies ' responsibility to ensure the factories uphold social standards , " ingeborg wick of südwind , a research institute on the developing world told deutsche welle . giving in to social pressure little wonder then that large german retail companies , which attract attention from social campaigns on account of their mass production , are now increasingly confronted with issues of sustainability and social standards and are under pressure to avoid bad publicity that might damage their image . some of them like germany 's biggest department store operator karstadtquelle ag have even set up separate groups to deal with the topic and hired trained personnel to advise them . heinz-dieter koeppe , director of karstadtquelle 's environment and social policies , admits the company has bowed to outside pressure .
" we 've certainly done a few things thanks to pressure from social campaigns .
we would n't have done it so soon otherwise . " koeppe points out that the company has , for instance , intervened in the debate on the miserable working conditions in chinese toy factories . " here at least we 've managed to make the producers tackle the issue .
it 's now binding on the large importers to examine their local suppliers and to report about them , " koeppe said .
" naturally , it does n't mean that we 've improved everything .
it 's a process , it 'll probably last years .
but at least there 's some momentum . " adidas flaunts social credentials even german sports good company adidas says it 's committed to ensuring its products are fairly-made .
" think of sports goods production and one immediately thinks of child labor and the like , " said frank henke , whose official title at adidas is " global director for social and environmental affairs . " henke , who heads a team of 32 experts , is responsible for making sure that adidas t-shirts and shoes are only manufactured under conditions that correspond to globally-established norms .
they make pesonal visits to factories to get a first-hand impression . " for example , we have a so-called " standards of engagements " list that we hand out to all our suppliers so that they can implement these standards on topics such as health , labor protection , environment protection and core working norms , " henke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports shoes of german sports goods maker adidas-salomon ag on display in a shop in magdeburg , eastern germany .
according to adidas around 250,000 employees work in production factories around the world for the company .
adidas ' 900 suppliers come from 50 countries , more than half of which are located in asia . long way to go despite the progress , wick however is clear that german companies still have a lot to do .
" german companies are n't pioneers here , internationally it was u.s. companies like nike and reebok that first faced the heat in the 1980s , " she said . wick says that the most important thing for companies is to allow independent investigations into factory conditions and not just carry them out themselves .
" often so-called external monitors were financial research groups commissioned by the companies - we do n't consider that as independent , " she said . she added that companies also had to consider how ever-increasing market competition was affecting the working conditions at the production sites . " global shopping practices demand that the factories , mostly located in the third world , need to supply products to the companies very quickly , often there 's a change of design and the like and so the factories demand a lot from their workers , " wick said . " on this front creating products for companies like c & a or metro has become such an intense global competition that it pushes down social standards constantly .

german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .
one condition for new states joining the eu is that they adopt all our environmental laws .
that means the standards are already in force .
it would be too expensive to create sewage treatment plants or fit missing filters overnight .
there are transitional deadlines which apply correspondingly to the restrictions on free trade . i 'm sure that the eu expansion will lead to major environmental improvement in both europe and the new member states themselves .
the only exception is that because of the division of labour with the eu market , road traffic may grow faster than levels of economic growth . environment protection is clear to see in germany .
but things have changed in the last 20 years .
protecting the earth 's climate is more complicated .
it costs more and takes longer .
how can you convince people who are more concerned with economic than environmental necessities to take an interest in renewable energy or global warming ? you have to build bridges .
we do have a basic problem with climate change .

german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .
one condition for new states joining the eu is that they adopt all our environmental laws .
that means the standards are already in force .
it would be too expensive to create sewage treatment plants or fit missing filters overnight .
there are transitional deadlines which apply correspondingly to the restrictions on free trade . i 'm sure that the eu expansion will lead to major environmental improvement in both europe and the new member states themselves .
the only exception is that because of the division of labour with the eu market , road traffic may grow faster than levels of economic growth . environment protection is clear to see in germany .
but things have changed in the last 20 years .
protecting the earth 's climate is more complicated .
it costs more and takes longer .
how can you convince people who are more concerned with economic than environmental necessities to take an interest in renewable energy or global warming ? you have to build bridges .
we do have a basic problem with climate change .
you can see it currently in the film " the day after tomorrow . "
the point is to prevent catastrophic climatic change , not to learn from it after the event .
in the film , the u.s. president comes to realize this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental concerns are important in germany we need to create a win-win situation .
if we better insulate buildings , we all save on our heating bills - people who have built or renovated houses now understand this .
insulation programmes are very popular .
the same principle applies to much of the renewable energy sector . we made less progress when it comes to cars .
we have made success in the past few years in reducing automotive emissions .
in 2003 , the decrease was two-and-a-half percent .

german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .
one condition for new states joining the eu is that they adopt all our environmental laws .
that means the standards are already in force .
it would be too expensive to create sewage treatment plants or fit missing filters overnight .
there are transitional deadlines which apply correspondingly to the restrictions on free trade . i 'm sure that the eu expansion will lead to major environmental improvement in both europe and the new member states themselves .
the only exception is that because of the division of labour with the eu market , road traffic may grow faster than levels of economic growth . environment protection is clear to see in germany .
but things have changed in the last 20 years .
protecting the earth 's climate is more complicated .
it costs more and takes longer .
how can you convince people who are more concerned with economic than environmental necessities to take an interest in renewable energy or global warming ? you have to build bridges .
we do have a basic problem with climate change .
you can see it currently in the film " the day after tomorrow . "
the point is to prevent catastrophic climatic change , not to learn from it after the event .
in the film , the u.s. president comes to realize this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental concerns are important in germany we need to create a win-win situation .
if we better insulate buildings , we all save on our heating bills - people who have built or renovated houses now understand this .
insulation programmes are very popular .
the same principle applies to much of the renewable energy sector . we made less progress when it comes to cars .
we have made success in the past few years in reducing automotive emissions .
in 2003 , the decrease was two-and-a-half percent .
but we still see that when people decide what car to buy next they go with the biggest and heaviest model . that continues to be popular .

despite general belt-tightening , price is n't all that matters to german consumers .
a growing number want products that are n't made in third world sweat shops , thus forcing companies to ensure that 's the case . social campaigns in recent years have ensured that a growing number of german consumers now first reach for the " made in " label before they buy a product or avoid stores tainted by allegations of exploiting cheap labor in the third world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic hazara girl weaves a carpet in a small workshop on the outskirts of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan .

" campaigns such as the one for clean clothes have complained about poor conditions in the production factories of big german clothing companies and pointed out that it 's the companies ' responsibility to ensure the factories uphold social standards , " ingeborg wick of südwind , a research institute on the developing world told deutsche welle . giving in to social pressure little wonder then that large german retail companies , which attract attention from social campaigns on account of their mass production , are now increasingly confronted with issues of sustainability and social standards and are under pressure to avoid bad publicity that might damage their image . some of them like germany 's biggest department store operator karstadtquelle ag have even set up separate groups to deal with the topic and hired trained personnel to advise them . heinz-dieter koeppe , director of karstadtquelle 's environment and social policies , admits the company has bowed to outside pressure .
" we 've certainly done a few things thanks to pressure from social campaigns .
we would n't have done it so soon otherwise . " koeppe points out that the company has , for instance , intervened in the debate on the miserable working conditions in chinese toy factories . " here at least we 've managed to make the producers tackle the issue .
it 's now binding on the large importers to examine their local suppliers and to report about them , " koeppe said .

" german companies are n't pioneers here , internationally it was u.s. companies like nike and reebok that first faced the heat in the 1980s , " she said . wick says that the most important thing for companies is to allow independent investigations into factory conditions and not just carry them out themselves .
" often so-called external monitors were financial research groups commissioned by the companies - we do n't consider that as independent , " she said . she added that companies also had to consider how ever-increasing market competition was affecting the working conditions at the production sites . " global shopping practices demand that the factories , mostly located in the third world , need to supply products to the companies very quickly , often there 's a change of design and the like and so the factories demand a lot from their workers , " wick said .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .
many of the armies in nato 's 26 member states are still not trained or prepared for foreign deployment , complains lord robertson , the organization 's former secretary general . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures . after the botched attempt to arrest and deport radical muslim imam metin kaplan from germany , the opposition is raising new questions about the compromise reached with chancellor schröder 's government over a much-needed immigration law . edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who was part of the long-running immigration negotiations , has demanded further refinements to the compromise which is designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and work here . kaplan case a " big disgrace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne " referring to german courts ' failure to deport kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has been found guilty of inciting hate in germany and wanted in turkey for high treason , stoiber told bild am sonntag that he would only sign an immigration law " when hate-preachers like kaplan would in future face shorter trials and when such people can be deported . " stoiber criticized the handling of kaplan 's case by german officials as " one of the biggest disgraces for the security authorities in past years . " following kaplan 's sudden disappearance from cologne last week that prompted a europe-wide manhunt and embarrassed german security officials and his subsequent resurfacing , stoiber has demanded clear laws for round-the-clock surveillance of terror suspects to be included in the immigration law . conservatives for preventive detention even angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unhappy with the compromise which has watered down several tough security measures that the conservatives wanted included . in light of kaplan 's case , merkel has renewed calls for preventive detention of up to two years for terror suspects - a clause which was been left out in the proposed immigration law . " the topic has to be discussed with experts and ca n't just be swept under the carpet , " merkel said in a newspaper interview over the weekend . government unbending on compromise the proposed law however will make it easier for germany to deport religious extremists and agitators such as kaplan .
in cases where deportation would result in suspects facing torture or the death penalty in their home country , the suspect can remain in germany under tight restrictions limiting freedom of movement , communication , etc . the lack of the latter has been bedeviling kaplan 's case because there have been fears he could be tortured if he were deported to his native turkey . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has refused to bow in to further security demands by the conservatives and tighten existing measures .

despite general belt-tightening , price is n't all that matters to german consumers .
a growing number want products that are n't made in third world sweat shops , thus forcing companies to ensure that 's the case . social campaigns in recent years have ensured that a growing number of german consumers now first reach for the " made in " label before they buy a product or avoid stores tainted by allegations of exploiting cheap labor in the third world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic hazara girl weaves a carpet in a small workshop on the outskirts of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan .
whether it 's toys manufactured somewhere in hongkong during an 18-hour shift for near non-existent wages , skirts and jeans that come from factories where labor unions are banned , coffee bought from farmers in latin america at dumping prices or carpets from india or pakistan woven by children , social groups and ngos are tirelessly uncovering unfair working conditions and exploitation worldwide . " campaigns such as the one for clean clothes have complained about poor conditions in the production factories of big german clothing companies and pointed out that it 's the companies ' responsibility to ensure the factories uphold social standards , " ingeborg wick of südwind , a research institute on the developing world told deutsche welle . giving in to social pressure little wonder then that large german retail companies , which attract attention from social campaigns on account of their mass production , are now increasingly confronted with issues of sustainability and social standards and are under pressure to avoid bad publicity that might damage their image . some of them like germany 's biggest department store operator karstadtquelle ag have even set up separate groups to deal with the topic and hired trained personnel to advise them . heinz-dieter koeppe , director of karstadtquelle 's environment and social policies , admits the company has bowed to outside pressure .
" we 've certainly done a few things thanks to pressure from social campaigns .
we would n't have done it so soon otherwise . " koeppe points out that the company has , for instance , intervened in the debate on the miserable working conditions in chinese toy factories . " here at least we 've managed to make the producers tackle the issue .
it 's now binding on the large importers to examine their local suppliers and to report about them , " koeppe said .
" naturally , it does n't mean that we 've improved everything .
it 's a process , it 'll probably last years .
but at least there 's some momentum . " adidas flaunts social credentials even german sports good company adidas says it 's committed to ensuring its products are fairly-made .
" think of sports goods production and one immediately thinks of child labor and the like , " said frank henke , whose official title at adidas is " global director for social and environmental affairs . " henke , who heads a team of 32 experts , is responsible for making sure that adidas t-shirts and shoes are only manufactured under conditions that correspond to globally-established norms .
they make pesonal visits to factories to get a first-hand impression . " for example , we have a so-called " standards of engagements " list that we hand out to all our suppliers so that they can implement these standards on topics such as health , labor protection , environment protection and core working norms , " henke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports shoes of german sports goods maker adidas-salomon ag on display in a shop in magdeburg , eastern germany .
according to adidas around 250,000 employees work in production factories around the world for the company .
adidas ' 900 suppliers come from 50 countries , more than half of which are located in asia . long way to go despite the progress , wick however is clear that german companies still have a lot to do .
" german companies are n't pioneers here , internationally it was u.s. companies like nike and reebok that first faced the heat in the 1980s , " she said . wick says that the most important thing for companies is to allow independent investigations into factory conditions and not just carry them out themselves .
" often so-called external monitors were financial research groups commissioned by the companies - we do n't consider that as independent , " she said . she added that companies also had to consider how ever-increasing market competition was affecting the working conditions at the production sites . " global shopping practices demand that the factories , mostly located in the third world , need to supply products to the companies very quickly , often there 's a change of design and the like and so the factories demand a lot from their workers , " wick said . " on this front creating products for companies like c & a or metro has become such an intense global competition that it pushes down social standards constantly .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .
many of the armies in nato 's 26 member states are still not trained or prepared for foreign deployment , complains lord robertson , the organization 's former secretary general . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures . after the botched attempt to arrest and deport radical muslim imam metin kaplan from germany , the opposition is raising new questions about the compromise reached with chancellor schröder 's government over a much-needed immigration law . edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who was part of the long-running immigration negotiations , has demanded further refinements to the compromise which is designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and work here . kaplan case a " big disgrace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne " referring to german courts ' failure to deport kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has been found guilty of inciting hate in germany and wanted in turkey for high treason , stoiber told bild am sonntag that he would only sign an immigration law " when hate-preachers like kaplan would in future face shorter trials and when such people can be deported . " stoiber criticized the handling of kaplan 's case by german officials as " one of the biggest disgraces for the security authorities in past years . " following kaplan 's sudden disappearance from cologne last week that prompted a europe-wide manhunt and embarrassed german security officials and his subsequent resurfacing , stoiber has demanded clear laws for round-the-clock surveillance of terror suspects to be included in the immigration law . conservatives for preventive detention even angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unhappy with the compromise which has watered down several tough security measures that the conservatives wanted included . in light of kaplan 's case , merkel has renewed calls for preventive detention of up to two years for terror suspects - a clause which was been left out in the proposed immigration law . " the topic has to be discussed with experts and ca n't just be swept under the carpet , " merkel said in a newspaper interview over the weekend . government unbending on compromise the proposed law however will make it easier for germany to deport religious extremists and agitators such as kaplan .
in cases where deportation would result in suspects facing torture or the death penalty in their home country , the suspect can remain in germany under tight restrictions limiting freedom of movement , communication , etc . the lack of the latter has been bedeviling kaplan 's case because there have been fears he could be tortured if he were deported to his native turkey . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has refused to bow in to further security demands by the conservatives and tighten existing measures . " nothing more will be saddled on to the compromise , " interior minister otto schily warned on sunday and said the law would now be formulated according to the compromise reached with the opposition . amnesty slams immigration compromise the compromise however has been strongly criticized by the german chapter of human rights group amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- . ai refugee expert wolfgang grenz told news agency dpa on saturday that the german immigration debate had been too strongly dominated by security concerns .
" that 's no big success when one considers that originally a modern immigration law was planned , " he said . even migration researcher dieter oberndörfer said the immigration compromise was colored by the daily business of politics .
he said he " feared a provincial fear society and a growing narrow-mindedness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.05.2004 " environmental protection is thriving in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driven by green concerns .
german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .

they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .

german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.05.2004 " environmental protection is thriving in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driven by green concerns .
german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .
one condition for new states joining the eu is that they adopt all our environmental laws .
that means the standards are already in force .
it would be too expensive to create sewage treatment plants or fit missing filters overnight .
there are transitional deadlines which apply correspondingly to the restrictions on free trade . i 'm sure that the eu expansion will lead to major environmental improvement in both europe and the new member states themselves .
the only exception is that because of the division of labour with the eu market , road traffic may grow faster than levels of economic growth . environment protection is clear to see in germany .
but things have changed in the last 20 years .
protecting the earth 's climate is more complicated .
it costs more and takes longer .
how can you convince people who are more concerned with economic than environmental necessities to take an interest in renewable energy or global warming ? you have to build bridges .
we do have a basic problem with climate change .
you can see it currently in the film " the day after tomorrow . "
the point is to prevent catastrophic climatic change , not to learn from it after the event .
in the film , the u.s. president comes to realize this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental concerns are important in germany we need to create a win-win situation .
if we better insulate buildings , we all save on our heating bills - people who have built or renovated houses now understand this .
insulation programmes are very popular .
the same principle applies to much of the renewable energy sector . we made less progress when it comes to cars .
we have made success in the past few years in reducing automotive emissions .
in 2003 , the decrease was two-and-a-half percent .
but we still see that when people decide what car to buy next they go with the biggest and heaviest model . that continues to be popular .
in this case , lifestyle triumphs over reason .
there 's a lot of work left to do . the interview was conducted by dagmar engel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany makes eu deadline for co2 plans after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .

german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .

environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .

can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .

the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .

the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures . after the botched attempt to arrest and deport radical muslim imam metin kaplan from germany , the opposition is raising new questions about the compromise reached with chancellor schröder 's government over a much-needed immigration law . edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who was part of the long-running immigration negotiations , has demanded further refinements to the compromise which is designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and work here . kaplan case a " big disgrace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne " referring to german courts ' failure to deport kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has been found guilty of inciting hate in germany and wanted in turkey for high treason , stoiber told bild am sonntag that he would only sign an immigration law " when hate-preachers like kaplan would in future face shorter trials and when such people can be deported . " stoiber criticized the handling of kaplan 's case by german officials as " one of the biggest disgraces for the security authorities in past years . " following kaplan 's sudden disappearance from cologne last week that prompted a europe-wide manhunt and embarrassed german security officials and his subsequent resurfacing , stoiber has demanded clear laws for round-the-clock surveillance of terror suspects to be included in the immigration law . conservatives for preventive detention even angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unhappy with the compromise which has watered down several tough security measures that the conservatives wanted included . in light of kaplan 's case , merkel has renewed calls for preventive detention of up to two years for terror suspects - a clause which was been left out in the proposed immigration law . " the topic has to be discussed with experts and ca n't just be swept under the carpet , " merkel said in a newspaper interview over the weekend . government unbending on compromise the proposed law however will make it easier for germany to deport religious extremists and agitators such as kaplan .
in cases where deportation would result in suspects facing torture or the death penalty in their home country , the suspect can remain in germany under tight restrictions limiting freedom of movement , communication , etc . the lack of the latter has been bedeviling kaplan 's case because there have been fears he could be tortured if he were deported to his native turkey . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has refused to bow in to further security demands by the conservatives and tighten existing measures . " nothing more will be saddled on to the compromise , " interior minister otto schily warned on sunday and said the law would now be formulated according to the compromise reached with the opposition . amnesty slams immigration compromise the compromise however has been strongly criticized by the german chapter of human rights group amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- . ai refugee expert wolfgang grenz told news agency dpa on saturday that the german immigration debate had been too strongly dominated by security concerns .
" that 's no big success when one considers that originally a modern immigration law was planned , " he said . even migration researcher dieter oberndörfer said the immigration compromise was colored by the daily business of politics .
he said he " feared a provincial fear society and a growing narrow-mindedness .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .
many of the armies in nato 's 26 member states are still not trained or prepared for foreign deployment , complains lord robertson , the organization 's former secretary general . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

despite general belt-tightening , price is n't all that matters to german consumers .
a growing number want products that are n't made in third world sweat shops , thus forcing companies to ensure that 's the case . social campaigns in recent years have ensured that a growing number of german consumers now first reach for the " made in " label before they buy a product or avoid stores tainted by allegations of exploiting cheap labor in the third world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic hazara girl weaves a carpet in a small workshop on the outskirts of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan .
whether it 's toys manufactured somewhere in hongkong during an 18-hour shift for near non-existent wages , skirts and jeans that come from factories where labor unions are banned , coffee bought from farmers in latin america at dumping prices or carpets from india or pakistan woven by children , social groups and ngos are tirelessly uncovering unfair working conditions and exploitation worldwide . " campaigns such as the one for clean clothes have complained about poor conditions in the production factories of big german clothing companies and pointed out that it 's the companies ' responsibility to ensure the factories uphold social standards , " ingeborg wick of südwind , a research institute on the developing world told deutsche welle . giving in to social pressure little wonder then that large german retail companies , which attract attention from social campaigns on account of their mass production , are now increasingly confronted with issues of sustainability and social standards and are under pressure to avoid bad publicity that might damage their image . some of them like germany 's biggest department store operator karstadtquelle ag have even set up separate groups to deal with the topic and hired trained personnel to advise them . heinz-dieter koeppe , director of karstadtquelle 's environment and social policies , admits the company has bowed to outside pressure .
" we 've certainly done a few things thanks to pressure from social campaigns .
we would n't have done it so soon otherwise . " koeppe points out that the company has , for instance , intervened in the debate on the miserable working conditions in chinese toy factories . " here at least we 've managed to make the producers tackle the issue .
it 's now binding on the large importers to examine their local suppliers and to report about them , " koeppe said .
" naturally , it does n't mean that we 've improved everything .
it 's a process , it 'll probably last years .
but at least there 's some momentum . " adidas flaunts social credentials even german sports good company adidas says it 's committed to ensuring its products are fairly-made .
" think of sports goods production and one immediately thinks of child labor and the like , " said frank henke , whose official title at adidas is " global director for social and environmental affairs . " henke , who heads a team of 32 experts , is responsible for making sure that adidas t-shirts and shoes are only manufactured under conditions that correspond to globally-established norms .
they make pesonal visits to factories to get a first-hand impression . " for example , we have a so-called " standards of engagements " list that we hand out to all our suppliers so that they can implement these standards on topics such as health , labor protection , environment protection and core working norms , " henke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports shoes of german sports goods maker adidas-salomon ag on display in a shop in magdeburg , eastern germany .
according to adidas around 250,000 employees work in production factories around the world for the company .
adidas ' 900 suppliers come from 50 countries , more than half of which are located in asia . long way to go despite the progress , wick however is clear that german companies still have a lot to do .
" german companies are n't pioneers here , internationally it was u.s. companies like nike and reebok that first faced the heat in the 1980s , " she said . wick says that the most important thing for companies is to allow independent investigations into factory conditions and not just carry them out themselves .
" often so-called external monitors were financial research groups commissioned by the companies - we do n't consider that as independent , " she said . she added that companies also had to consider how ever-increasing market competition was affecting the working conditions at the production sites . " global shopping practices demand that the factories , mostly located in the third world , need to supply products to the companies very quickly , often there 's a change of design and the like and so the factories demand a lot from their workers , " wick said .

the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures . after the botched attempt to arrest and deport radical muslim imam metin kaplan from germany , the opposition is raising new questions about the compromise reached with chancellor schröder 's government over a much-needed immigration law . edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who was part of the long-running immigration negotiations , has demanded further refinements to the compromise which is designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and work here . kaplan case a " big disgrace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne " referring to german courts ' failure to deport kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has been found guilty of inciting hate in germany and wanted in turkey for high treason , stoiber told bild am sonntag that he would only sign an immigration law " when hate-preachers like kaplan would in future face shorter trials and when such people can be deported . " stoiber criticized the handling of kaplan 's case by german officials as " one of the biggest disgraces for the security authorities in past years . " following kaplan 's sudden disappearance from cologne last week that prompted a europe-wide manhunt and embarrassed german security officials and his subsequent resurfacing , stoiber has demanded clear laws for round-the-clock surveillance of terror suspects to be included in the immigration law . conservatives for preventive detention even angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unhappy with the compromise which has watered down several tough security measures that the conservatives wanted included . in light of kaplan 's case , merkel has renewed calls for preventive detention of up to two years for terror suspects - a clause which was been left out in the proposed immigration law . " the topic has to be discussed with experts and ca n't just be swept under the carpet , " merkel said in a newspaper interview over the weekend . government unbending on compromise the proposed law however will make it easier for germany to deport religious extremists and agitators such as kaplan .
in cases where deportation would result in suspects facing torture or the death penalty in their home country , the suspect can remain in germany under tight restrictions limiting freedom of movement , communication , etc . the lack of the latter has been bedeviling kaplan 's case because there have been fears he could be tortured if he were deported to his native turkey . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has refused to bow in to further security demands by the conservatives and tighten existing measures . " nothing more will be saddled on to the compromise , " interior minister otto schily warned on sunday and said the law would now be formulated according to the compromise reached with the opposition . amnesty slams immigration compromise the compromise however has been strongly criticized by the german chapter of human rights group amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- . ai refugee expert wolfgang grenz told news agency dpa on saturday that the german immigration debate had been too strongly dominated by security concerns .
" that 's no big success when one considers that originally a modern immigration law was planned , " he said . even migration researcher dieter oberndörfer said the immigration compromise was colored by the daily business of politics .
he said he " feared a provincial fear society and a growing narrow-mindedness .

despite general belt-tightening , price is n't all that matters to german consumers .
a growing number want products that are n't made in third world sweat shops , thus forcing companies to ensure that 's the case . social campaigns in recent years have ensured that a growing number of german consumers now first reach for the " made in " label before they buy a product or avoid stores tainted by allegations of exploiting cheap labor in the third world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic hazara girl weaves a carpet in a small workshop on the outskirts of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan .
whether it 's toys manufactured somewhere in hongkong during an 18-hour shift for near non-existent wages , skirts and jeans that come from factories where labor unions are banned , coffee bought from farmers in latin america at dumping prices or carpets from india or pakistan woven by children , social groups and ngos are tirelessly uncovering unfair working conditions and exploitation worldwide . " campaigns such as the one for clean clothes have complained about poor conditions in the production factories of big german clothing companies and pointed out that it 's the companies ' responsibility to ensure the factories uphold social standards , " ingeborg wick of südwind , a research institute on the developing world told deutsche welle . giving in to social pressure little wonder then that large german retail companies , which attract attention from social campaigns on account of their mass production , are now increasingly confronted with issues of sustainability and social standards and are under pressure to avoid bad publicity that might damage their image . some of them like germany 's biggest department store operator karstadtquelle ag have even set up separate groups to deal with the topic and hired trained personnel to advise them . heinz-dieter koeppe , director of karstadtquelle 's environment and social policies , admits the company has bowed to outside pressure .
" we 've certainly done a few things thanks to pressure from social campaigns .
we would n't have done it so soon otherwise . " koeppe points out that the company has , for instance , intervened in the debate on the miserable working conditions in chinese toy factories . " here at least we 've managed to make the producers tackle the issue .
it 's now binding on the large importers to examine their local suppliers and to report about them , " koeppe said .
" naturally , it does n't mean that we 've improved everything .
it 's a process , it 'll probably last years .
but at least there 's some momentum . " adidas flaunts social credentials even german sports good company adidas says it 's committed to ensuring its products are fairly-made .
" think of sports goods production and one immediately thinks of child labor and the like , " said frank henke , whose official title at adidas is " global director for social and environmental affairs . " henke , who heads a team of 32 experts , is responsible for making sure that adidas t-shirts and shoes are only manufactured under conditions that correspond to globally-established norms .
they make pesonal visits to factories to get a first-hand impression . " for example , we have a so-called " standards of engagements " list that we hand out to all our suppliers so that they can implement these standards on topics such as health , labor protection , environment protection and core working norms , " henke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports shoes of german sports goods maker adidas-salomon ag on display in a shop in magdeburg , eastern germany .
according to adidas around 250,000 employees work in production factories around the world for the company .
adidas ' 900 suppliers come from 50 countries , more than half of which are located in asia . long way to go despite the progress , wick however is clear that german companies still have a lot to do .
" german companies are n't pioneers here , internationally it was u.s. companies like nike and reebok that first faced the heat in the 1980s , " she said . wick says that the most important thing for companies is to allow independent investigations into factory conditions and not just carry them out themselves .
" often so-called external monitors were financial research groups commissioned by the companies - we do n't consider that as independent , " she said . she added that companies also had to consider how ever-increasing market competition was affecting the working conditions at the production sites . " global shopping practices demand that the factories , mostly located in the third world , need to supply products to the companies very quickly , often there 's a change of design and the like and so the factories demand a lot from their workers , " wick said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.05.2004 " environmental protection is thriving in germany " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driven by green concerns .
german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .
one condition for new states joining the eu is that they adopt all our environmental laws .
that means the standards are already in force .
it would be too expensive to create sewage treatment plants or fit missing filters overnight .
there are transitional deadlines which apply correspondingly to the restrictions on free trade . i 'm sure that the eu expansion will lead to major environmental improvement in both europe and the new member states themselves .
the only exception is that because of the division of labour with the eu market , road traffic may grow faster than levels of economic growth . environment protection is clear to see in germany .
but things have changed in the last 20 years .
protecting the earth 's climate is more complicated .
it costs more and takes longer .
how can you convince people who are more concerned with economic than environmental necessities to take an interest in renewable energy or global warming ? you have to build bridges .
we do have a basic problem with climate change .
you can see it currently in the film " the day after tomorrow . "
the point is to prevent catastrophic climatic change , not to learn from it after the event .
in the film , the u.s. president comes to realize this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental concerns are important in germany we need to create a win-win situation .
if we better insulate buildings , we all save on our heating bills - people who have built or renovated houses now understand this .
insulation programmes are very popular .
the same principle applies to much of the renewable energy sector . we made less progress when it comes to cars .
we have made success in the past few years in reducing automotive emissions .
in 2003 , the decrease was two-and-a-half percent .
but we still see that when people decide what car to buy next they go with the biggest and heaviest model . that continues to be popular .
in this case , lifestyle triumphs over reason .
there 's a lot of work left to do . the interview was conducted by dagmar engel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany makes eu deadline for co2 plans after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.05.2004 from cold war defense shield to global peacekeeper großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato 's latest efforts to keep the peace .
nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .

the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .

afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .

despite general belt-tightening , price is n't all that matters to german consumers .
a growing number want products that are n't made in third world sweat shops , thus forcing companies to ensure that 's the case . social campaigns in recent years have ensured that a growing number of german consumers now first reach for the " made in " label before they buy a product or avoid stores tainted by allegations of exploiting cheap labor in the third world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic hazara girl weaves a carpet in a small workshop on the outskirts of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan .
whether it 's toys manufactured somewhere in hongkong during an 18-hour shift for near non-existent wages , skirts and jeans that come from factories where labor unions are banned , coffee bought from farmers in latin america at dumping prices or carpets from india or pakistan woven by children , social groups and ngos are tirelessly uncovering unfair working conditions and exploitation worldwide . " campaigns such as the one for clean clothes have complained about poor conditions in the production factories of big german clothing companies and pointed out that it 's the companies ' responsibility to ensure the factories uphold social standards , " ingeborg wick of südwind , a research institute on the developing world told deutsche welle . giving in to social pressure little wonder then that large german retail companies , which attract attention from social campaigns on account of their mass production , are now increasingly confronted with issues of sustainability and social standards and are under pressure to avoid bad publicity that might damage their image . some of them like germany 's biggest department store operator karstadtquelle ag have even set up separate groups to deal with the topic and hired trained personnel to advise them . heinz-dieter koeppe , director of karstadtquelle 's environment and social policies , admits the company has bowed to outside pressure .
" we 've certainly done a few things thanks to pressure from social campaigns .
we would n't have done it so soon otherwise . " koeppe points out that the company has , for instance , intervened in the debate on the miserable working conditions in chinese toy factories . " here at least we 've managed to make the producers tackle the issue .
it 's now binding on the large importers to examine their local suppliers and to report about them , " koeppe said .
" naturally , it does n't mean that we 've improved everything .
it 's a process , it 'll probably last years .
but at least there 's some momentum . " adidas flaunts social credentials even german sports good company adidas says it 's committed to ensuring its products are fairly-made .
" think of sports goods production and one immediately thinks of child labor and the like , " said frank henke , whose official title at adidas is " global director for social and environmental affairs . " henke , who heads a team of 32 experts , is responsible for making sure that adidas t-shirts and shoes are only manufactured under conditions that correspond to globally-established norms .
they make pesonal visits to factories to get a first-hand impression . " for example , we have a so-called " standards of engagements " list that we hand out to all our suppliers so that they can implement these standards on topics such as health , labor protection , environment protection and core working norms , " henke said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sports shoes of german sports goods maker adidas-salomon ag on display in a shop in magdeburg , eastern germany .
according to adidas around 250,000 employees work in production factories around the world for the company .
adidas ' 900 suppliers come from 50 countries , more than half of which are located in asia . long way to go despite the progress , wick however is clear that german companies still have a lot to do .
" german companies are n't pioneers here , internationally it was u.s. companies like nike and reebok that first faced the heat in the 1980s , " she said . wick says that the most important thing for companies is to allow independent investigations into factory conditions and not just carry them out themselves .
" often so-called external monitors were financial research groups commissioned by the companies - we do n't consider that as independent , " she said . she added that companies also had to consider how ever-increasing market competition was affecting the working conditions at the production sites . " global shopping practices demand that the factories , mostly located in the third world , need to supply products to the companies very quickly , often there 's a change of design and the like and so the factories demand a lot from their workers , " wick said . " on this front creating products for companies like c & a or metro has become such an intense global competition that it pushes down social standards constantly .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .

the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures . after the botched attempt to arrest and deport radical muslim imam metin kaplan from germany , the opposition is raising new questions about the compromise reached with chancellor schröder 's government over a much-needed immigration law . edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who was part of the long-running immigration negotiations , has demanded further refinements to the compromise which is designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and work here . kaplan case a " big disgrace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne " referring to german courts ' failure to deport kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has been found guilty of inciting hate in germany and wanted in turkey for high treason , stoiber told bild am sonntag that he would only sign an immigration law " when hate-preachers like kaplan would in future face shorter trials and when such people can be deported . " stoiber criticized the handling of kaplan 's case by german officials as " one of the biggest disgraces for the security authorities in past years . " following kaplan 's sudden disappearance from cologne last week that prompted a europe-wide manhunt and embarrassed german security officials and his subsequent resurfacing , stoiber has demanded clear laws for round-the-clock surveillance of terror suspects to be included in the immigration law . conservatives for preventive detention even angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unhappy with the compromise which has watered down several tough security measures that the conservatives wanted included . in light of kaplan 's case , merkel has renewed calls for preventive detention of up to two years for terror suspects - a clause which was been left out in the proposed immigration law . " the topic has to be discussed with experts and ca n't just be swept under the carpet , " merkel said in a newspaper interview over the weekend . government unbending on compromise the proposed law however will make it easier for germany to deport religious extremists and agitators such as kaplan .
in cases where deportation would result in suspects facing torture or the death penalty in their home country , the suspect can remain in germany under tight restrictions limiting freedom of movement , communication , etc . the lack of the latter has been bedeviling kaplan 's case because there have been fears he could be tortured if he were deported to his native turkey . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has refused to bow in to further security demands by the conservatives and tighten existing measures . " nothing more will be saddled on to the compromise , " interior minister otto schily warned on sunday and said the law would now be formulated according to the compromise reached with the opposition . amnesty slams immigration compromise the compromise however has been strongly criticized by the german chapter of human rights group amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- . ai refugee expert wolfgang grenz told news agency dpa on saturday that the german immigration debate had been too strongly dominated by security concerns .
" that 's no big success when one considers that originally a modern immigration law was planned , " he said . even migration researcher dieter oberndörfer said the immigration compromise was colored by the daily business of politics .
he said he " feared a provincial fear society and a growing narrow-mindedness .

the long-winded case of metin kaplan , the radical muslim cleric , is threatening the recent german immigration compromise .
the conservative opposition has renewed calls that the law include tighter security measures . after the botched attempt to arrest and deport radical muslim imam metin kaplan from germany , the opposition is raising new questions about the compromise reached with chancellor schröder 's government over a much-needed immigration law . edmund stoiber , bavarian premier and head of the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , who was part of the long-running immigration negotiations , has demanded further refinements to the compromise which is designed to make it easier for qualified foreigners to move to germany and work here . kaplan case a " big disgrace " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the self-styled " caliph of cologne " referring to german courts ' failure to deport kaplan -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has been found guilty of inciting hate in germany and wanted in turkey for high treason , stoiber told bild am sonntag that he would only sign an immigration law " when hate-preachers like kaplan would in future face shorter trials and when such people can be deported . " stoiber criticized the handling of kaplan 's case by german officials as " one of the biggest disgraces for the security authorities in past years . " following kaplan 's sudden disappearance from cologne last week that prompted a europe-wide manhunt and embarrassed german security officials and his subsequent resurfacing , stoiber has demanded clear laws for round-the-clock surveillance of terror suspects to be included in the immigration law . conservatives for preventive detention even angela merkel , head of the opposition conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is unhappy with the compromise which has watered down several tough security measures that the conservatives wanted included . in light of kaplan 's case , merkel has renewed calls for preventive detention of up to two years for terror suspects - a clause which was been left out in the proposed immigration law . " the topic has to be discussed with experts and ca n't just be swept under the carpet , " merkel said in a newspaper interview over the weekend . government unbending on compromise the proposed law however will make it easier for germany to deport religious extremists and agitators such as kaplan .
in cases where deportation would result in suspects facing torture or the death penalty in their home country , the suspect can remain in germany under tight restrictions limiting freedom of movement , communication , etc . the lack of the latter has been bedeviling kaplan 's case because there have been fears he could be tortured if he were deported to his native turkey . germany 's ruling coalition of social democrats and greens has refused to bow in to further security demands by the conservatives and tighten existing measures . " nothing more will be saddled on to the compromise , " interior minister otto schily warned on sunday and said the law would now be formulated according to the compromise reached with the opposition . amnesty slams immigration compromise the compromise however has been strongly criticized by the german chapter of human rights group amnesty international -lrb- ai -rrb- . ai refugee expert wolfgang grenz told news agency dpa on saturday that the german immigration debate had been too strongly dominated by security concerns .

german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .
the solar powered ferry can carry up to 50 passengers and 25 bicycles .
and if you look beyond renewable energy sources , we estimate that around 1.3 million people work either directly or indirectly in the environment industry , in services , in environmental control , in waste disposal etc . the european union - including , i might add , its new members - has high environmental standards , and the nice thing is that this has led to new chances on the global market for german businesses in this area . does that mean germany is n't interested in investors who do n't want to bring energy-inefficient businesses here ? no .
i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .
it 's simply untrue that environmentally friendly policies run contrary to business interests . the perfect example is a country like germany , poor in raw materials and with high labour costs because of its standard of living .
when you asked industrialists , they said the same thing about catalytic converters .
when catalytic converters became mandatory , they said it gave them a major push . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : windmills in schleswig-holstein , germany and that 's what we keep finding with enviromental policies .
industry is always hesitant at first , but then they brag about the benefits of enviromental policies . you say eu environmental standards apply to the new eu member states , that will be a long process .
are old eu countries trying to exploit this by reducing standards to the level of the new eu states ? you have to watch the details .
one condition for new states joining the eu is that they adopt all our environmental laws .
that means the standards are already in force .
it would be too expensive to create sewage treatment plants or fit missing filters overnight .
there are transitional deadlines which apply correspondingly to the restrictions on free trade . i 'm sure that the eu expansion will lead to major environmental improvement in both europe and the new member states themselves .
the only exception is that because of the division of labour with the eu market , road traffic may grow faster than levels of economic growth . environment protection is clear to see in germany .
but things have changed in the last 20 years .
protecting the earth 's climate is more complicated .
it costs more and takes longer .
how can you convince people who are more concerned with economic than environmental necessities to take an interest in renewable energy or global warming ? you have to build bridges .
we do have a basic problem with climate change .
you can see it currently in the film " the day after tomorrow . "
the point is to prevent catastrophic climatic change , not to learn from it after the event .
in the film , the u.s. president comes to realize this . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental concerns are important in germany we need to create a win-win situation .
if we better insulate buildings , we all save on our heating bills - people who have built or renovated houses now understand this .
insulation programmes are very popular .
the same principle applies to much of the renewable energy sector . we made less progress when it comes to cars .
we have made success in the past few years in reducing automotive emissions .
in 2003 , the decrease was two-and-a-half percent .
but we still see that when people decide what car to buy next they go with the biggest and heaviest model . that continues to be popular .
in this case , lifestyle triumphs over reason .
there 's a lot of work left to do . the interview was conducted by dagmar engel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany makes eu deadline for co2 plans after chancellor schröder settled a months-long cabinet dispute over greenhouse gas cuts , germany has submitted its plans for reducing carbon dioxide emissions to brussels .

nato is engaged in peacekeeping missions in three of the world 's hotspots : bosnia-herzegovina , kosovo and afghanistan .
each seeks to stabilize and rebuild a region torn apart by war . the north atlantic treaty organization was created in 1949 as a counterweight to soviet forces in central and eastern europe after world war two .
for decades , the western alliance provided an opposing force to the warsaw pact and served as a defense shield against a feared attack directed from moscow .
but after the cold war ended , nato began the process of redefining itself .
in the mid-1990s , after the former yugoslavia exploded in internecine warfare , it took on a role as peacekeeper .
bosnia-herzegovina in 1995 , after much hesitation and difficult negotiations with then-serbian strongman slobodan milosevic , nato entered bosnia-herzegovina with a force of 60,000 soldiers in order to keep the warring parties - serbs , croats and bosnians - apart .
the reputation of the effectiveness of international forces had suffered a powerful blow around the world after u.n. bluehelmets stood by helplessly as thousands of muslim civilians were massacred in srebenica .
still , nato peacekeepers in the time since have managed to bring a degree of peace and stability to the once explosive region .
nine years later , the original force of 60,000 has been reduced to 7,000 .
those soldiers are primarily active in building streets and railroad tracks , clearing mines and gathering illegal weapons left over from the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldier guards entrance to a german peace keepers camp in the bosnian serb village of celebici near foca , some 80 kilometers -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- southeast of sarajevo , in cities and villages in the area , nato-lead international troops have set up liaison offices with local administrations .
the cooperation on the ground functions relatively well , according to nato .
after much discussion , the u.s. has decided to pull its troops out of the bosnia .
the command of the stabilization force there , or sfor , will be handed over at the end of the year to the european union , in close consultation with bosnian officials .
kosovo in neighboring kosovo , nato 's kfor troops have had less success in bringing order and quiet to this serbian province currently under u.n. administration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers of the nato-led kfor peacekeeping force in kosovo guard the unmik united nation mission in kosovo regional headquarters in the southern kosovo town of prizren .
although 17,500 soldiers have been deployed to the region , the difficulty of the mission is illustrated in the fresh violence that broke out in march between the serbian minority and albanian majority .
despite progress in starting to rebuilding the region physically , a political settlement between serbs and albanians still looks far off .
talks about the future status of the province will succeed only after the two groups learn to get along with one another .
kfor is nato 's largest peacekeeping operation and will be commanded until september by holger kammerhoff , a german general .
the berlin government had hoped to be able to slowly reduce the german contingent , now at 3,900 soldiers .
but at present that will not likely happen and the german defense ministry is prepared for a presence there of many more years .
afghanistan the first deployment of nato troops outside europe , as leaders of the 6,500-strong isaf contingent in afghanistan , is proving one of the more dangerous missions .
isaf troops have often been targeted for attack ; this week a norwegian soldier was killed .
with its 2,000 soldiers , germany has the largest contingent in isaf , whose troops are concentrated in the capital kabul .
however , nato is also building regional reconstruction teams , one of which is made up of german soldiers in the northern city kunduz .
another will be set up in feisabad along with dutch soldiers .
two other teams are made up of british and new zealand soldiers and five additional are in the planning stages .
the u.s. has some 10,000 soldiers based in the east and south of the country , separated from isaf troops .
mainly concerned with fighting taliban extremists and terrorists , they operate a total of eight regional reconstruction teams .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german nato-led soldiers in kabul the work of all the teams are important in the preparations for the upcoming elections in afghanistan in september . despite that , nato 's commander-in-chief , u.s. general james jones , is having problems getting needed additional troops for the afghanistan mission .
many of the armies in nato 's 26 member states are still not trained or prepared for foreign deployment , complains lord robertson , the organization 's former secretary general . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato peacekeepers in action in kosovo troops from the k-for peacekeeping force in kosovo engaged with hidden attackers on friday as a series of attacks prompted nato soldiers to use deadly force .

no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .

i think anyone involved in energy-intensive areas who is n't efficient does n't have a chance on the global market .
the high degree of energy efficiency we 've been able to develop in our businesses helps us rather than hurts us in global competition .

german environment minister trittin , who has clashed with industry and unions in the past , argues in an interview with dw-tv that eco- friendly policies do n't necessarily run contrary to business interests . german environment minister jürgen trittin , a member of the green party , the junior partner in the ruling coalition , has increasingly locked horns with industry in recent years . earlier this month , his plans to implement a eu system of " carbon credits " to companies to cut pollution incensed business leaders .
they argued it would put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations . last year , trittin 's controversial law imposing a deposit on one-way bottles and cans used for drinks such as mineral water and beer raised the ire of the beverage industry who complained the scheme was inconvenient for consumers and excessively costly to retailers and bottlers . dw-tv : let 's begin with a cliche .
no one is interested in preventing climate change when money is scarce .
is anyone in the german government interested in environmental protection except you ? jürgen trittin : oh yes .
environmental protection is an industry that 's actually thriving here in germany .
we have created tens of thousands of job in the renewable energy industry over the last few years .
120,000 people are employed there .
for example , in magdeburg , it 's now the largest industrial employer . but industrialists say environmental directives make things more expensive .
can you defend germany as a place to do business when you 're trying to convince an investor ? if you look at the number of unemployed , then of course 120,000 is not very much .
but if you consider that that is more than in the atomic energy industry and the coal industry together , then you can see that it is a large industry . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helio , the first international solar shuttle , in radolfzell at lake constance , germany .

a growing number want products that are n't made in third world sweat shops , thus forcing companies to ensure that 's the case . social campaigns in recent years have ensured that a growing number of german consumers now first reach for the " made in " label before they buy a product or avoid stores tainted by allegations of exploiting cheap labor in the third world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an ethnic hazara girl weaves a carpet in a small workshop on the outskirts of mazar-e-sharif , northern afghanistan .

no one should underestimate the enormity of the task or pretend that we can reduce or remove congestion at a stroke . "

the criticism follows the release of his new show , hell 's kitchen , in which he tries to mould 10 stars into cooks .
fellow chefs said the show did not reflect life in most kitchens and would deter young people from becoming cooks .
david foskett of the london school of tourism , hospitality and leisure , said : " it 's a poor shop window for catering . "
dj tommy vance and athlete dwain chambers left the show after receiving verbal abuse from the explosive chef .
professor foskett said the show left him speechless : " words fail me , it 's so awful .
' not real ' " i was speaking to a number of chefs recently and they are all saying the same - this does n't do the image of the industry any good at all . "
the programme bears as much relation to a real kitchen as wacky races does to formula one " peter harden harden 's uk restaurant guide " i have parents phoning me up saying they wo n't put their son or daughter in the business .
" people are asking , ' is it really like that ? ' and it 's not like that at all . "
chris galvin , head chef of the wolseley in london , agreed : " people being sworn at all day is far from the truth .
" i would love to see people concentrating on the positive aspects of being a chef because you can travel the world , meet people you would n't dream of and have a fantastic time " .
peter harden , editor of harden 's uk restaurant guide , said : " the programme bears as much relation to a real kitchen as wacky races does to formula one .
" it seems all gordon ramsay is dishing out is humiliation of celebrities and confrontation . "
example but a spokeswoman for gordon ramsay said : " you could never compare the celebrities in the show with real chefs and they have never pretended to be that , but it is an example of what it can be like .
" some people are going to love the show and some people are n't .
" there are those in the catering industry who think it 's fantastic . "
hell 's kitchen started on 23 may .
it lasts for two weeks and forces celebrities to cook for diners at a ramsay-run restaurant .
the celebrity chefs are voted for by the public and the least popular will be evicted .
the celebrities taking part include former brookside actress jennifer ellison , gimme gimme gimme actor james dreyfus and coronation street 's amanda barrie .

the hungry bunnies have invaded two roundabouts in the centre of wisbech and are scoffing the town 's floral displays .
now , organisers of the cambridgeshire town 's bloom contest bid fear the rabbits will ruin their efforts .
and residents are even adding to the problem - by encouraging the rabbits with gifts of carrots .
penny stocks , of wisbech in bloom , said : " the rabbits are chomping all the leaves and flowers .
" then people see them , think they have n't got much to eat and throw lettuces and carrots on to the roundabouts , making them look even worse . "
she added : " at first i did say it would be really nice if they were sent off to bury st edmunds , which is our main competitor , but i have had a re-think .
" rabbits are supposed to be lucky and by the time the judges come at the end of july we could have hundreds of rabbits .
" all that luck in their feet could be just what we need . "

the prime minister , tony blair , mp david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

the prime minister , tony blair , mp david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

the prime minister , tony blair , mp david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

the prime minister , tony blair , mp david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

the prime minister , tony blair , mp david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

the prime minister , tony blair , mp david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

the prime minister , tony blair , mp david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

the prime minister , tony blair , mp david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

the prime minister , tony blair , mp david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

david frost : well , as promised , the prime minister is indeed here with us right now - prime minister welcome .
perhaps , we should just start with the news from yesterday of what went on in saudi arabia , linked with al-qaeda by some of the accounts and so on , what , what 's the latest you know about it ?
tony blair : the latest we know is simply that the situation is being resolved but obviously there , there 's been loss of life and it 's yet another reminder of , of the terrorist threat that we face .
david frost : some people , of course , say that iraq did n't lessen terror around the world but encouraged al-qaeda to do more , if anything - provoked it to do more .
what do you say to that ?
tony blair : the most important thing for people to remember is that this terrorism has been going on for several years , even before september 11th .
but then september 11th was a totally unprovoked attack by al-qaeda on the united states of america .
we 've just had a few weeks ago al-qaeda claiming the assassination of the head of the iraqi governing council .
they 're there in iraq now , they 're there in saudi arabia , they 're in european countries , they 're trying to operate here .
this is n't a question of iraq having provoked this , it 's been going on for a long time and it is the real security threat we face and resolving the situation in iraq , getting a stable government , not one run by saddam hussein , is actually part of resolving this battle against terrorism .
david frost : but it has perhaps , in the short term , exacerbated things ?
tony blair : well i think what happens is , when you start to take these people on , whether by disrupting their activities in afghanistan , that used to be used as a base , or by trying to make sure that iraq becomes a stable country and you drive back out the terrorists who are in there at the moment , or indeed in any of our european countries or in saudi arabia as we see , the important thing to remember is september 11th , that was n't begun by america , it was begun by al-qaeda , and actually september 11th itself was the culmination of a whole series of terrorist attacks .
david frost : do we know how many al-qaeda operatives there are in the uk ?
tony blair : no .
we ca n't be sure .
david frost : ca n't be sure .
tony blair : but what we do know is that these people are here , they 're in every single european country - incidentally , whether those countries supported the war in iraq or did n't support the war in iraq - and they pose a threat , a serious threat to us all , and our security services are doing a , a brilliant job of getting on top of it but it 's a constant danger .
david frost : and you 're trying to - according to that two page story in the sunday times today - you 're going to try and woo young muslims , in particular young muslims , but muslims in general , away from al-qaeda and towards us .
tony blair : well i think that there are two things that we need to do .
we need to try and make sure that within our , our own country we 're in proper dialogue with the muslim community .
because the leaders of that community are very responsible people - i met some of them when i was in manchester just the other week .
they 're very responsible people but they 're under enormous pressure from those within their ranks who say , you know , it 's only a very , very small minority , but who push this extremist line .
and that 's one thing we 've got to do to try and counter that .
and the second thing is that we have got to do everything we can to make progress on the israel-palestine issue .
i mean i do n't think there 's anything more important to improving the relations between the arab and muslim world and the west , than that .
david frost : and , and in fact there has n't been much progress in the last year or so , at all .
so that 's a real disappointment .
tony blair : it is .
i mean we 've got a principle now of two states , israel and palestine , and the palestinian state has to be viable , but we have got to make progress on this issue and i do n't think there 's anything more important .
and i think , you know , the , the position that we have on security and terrorism is right - this is the security threat , we have to deal with it - but we will be in a better place to deal with it if we make progress on the middle east .
david frost : let 's come on to iraq just for a few minutes , prime minister .
are we now at the stage where you expected us to be a year ago ?
tony blair : not in security terms .
no .
i think it 's , it 's obvious that you 've got a coming together of former saddam elements , some of these local militias and then outside terrorists - and we have to deal with that .
i mean it , the point about iraq is that there 's a lot of progress that 's been made - i mean i know it does n't hit the news very much , but actually when you go to parts of iraq you can see enormous progress being made .
there is one problem , but it 's a serious problem , and it is security - because these terrorist groups have a very simple strategy , it is literally to kill anybody who tries to make the country better , to assassinate anybody who is connected with the iraqi government and to try and disrupt the un process for a transition to democracy .
so i think we 're at the worst time now , and in the months to come , because around the time of the transition to iraqi sovereignty these people will be attempting to do whatever they can to disrupt that process , and we just have to be ready for that .
david frost : and inevitably mistakes have been made along the way , have n't they ?
i mean mr allawi who - has everybody signed off on him as the new prime minister , by the way ?
the governing council proposed him , maybe surprisingly , but then have we , have you , the americans , un , have they all signed off on him , is he definitely going to be the prime minister ?
tony blair : well it 's not a question of us signing off on him , the important thing is that mr brahimi , who is in charge of the united nations process , that he will nominate the prime minister , president , two vice-presidents , the rest of the government , and it seems that mr allawi 's name is , is there , but that 's really a matter for him .
david frost : yes because mr allawi , when he was here , sitting on the yellow sofa back in december , he put his finger on one thing - he thought that disbanding , in terms of what i mentioned - disbanding the iraqi army , after the coalition victory , was a dreadful mistake , and it created the power vacuum that led to the collapse of security in much of the country .
do you think that was a mistake , disbanding the whole - what was it 400,000 - iraqi army , in retrospect ?
tony blair : i think that there was a - a real difficulty in retrospect , not just about the iraqi army but about the process of what 's called de-ba 'thification , in other words getting rid of the old ba 'th party , which is the party that supported saddam hussein , getting rid of all those elements .
and i think probably in retrospect people think well we needed to do that in a more discriminating way than we did .
the only thing i would say against that , however , is that there was huge pressure from within iraq to make sure that nobody who had any connection with the previous regime was allowed near the new government .
but , you know , that , that 's in retrospect - david frost : it is a classic example of the old phrase " it seemed like a good idea at the time " - now with retrospect it does n't look a good idea but it , you can see how they did it , why they did it - or why we did it - but it 's not a good idea looking back .
tony blair : well i think you , you can see now that it 's important to make sure that we have the iraqi security forces themselves in place , and that 's really what we 're doing .
i mean the strategy that we 've got for iraq now has got two parts to it .
one is a political process , which is going to be led by the united nations , where we have elections in january to a constituent assembly and then full democratic elections at the end of december - which will be a tremendous thing , for iraq , for the middle east , for the world .
the second part is a security plan that involves the progressive , what i call iraqi-isation of the security - in other words , the iraqi army , the iraqi civil defence , the iraqi police start to do the security work .
now at the moment they need our help but we need progressively to get to a situation where they take it over and we withdraw .
david frost : what 's the situation , prime minister , exactly on these 3000 troops that we may or may not be sending ?
the army generals today and the " army blast blair for delaying fresh iraq deployment , " delaying it ' til after the elections and so on and so forth , when are you going to make that decision ?
tony blair : well i do n't know .
probably some time in the next few weeks .
but it 's not being delayed because of the elections at all .
i mean it 's simply , you know , you need to make sure you get this decision right and there are all sorts of different options that are under consideration .
the important thing is , we 've got to remain there until the job is done - although i hope and anticipate that in a year 's time there will be a very substantial reduction in troops from where we are now .
but it all depends on getting the iraqi security forces themselves with the capability to do the work .
i mean there will be a complete transfer of sovereignty after the 30th of june - i mean there 's no doubt about that .
from then on the british forces , the american forces , all the forces from the different 30 countries that are there in iraq , remain then with the consent of the new iraqi government .
and we remain simply to allow and enable the new iraqi government to build up those iraqi forces themselves .
now that 's happening , but it needs to happen quicker and better .
they need to be properly trained and equipped and led and that 's what we 're working on now .
so i think you see those two parts of the process , the political process for the un , and the security process in which we will help .
david frost : is there , though , in terms of after june the 30th , is there a slight difference , a difference of emphasis between you and colin powell over the rules of engagement , as it were ?
that you 've made it very , very clear that any politically sensitive military manoeuvre will be subject to the approval of the new government .
does he go along with that ?
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean the difference - david frost : he does ?
tony blair : he does , absolutely .
the difference is , is very simple .
obviously american or british troops have got to be able to protect themselves and take whatever measures are necessary to protect themselves and once you have taken the political decision to go down a particular direction or mount a particular operation , then obviously the conduct of that operation has got to remain with the generals and the troops on the ground .
but the point is that the political decision making switches after the 30th of june , from mr bremmer to the new iraqi prime minister and government .
david frost : and how much damage have we sustained , and how lasting damage , from all the troubled stories of what 's been going on in the prisons in iraq ?
i mean obviously we 're losing the battle on the streets , arab streets now , but how much damage have we sustained ?
tony blair : well it 's been damaging .
because they were absolutely ghastly and unacceptable and they revolted any normal and decent human being .
what the lasting damage is , i think will depend on the state of iraq .
and that 's why i say if iraq , as i believe , can get through to next january , have elections and then get through to proper democratic elections , that is a , that is the biggest defeat of this anti-western and extremist propaganda that we could possibly imagine .
that is why iraq is so important .
and sometimes , you know , it gets very frustrating when people talk about iraq today as if prior to the invasion of iraq it was somehow a benign place .
i mean iraq had started two wars in that region , costing hundreds of thousands of lives , hundreds of thousands of their own citizens had been killed and murdered , some in respect of whom chemical weapons had been used , and that whole country was degraded to the point where 60 per cent of the population was dependent on food aid administered through vouchers given out by saddam hussein and his government .
and so , you know , the idea that what we had prior to the invasion of iraq was somehow , you know , a settled situation - we did n't .
there were thousands of british troops involved in policing iraq before we ever began the conflict .
now , as for whatever damage the pictures have done , the question will be , in the end for iraqis , and i think for the region , have we in fact made the country better .
do we leave iraq with the country better , with the oil the property of the iraqis , with the wealth of iraq , the iraqis ' wealth , and with the government in the hands of iraqis .
david frost : but when - when would you project that security would be such that you would say it was satisfactory ?
is that years away ?
tony blair : no .
i mean - david frost : no ?
tony blair : no , most definitely not .
i mean i hope very much within , in the coming months we will see an improvement in security as the iraqis build up their own capability .
and i hope very much in a year from now i would want , certainly by the end of next year , to have a substantial reduction in the british troop commitment .
david frost : by the end of next year .
tony blair : yes , i would certainly hope so .
now , as i say , it depends on the capability of the iraqis , but when i spoke to the iraqi defence minister , just the other day , he was pretty upbeat about it .
i mean the , the problem is not - as i say - complicated .
it is groups of terrorists and former regime elements doing everything they can to sabotage progress .
david frost : and in terms of opinion polls and so on , the , your average satisfaction rating , as i 'm sure you know , in the first year was 66 per cent , and last year it was below 33 per cent - on average , both on average - do you put all that down to iraq ?
tony blair : it 's difficult to judge but obviously it gets more difficult as you , as you go on as prime minister , that 's for sure , but also iraq has been a very divisive issue .
david frost : so that has been the major factor , you would say - tony blair : well i mean the thing is - david frost : - in this decline of satisfaction or trust .
tony blair : yeah .
i mean i 've just been out for two days in the country round the north west and yorkshire and what is interesting to me is that , yes iraq is the shadow over our support - there 's no doubt about that , there 's no point in disputing that - but actually people do increasingly recognise the economy 's stronger , there are more jobs , unemployment 's down , the national health service is getting better , there 's investment in our schools , there 's extra numbers of police on the street .
so , you know , i think underneath whatever is the worry about iraq , because i think people ask well do they have a plan to get through iraq , i mean i think that 's the thing that concerns people - and actually we do - i think that underneath that - david frost : what - what really concerned people was saying - did they have a plan at the end of the war , that it seemed to be cobbled together afterwards - i think that was the thing .
not that you , you have a plan now , doubtless , but that the allies in general appeared not to have a plan immediately after the war .
tony blair : yeah , but i would strongly dispute that .
i mean - david frost : you would .
tony blair : yes , because the key issue for people , at the end of the war , was would we face a humanitarian disaster in iraq .
i mean if you remember at the time , the planning was all to deal with that - well we had n't .
what we , i 've had - david frost : ... oil wells burnt and things like that .
tony blair : exactly .
now that 's not what 's happening .
in fact if it were n't for the sabotage iraqi oil production would be up beyond what it was , you know , before saddam was , was removed from power .
so , you know , when people say you did n't have a plan for iraq , we actually had a plan for iraq , we 're carrying it through , however , the terrorism issue is very , very serious .
i mean there 's no doubt that these groups of people , because of the very simple strategy they have , can do a lot of damage .
they can blow up a pipeline , you know , there 's thousands of kilometres of pipeline , they can blow it up .
they can kill people who are involved in trying to rebuild power stations .
they can assassinate people who are engaged in the political process .
but my response to that is that we should n't then lose heart or fade away in those circumstances , we should stand up to them and help the iraqis go towards the democracy they all want to see .
david frost : in the daily mirror yesterday , prime minister , just to get this once and for all clear , you , you vowed to lead the labour party into the next election and you said " i am up for it , no shortage of desire , because i believe in what i 'm doing .
i do this job because i believe in what i am doing . "
just quickly to just clarify some of that in my own head .
you said you 're - tony blair : congratulations in taking 15 minutes to get round to this , anyway .
david frost : yes , yes .
looking at the clock .
but the , just , just quickly through this , you 've said you will stand at the next election , and if you win the next election , you 've said you 'll serve a full term .
is that right ?
tony blair : it 's exactly as i said to you last september .
david frost : right , exactly the same .
tony blair : it is exactly the same .
it always has been .
yes , i 'm absolutely up for it , in the end the british people are the boss , they 're the people that make the decision , and the reason i 'm up for it is there 's a lot more still to do .
david frost : one quote that is new since last september was you said , apparently to various friends and so on , that if you thought you were an electoral liability you would go .
tony blair : well you 've always got to have the support of your party but i believe i have that support .
you 've got to have the support of the people , and that 's decided in an election .
but , you know , david frost : but how would you - how would you , take , here 's an example .
yesterday 's telegraph said " voters prefer brown to blair " .
now that theoretically suggests he 'll see he 's a liability and he 'll go .
but then you look closer at the figures and you see that in fact 80 per cent of labour voters want you to stay for a few years or many years - so that was n't the reason .
but how would you ever found out that you needed to go ?
tony blair : yeah , well that 's a very good point , so let 's just - we 'll just carry on then .
david frost : -lsb- laughs -rsb- but you do n't rule out a fourth term ?
tony blair : look , let 's make sure that the british people endorse us next time round .
i mean , you know , if - the , the - the reason why i , sometimes people think i 'm a bit unnaturally coy about this , is that what i ca n't stand , you know , if you , if you go down one path you get he 's about to quit and if you go down the other path you get the headline i 'm going on and on and on , which sounds - david frost : like mrs t. but it goes without saying that whenever you do decide to go that you will endorse gordon as your successor .
tony blair : well , i mean again , these are decisions for the future but i 've always made it clear the high regard i have for him .
i mean it 's been a great partnership , he 's been a brilliant chancellor , he 's delivered huge economic strength for this country and , you know , he 's , he 's a tremendous asset to the party - and to the country .
david frost : in that case you should , you should endorse him right now .
tony blair : yeah , but let 's just - i 've given you enough headlines for one day , so let 's get on - get on with the next bit .
david frost : all right , coming on to europe .
when do you think there will be a settlement that can be signed off in dublin next month or so - do you think that that deal can be done between the countries by , by the time of the meeting of the heads of state and so on in dublin ?
tony blair : well either by the time or at the time .
david frost : or at the time .
tony blair : yeah .
yes i do , yes .
david frost : yeah , but one way or another .
tony blair : i mean we 've got to make sure that we get our - david frost : red lines .
tony blair : - yeah , then - it 's really - it 's a question of making sure that it is very clear that the settlement on the european constitutional treaty is one that protects absolutely our right to set our own tax rates , to conduct our foreign policy , our defence , our social security system and so on .
and we need this treaty in order to make europe work more effectively now it 's 25 not 15 members , but we should make sure that it is genuinely cooperation between nations not some federal super state and we should make sure also that having concluded this treaty that 's the last word for the foreseeable future .
david frost : and when would you foresee being able to hold the referendum ?
tony blair : i do n't - we just ca n't tell at the moment .
we said that we should have parliamentary process , you know , as , as , when that comes , that will come before we have a referendum so obviously it depends , to an extent , how long that takes .
i mean i just ca n't tell at the moment .
david frost : but it looks as though in a third term , if re-elected , if you get through the constitution vote , you somehow win that one , there wo n't be time for , for the single currency for , for a while after that .
tony blair : well the single currency just depends on the economic conditions being right .
you know , at the moment our economy has probably been the strongest of any of the major countries in the world in the last few years - so it 's quite difficult to say to people it 's , there is a compelling economic case to go into the euro now .
on the other hand i think that long term it is in britain 's interest to be part of the single currency but that 's got to be determined according to the economic tests that we 've set out .
i think the main thing , frankly , short term , is to make the case for britain being a leading player in europe .
i mean one thing that is very clear to me in these european elections is that the , you know , absolutely deep-dyed euro sceptic case , ie : get britain out of europe , has gained some ground and it 's very important that responsible politicians counter that .
so the idea that we should divorce ourselves from the main political union in the world today , with whom we do 60 per cent of our economic trade , is absurd .
and yet i think it 's important we are out there countering that .
and i , one of the reasons why i changed my mind on the referendum and in the end said look if we 've got , we 're going to have this treaty , you know , we 've got to give the people the final say , is that we 've just got to make that case .
there 's got to be , i think , a real sense at some point of this country coming to a decision and saying yes we want to be part of europe .
david frost : yes but people say remember , i remember a few months ago you and gordon were going to go out on a big crusade for europe and so on , but you never really did that .
tony blair : no , but that was around the euro , and what we said is look if we 're going to go into the single currency , we 're going to have to go out and fight the case .
now the truth is the reason why , as i was saying earlier , it 's been difficult to make the case for immediate entry to the euro , is i do n't actually know many people even in business who are pro euro who are saying that now .
we should keep the option open , we 'd be very foolish to rule it out - david frost : right .
tony blair : - but i mean that 's the reason why that campaign did n't take place .
david frost : and - but it 's obviously got to take place before the constitution .
tony blair : absolutely .
i mean there 's no ducking that because that 's going to be there - there will be a constitution - if we get the agreement there 'll be a constitution , there 'll be a referendum , and this will be the moment at which i hope that all sensible , serious people who believe this country 's future lies as part of the european union come together and make the case properly .
david frost : robin cook said here - you remember him , right ?
he said " britain 's share of foreign investment has collapsed .
it 's barely a quarter of what it was before the euro . "
is that true ?
tony blair : i do n't think so .
david frost : it was news to me too but - tony blair : yeah , but i mean - no .
david frost : you do n't think - you think he 's slipped up there ?
tony blair : well i do n't - i mean i 'd have to see the full context of what he says but i do n't think that 's true .
i mean we 're still basically the number one destination for foreign inward investment .
although it is true , obviously , you know , that there is a risk long term of us losing direct investment , particularly if the eurozone were to pick up , if their economies were to start to reform , if they were to become a more dynamic economic zone , then , then , i think long term that there could be risks to our inward investment but for the moment i think our position 's reasonably secure .
david frost : what about this situation with the postal vote and so on .
i mean can you , do you think , guarantee that this printing problem - what is it seven million envelopes are behind , or whatever - will be sorted out so that everyone gets a chance to vote and every vote gets counted .
can you guarantee that today , or not yet ?
tony blair : well i 'm assured that this is the case , so it , it better be .
and i think , to be fair , i mean i think 75 per cent of the ballot papers are now out .
now it 's the next few days we 've got to get the rest of it done and there 's been some printing problems but people are working round the clock to make sure that that happens .
david frost : and we have big headlines again today that you 're really going to take action on obesity .
what can you do about it ?
not personally , because you 're slim and - tony blair : i - i mean - being prime minister i should keep within the bounds of government policy but i just want to say one thing at the beginning , i do think we can get this issue in the wrong place .
i mean the primary responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
i mean i , i ca n't , you know i 'm responsible for many things but i ca n't make people slimmer .
what i can do is encourage , for example , sport in schools , which we 're expanding .
we can give information to people , we can try and get the food industry and others to behave responsibly but ultimately i think it 's quite important we do n't end up thinking that the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small .
david frost : exactly .
we 'll just leap in there to get gillian 's headlines .
-lsb- news -rsb- david frost : well we 're almost at the end of our time but people all said when you came to power that you wanted first of all to show that labour could be a stable economic force and so on as manager , and you 've done that , and we 've talked earlier on about how elusive the eu is proving in terms of the single currency , you also wanted to reform public services - how much of that , people would say the jury is out , i suppose on that - how , how far do you think you 've got on that ?
tony blair : i think we 've , we 've got a considerable way but there 's a long way still to go .
but i do n't think there 's any doubt at all that the national health service is getting better .
i think that you can see the investment in our schools but we 've still got a lot to do on the vocational side .
there are record numbers of police , you know the criminal justice system is being reformed but there 's still an enormous amount to do , there 's no doubt about that .

speaking at his enthronement on saturday , bishop michael perham said his theme would be " repair my church " he said he would work with the people of many faiths and traditions - but warned that repair could mean change .
bishop michael became the 40th bishop of gloucester in a ceremony at the cathedral on saturday .
the day started with a simple service at st mary 's church in deerhurst , led by the bishop of tewkesbury .
after that was a move to st james in tredworth , from where bishop michael began the journey on foot to the cathedral .
the 56-year-old bishop stopped on the way to meet leaders of other faith community groups in the city .
the diocese of gloucester encompasses most of gloucestershire , as well as parts of neighbouring counties .

the businessman who owns bhs and arcadia is said to be prepared to invest up to £ 1bn of his personal fortune in the venture .
but the financial services authority has said it is to investigate a surge in m & s shares ahead of mr green 's bid last thursday .
the body was contacted when m & s shares traded reached abnormally high levels .
m & s probe " the fsa has noted the price movement prior to the announcement and in line with our policy of reviewing all suspicious price movements is reviewing trading in marks & spencer shares and related derivatives , " the fsa said .
m & s is to launch its own inquiry into who the owners of its stock will eventually be , the mail on sunday and the sunday times report .
it 's a great british institution , what we 're interested in doing is to help rebuild it philip green , retailer profile : philip green is marks & spencer 's decline terminal ?
the company has sent about 20 " 212 notices " to shareholders demanding to know the origin of their owners .
meanwhile , shareholders are calling for luc vandevelde , the part-time chairman who has hinted he is ready to go , to quit immediately , the independent on sunday reports .
they want a top retailer brought in , with former arcadia boss stuart ross a favourite , the newspaper says .
' 400p a share ' m & s saw sales slide this year , provoking concern the company 's recovery from the late 1990s sales slump had stalled .
mr green 's bid is now expected to include a cash and shares offer of around 400 pence a share , according to the observer newspaper .
m & s has seen sales slide this year it is understood that he has secured finance from hbos , royal bank of scotland and barclays capital , while goldman sachs and merrill lynch are willing to underwrite part of the deal .
the tycoon is also expected to revive the st michael brand , shed by the current m & s management .
this is not the first time mr green has made a play for m & s. he made an offer for the company in 1999 which was later withdrawn .
this time round , mr green could face competition from a counter bid from venture capitalists led by kkr , carlysle group , permira and cvc , the observer says .

he denied any wrongdoing , saying he had resigned in order to safeguard the reputation of aer lingus .
he said he was " tax compliant " and knew nothing about a british virgin island company , faldor , which is the focus of the aib scandal .
" i am of the view that this whole issue draws adverse publicity on aer lingus as a state company by association , " he said .
the case follows hard on the heels of aib 's admission earlier this month that it had mistakenly overcharged customers for foreign exchange transactions .

instead mr blair spelled out his own determination to lead the country into the next general election .
speaking to bbc 's breakfast with frost , the prime minister dismissed talk of his stepping aside in favour of mr brown as " decisions for the future " .
but he conceded : " in the end , the british people are the boss - they 're the people who make the decision . "
i have always made it clear the high regard i have had for him " tony blair on gordon brown " the reason that i 'm up for it -lsb- leading labour into the next election -rsb- is there 's a lot more still to do . "
last week deputy prime minister john prescott suggested mr blair could " follow the example of harold wilson " , who stood down mid-term .
he said mr blair would have labour 's full support if he led the party into the next general election , but hinted that the prime minister could be derailed by " events " .
the remark followed his earlier comments , which had suggested cabinet ministers were jockeying for position in case mr blair stood down .
' unnaturally coy ' but the prime minister made it clear on sunday that he intended to fight the next election as labour leader .
" i am absolutely up for it ...
you have always got to have the support of your party , but i believe i have that support .
you have got to have the support of the people and that 's decided in an election . "
mr blair said the reason he seemed " unnaturally coy " about his future intentions was that whatever he said , it would either be construed that he was quitting or he was going to go " on and on and on " .
asked by sir david frost if he would endorse gordon brown as his successor , mr blair said : " these are decisions for the future , but i have always made it clear the high regard i have had for him .
" it 's been a great partnership - he 's a brilliant chancellor .
he 's delivered huge economic strengths to this country .
" he 's a tremendous asset to the party and the country . "
' shadow of iraq ' mr blair 's comments came after a yougov poll of 2,131 people published by the daily telegraph on saturday suggested more voters believed that gordon brown would make a better prime minister .
a total of 29 % plumped for the chancellor as the ideal candidate , while 25 % opted for mr blair .
the poll also said 59 % believed that mr blair should resign immediately or before the next general election - with 41 % wanting him to step down immediately and 18 % preferring him to leave sometime ahead of the election .
only 18 % wanted him to stay for many more years .
mr blair said winning round public opinion did " get more difficult as you go on as prime minister " and conceded that iraq was a divisive issue and a " shadow over our support " .
obesity but he insisted that people also recognised the government 's other achievements in the economy , jobs , schools , the health service and policing .
mr blair defended his government 's role in tackling obesity , following a report by the commons heath committee that criticised ministers , the nhs , food manufacturers and advertisers for not doing enough to address the problem .
the prime minister said that while the government could encourage sport in school and food manufacturers to behave responsibly , individuals also had to play their part .
" i am responsible for many things , but i ca n't make people slimmer , " he said .
" the prime responsibility for people looking after themselves is with people .
" but ultimately i think it is quite important we do n't end up thinking the government can somehow determine whether people are large or small . "
