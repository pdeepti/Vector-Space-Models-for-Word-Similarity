want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?
a new web site called litrix.de can help . litrix editor heike friesel knows that there are other resources on the internet to help fans of german literature abroad choose what new books to read . but litrix , she says , is different . " the big advantage that we offer is that we put comprehensive trial reads of translations online , " friesel said . about 20 pages of each recommended title are translated , " so that interested people in other countries can really get a sense of the text . " regional focus a jury of literary critics is charged with the task of choosing the passages to be presented in german and english , as well as a third language which changes each year to target a different linguistic region . this year , arabic is the language of choice . an east asian language is expected to follow in 2005 . friesel says litrix is aimed primarily at people working in the publishing industry .
" we appeal to publishers , academics , translators , and literary scouts , " she said , " but also germanists , students , and anyone abroad who has to do with german literature . " the litrix web site was established by germany 's federal cultural foundation with the aim of promoting an appreciation of contemporary german literature abroad . visitors to the site find recommended books of the month in three categories : fiction , non-fiction , and children 's books . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot von litrix , german literatur online a click on one of the choices leads to a lengthy book description , as well as a download of the sample passage . should you get hooked and want to read on , the publisher 's details along with an e-mail contact form are available . more than the classics germany is still mainly an importer when it comes to literature .
twice as many books are translated into german than from german into other languages , and one in seven books on the german market is by a foreign author .
while classics from writers such as goethe and kant may be known around the world , access to contemporary german writing is a rarity , something litrix hopes to change . " part of our concept is that we only deal with new publications , " friesel explained .
" so even though there might be an excellent book from three years ago , for us it 's totally irrelevant . instead , we 're working to give foreign publishers access to new german books as soon as possible after they come out on the german market .

berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !

on the spur of the moment i went to the last screening of the festival and met friends in an a-list spot in the ticket line .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.02.2004 salvage team prepares to raise wwii ship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the graf spee claimed many " kills " before being crippled by allied ships and sunk by its own captain .
a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?
a new web site called litrix.de can help . litrix editor heike friesel knows that there are other resources on the internet to help fans of german literature abroad choose what new books to read . but litrix , she says , is different . " the big advantage that we offer is that we put comprehensive trial reads of translations online , " friesel said . about 20 pages of each recommended title are translated , " so that interested people in other countries can really get a sense of the text . " regional focus a jury of literary critics is charged with the task of choosing the passages to be presented in german and english , as well as a third language which changes each year to target a different linguistic region . this year , arabic is the language of choice . an east asian language is expected to follow in 2005 . friesel says litrix is aimed primarily at people working in the publishing industry .
" we appeal to publishers , academics , translators , and literary scouts , " she said , " but also germanists , students , and anyone abroad who has to do with german literature . " the litrix web site was established by germany 's federal cultural foundation with the aim of promoting an appreciation of contemporary german literature abroad . visitors to the site find recommended books of the month in three categories : fiction , non-fiction , and children 's books . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot von litrix , german literatur online a click on one of the choices leads to a lengthy book description , as well as a download of the sample passage . should you get hooked and want to read on , the publisher 's details along with an e-mail contact form are available . more than the classics germany is still mainly an importer when it comes to literature .
twice as many books are translated into german than from german into other languages , and one in seven books on the german market is by a foreign author .
while classics from writers such as goethe and kant may be known around the world , access to contemporary german writing is a rarity , something litrix hopes to change . " part of our concept is that we only deal with new publications , " friesel explained .
" so even though there might be an excellent book from three years ago , for us it 's totally irrelevant . instead , we 're working to give foreign publishers access to new german books as soon as possible after they come out on the german market .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .

trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .

a new web site called litrix.de can help . litrix editor heike friesel knows that there are other resources on the internet to help fans of german literature abroad choose what new books to read . but litrix , she says , is different .

" regional focus a jury of literary critics is charged with the task of choosing the passages to be presented in german and english , as well as a third language which changes each year to target a different linguistic region . this year , arabic is the language of choice . an east asian language is expected to follow in 2005 . friesel says litrix is aimed primarily at people working in the publishing industry .
" we appeal to publishers , academics , translators , and literary scouts , " she said , " but also germanists , students , and anyone abroad who has to do with german literature . " the litrix web site was established by germany 's federal cultural foundation with the aim of promoting an appreciation of contemporary german literature abroad . visitors to the site find recommended books of the month in three categories : fiction , non-fiction , and children 's books . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot von litrix , german literatur online a click on one of the choices leads to a lengthy book description , as well as a download of the sample passage . should you get hooked and want to read on , the publisher 's details along with an e-mail contact form are available . more than the classics germany is still mainly an importer when it comes to literature .
twice as many books are translated into german than from german into other languages , and one in seven books on the german market is by a foreign author .
while classics from writers such as goethe and kant may be known around the world , access to contemporary german writing is a rarity , something litrix hopes to change . " part of our concept is that we only deal with new publications , " friesel explained .
" so even though there might be an excellent book from three years ago , for us it 's totally irrelevant . instead , we 're working to give foreign publishers access to new german books as soon as possible after they come out on the german market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.02.2004 salvage team prepares to raise wwii ship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the graf spee claimed many " kills " before being crippled by allied ships and sunk by its own captain .
a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2004 emissions trading plan riles industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under a new german plan , there could be fewer smokestack emissions in the future .
as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2004 emissions trading plan riles industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under a new german plan , there could be fewer smokestack emissions in the future .
as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.02.2004 column : cuddling at the berlinale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to warm up , movie theaters are the place to go .
berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !
my own favorite berlinale moment ?
happened three years ago .
on the spur of the moment i went to the last screening of the festival and met friends in an a-list spot in the ticket line .
i got in and watched “ 2001 : a space odyssey . ”
afterwards , they handed out the berlinale awards in front of the screen where kubrick ’ s masterpiece had just been shown .
a rare rush of happiness . kay-alexander scholz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale 2004 read dw-world 's complete coverage of the 2004 berlinale .

berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !

berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !
my own favorite berlinale moment ?
happened three years ago .
on the spur of the moment i went to the last screening of the festival and met friends in an a-list spot in the ticket line .
i got in and watched “ 2001 : a space odyssey . ”
afterwards , they handed out the berlinale awards in front of the screen where kubrick ’ s masterpiece had just been shown .

a new web site called litrix.de can help . litrix editor heike friesel knows that there are other resources on the internet to help fans of german literature abroad choose what new books to read . but litrix , she says , is different . " the big advantage that we offer is that we put comprehensive trial reads of translations online , " friesel said . about 20 pages of each recommended title are translated , " so that interested people in other countries can really get a sense of the text . " regional focus a jury of literary critics is charged with the task of choosing the passages to be presented in german and english , as well as a third language which changes each year to target a different linguistic region . this year , arabic is the language of choice . an east asian language is expected to follow in 2005 . friesel says litrix is aimed primarily at people working in the publishing industry .
" we appeal to publishers , academics , translators , and literary scouts , " she said , " but also germanists , students , and anyone abroad who has to do with german literature . " the litrix web site was established by germany 's federal cultural foundation with the aim of promoting an appreciation of contemporary german literature abroad . visitors to the site find recommended books of the month in three categories : fiction , non-fiction , and children 's books . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot von litrix , german literatur online a click on one of the choices leads to a lengthy book description , as well as a download of the sample passage . should you get hooked and want to read on , the publisher 's details along with an e-mail contact form are available . more than the classics germany is still mainly an importer when it comes to literature .
twice as many books are translated into german than from german into other languages , and one in seven books on the german market is by a foreign author .
while classics from writers such as goethe and kant may be known around the world , access to contemporary german writing is a rarity , something litrix hopes to change . " part of our concept is that we only deal with new publications , " friesel explained .
" so even though there might be an excellent book from three years ago , for us it 's totally irrelevant . instead , we 're working to give foreign publishers access to new german books as soon as possible after they come out on the german market .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.02.2004 emissions trading plan riles industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under a new german plan , there could be fewer smokestack emissions in the future .
as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

want to delve into some good contemporary german literature , but do n't know where to start ?
a new web site called litrix.de can help . litrix editor heike friesel knows that there are other resources on the internet to help fans of german literature abroad choose what new books to read . but litrix , she says , is different . " the big advantage that we offer is that we put comprehensive trial reads of translations online , " friesel said . about 20 pages of each recommended title are translated , " so that interested people in other countries can really get a sense of the text . " regional focus a jury of literary critics is charged with the task of choosing the passages to be presented in german and english , as well as a third language which changes each year to target a different linguistic region . this year , arabic is the language of choice . an east asian language is expected to follow in 2005 . friesel says litrix is aimed primarily at people working in the publishing industry .
" we appeal to publishers , academics , translators , and literary scouts , " she said , " but also germanists , students , and anyone abroad who has to do with german literature . " the litrix web site was established by germany 's federal cultural foundation with the aim of promoting an appreciation of contemporary german literature abroad . visitors to the site find recommended books of the month in three categories : fiction , non-fiction , and children 's books . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot von litrix , german literatur online a click on one of the choices leads to a lengthy book description , as well as a download of the sample passage . should you get hooked and want to read on , the publisher 's details along with an e-mail contact form are available . more than the classics germany is still mainly an importer when it comes to literature .
twice as many books are translated into german than from german into other languages , and one in seven books on the german market is by a foreign author .
while classics from writers such as goethe and kant may be known around the world , access to contemporary german writing is a rarity , something litrix hopes to change . " part of our concept is that we only deal with new publications , " friesel explained .
" so even though there might be an excellent book from three years ago , for us it 's totally irrelevant . instead , we 're working to give foreign publishers access to new german books as soon as possible after they come out on the german market .

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .

for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .

trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.02.2004 salvage team prepares to raise wwii ship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the graf spee claimed many " kills " before being crippled by allied ships and sunk by its own captain .
a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.02.2004 column : cuddling at the berlinale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to warm up , movie theaters are the place to go .
berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !
my own favorite berlinale moment ?
happened three years ago .
on the spur of the moment i went to the last screening of the festival and met friends in an a-list spot in the ticket line .
i got in and watched “ 2001 : a space odyssey . ”
afterwards , they handed out the berlinale awards in front of the screen where kubrick ’ s masterpiece had just been shown .

berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

a new web site called litrix.de can help . litrix editor heike friesel knows that there are other resources on the internet to help fans of german literature abroad choose what new books to read . but litrix , she says , is different . " the big advantage that we offer is that we put comprehensive trial reads of translations online , " friesel said . about 20 pages of each recommended title are translated , " so that interested people in other countries can really get a sense of the text . " regional focus a jury of literary critics is charged with the task of choosing the passages to be presented in german and english , as well as a third language which changes each year to target a different linguistic region . this year , arabic is the language of choice . an east asian language is expected to follow in 2005 . friesel says litrix is aimed primarily at people working in the publishing industry .
" we appeal to publishers , academics , translators , and literary scouts , " she said , " but also germanists , students , and anyone abroad who has to do with german literature . " the litrix web site was established by germany 's federal cultural foundation with the aim of promoting an appreciation of contemporary german literature abroad . visitors to the site find recommended books of the month in three categories : fiction , non-fiction , and children 's books . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : screenshot von litrix , german literatur online a click on one of the choices leads to a lengthy book description , as well as a download of the sample passage . should you get hooked and want to read on , the publisher 's details along with an e-mail contact form are available . more than the classics germany is still mainly an importer when it comes to literature .
twice as many books are translated into german than from german into other languages , and one in seven books on the german market is by a foreign author .
while classics from writers such as goethe and kant may be known around the world , access to contemporary german writing is a rarity , something litrix hopes to change . " part of our concept is that we only deal with new publications , " friesel explained .
" so even though there might be an excellent book from three years ago , for us it 's totally irrelevant . instead , we 're working to give foreign publishers access to new german books as soon as possible after they come out on the german market .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.02.2004 column : cuddling at the berlinale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to warm up , movie theaters are the place to go .
berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !
my own favorite berlinale moment ?
happened three years ago .
on the spur of the moment i went to the last screening of the festival and met friends in an a-list spot in the ticket line .
i got in and watched “ 2001 : a space odyssey . ”
afterwards , they handed out the berlinale awards in front of the screen where kubrick ’ s masterpiece had just been shown .

berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !

berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !
my own favorite berlinale moment ?
happened three years ago .
on the spur of the moment i went to the last screening of the festival and met friends in an a-list spot in the ticket line .
i got in and watched “ 2001 : a space odyssey . ”
afterwards , they handed out the berlinale awards in front of the screen where kubrick ’ s masterpiece had just been shown .

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .
" this is the last salvageable german battleship .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

the film is one of 23 productions competing for the festival ’ s top honor , the golden bear , which is awarded by an international jury under the presidency of oscar-winning actress frances mcdormand this year . the berlinale ’ s special focus this year is on south africa as the country celebrates the tenth anniversary of the end of apartheid .
latin america will also receive extra attention : argentine director fernando solanas will receive an honorary golden bear for life-time achievement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " maria , llena eres de gracia " in the competition , his countryman daniel burman ’ s “ el abrazo partido ” -lrb- lost embrace -rrb- focuses on a life in a seedy buenos aires shopping center .

the traditional children ’ s film festival has been expanded to include movies for those 14 and older . this year ’ s retrospective is called “ new hollywood 1967 – 1976 : trouble in wonderland ” and includes classics such as martin scorcese ’ s “ taxi driver , ” francis ford coppola ’ s “ the godfather i / ii ” and dennis hopper ’ s “ easy rider . ”
another retrospective entitled “ selling democracy – welcome mr. marshall ” shows post-world war ii productions aimed at creating support for u.s. reconstruction efforts . berlinale organizers have also invited 520 film makers from 84 countries to attend the so-called talent campus , where they will work with accomplished colleagues such as “ cold mountain ” director anthony minghella , cinematographer michael ballhaus -lrb- “ gangs of new york ” -rrb- and composer zbigniew preisner -lrb- “ blue , ” “ white , ” “ red , ” -rrb- among others .

another event is called “ hollywood in nigeria ” : it looks at the west african country ’ s booming movie industry , where about 1,200 films are produced each year .
“ we thought that africa ’ s been a little underexposed , ” festival director dieter kosslick said , adding that nigerian movie makers had offered to produce films specifically for each of the festival ’ s categories . three go to cannes unlike their nigerian colleagues , three other film makers and production companies decided to pull out their movies from the festival and sent them to cannes later in the spring even as berlinale programs were already getting printed . kosslick admitted to losing some sleep over the loss of walter salles ’ “ the motorcycle diaries , ” based on the journal of revolutionary che guevara .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 04.02.2004 salvage team prepares to raise wwii ship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the graf spee claimed many " kills " before being crippled by allied ships and sunk by its own captain .
a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .

langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .

after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .

salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .

it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .

for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environment minister jurgen trittin .
trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- has prepared his plan in compliance with a directive from the european commission requiring that all member states , including germany , compile and submit to brussels a list of 2,600 companies and their proposed emissions credit allocations by march .
disagreement in berlin the plan has run up against criticism not only from industry , but also from germany ’ s economics ministry , which is afraid the allocations could harm the country 's coal industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economics minister wolfgang clement .
a spokesman for economics minister wolfgang clement -lrb- photo -rrb- told the news agency dpa that the ministry had not signed off on the proposal , but would seek to come to an agreement with the environmental ministry .
so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .
" the chancellor does not intend to intervene , " said government spokesman hans langguth .
" but i can yet again underscore the fact that the so-called national allocations plan will be in place by march 31 no matter what . "
industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .
nothing more was demanded of them than what they already voluntarily agreed to do on their own .
she said industry now wants to increase their emissions and are asking for a so-called needs-oriented program , which would allow them as many credits as they asked for .
“ if everyone gets what they want , the price of these certificates will be zero , and then there wo n't be any market for them , " she said .
disparate demands the dispute has several different sides , numerous groups and an often conflicting array of interests .
the coal industry , for example , wants any incentives for shifting from coal to natural gas to be removed from trittin 's plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preussen-elektra coal fired power plant , grosskrotzenburg-hessen , germany other companies , like e.on and ruhrgas , want additional pollution rights as compensation for the planned phasing out of nuclear energy .
for their part , the electricity-intensive cement , chemical and steel industries fear the government will reach a deal with utility companies at their expense .
the only shared opinion among business representatives seems to be that trittin 's allocations plan should be rejected .
on monday , the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- said if the government fails to find a consensus on the greenhouse gas credits , it must delay submitting its plan to brussels until a deal can be reached .
however , a bdi spokesman said the organization would continue to work with the government to find a workable deal and denied a weekend report in the newsweekly der spiegel that german industry was planning to abandon negotiations with the government .
tritten has rejected the criticism and has vowed to push on .
under the kyoto protocol limits , which have since been set in eu law , by 2010 germany must reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to a maximum total of 846 million tons , which includes emissions from private households , traffic , industry , and energy production .
trittin 's plan calls for the industry and energy sectors alone to implement a 1.5 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions each year down to 480 million tons compared to 1998 's 508 million . dw staff -lrb- dsl -rrb- with reporting by jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greater prosperity need not lead to higher emissions dw 's john hay spoke with sergey kononov of the unfccc 's implementation programme and asked him just where the world is heading with regard to greenhouse gases .

so far , german chancellor gerhard schröder has not stepped in to mediate .

industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .
" we can hardly still go along with it , " said regine günther , a climate expert for the world wide fund for nature .
" industry got everything , i mean everything , they demanded .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .

industry : plan goes further than we agreed one reason companies are unhappy with trittin 's plan is that it orders companies to eliminate an additional 7.5 percent in emissions on top of climate protection measures they have already volunteered to implement .
as a justification for the new caps , trittin has reminded companies of their july 2002 agreement to a voluntary deal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 45 million tons by 2010 .
industry , however , claims the deal was premised on a government pledge that it would not burden companies with additional costs when it implemented the emissions voucher system .
environmental groups are also taking trittin to task , saying the proposal goes to the limits of what is environmentally acceptable .

as the eu goes ahead with a complex emissions allocation system that seeks to put a lid on greenhouse gases , germany has begun contentious negotiations with industry on how the pollution credits will be doled out . last week , german environment minister jürgen trittin unveiled the first public draft of his plan for the controversial allotments .
the proposal has not been greeted with open arms by industry leaders , who say it could put germany at a serious competitive disadvantage compared to other industrial nations with looser environmental regulations .
environmental groups have also criticized trittin 's plan , saying it would water down german climate protection goals already agreed to .
allotments involve a system of tradable emissions permits that allow companies that voluntarily reduce emissions below a certain level to sell the difference to others as unused " rights " to pollute .
an 8 percent reduction by 2012 in order to protect the world climate , the european union has committed to reducing emissions of greenhouse gases by 8 percent in the period between 2008 and 2012 , compared to 1990 levels .
in the long term , the eu has targeted a 70 percent reduction from 1990 levels .
it is seeking to achieve that goal by allotting emissions allowances to eu members who will then distribute them to companies , effectively creating a market in greenhouse emissions allowances .
the system is scheduled to take effect beginning in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.02.2004 german press review : compensation for late trains german editorial writers on wednesday saw plenty to criticize in the service provided by the german national railway company , deutsche bahn – despite its decision to compensate customers for delays . the mitteldeutsche zeitung in halle was very excited .
" at last !
passengers who have to wait hours for their train , or who miss their connection because of a delay , will in future , get at least some of their money back , " the paper wrote , maintaining that this is not only good for the consumer but also for the railway , and that it will motivate the train drivers to be more on time in future .
but the mitteldeutsche is pretty much alone in its enthusiasm .
most other papers criticized the compensation arrangements while taking the opportunity to slam deutsche bahn for its inefficiency .
" trains have become more expensive , less frequent , and often far too late , " complained the ostthüringer zeitung in gera , " and the compromise between the government and the deutsche bahn won ’ t change any of that . "
the eastern german paper argued that if a fine is to be effective it has to hurt , and it added , it will still be cheaper for the rail company to pay 20 percent of the ticket price in compensation than for it to make improvements to its timetable .
the rhein-neckar zeitung in heidelberg claimed 20 percent is not enough .
" anyone who misses their appointment in munich or hamburg because their train was late won ’ t be comforted by a mere 10 euros , " it remarked .
but the paper pointed out that on the other hand , " you don ’ t demand a refund on your car tax if you get stuck in a traffic jam on the motorway . "
" it doesn ’ t matter how generous the compensation is , " wrote the stuttgarter zeitung .
" we ’ d far rather have trains that ran on time . "
the paper believes that , given its terrible reputation , this has to be deutsche bahn ’ s first priority – which means it needs modern signal technology , new trains , and fewer closures due to repair work .
the paper said if the government cuts investment this will inevitably result in trains being late .
it would be a major success if wind and weather were to be the only reasons for delays – factors which the deutsche bahn can ’ t do anything about , wrote the paper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

passengers who have to wait hours for their train , or who miss their connection because of a delay , will in future , get at least some of their money back , " the paper wrote , maintaining that this is not only good for the consumer but also for the railway , and that it will motivate the train drivers to be more on time in future .

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

a german battleship that terrorized the south atlantic during the early days of world war ii is to begin its journey back to the surface from its resting place off the coast of uruguay this week . a multimillion euro effort to raise a german battleship that has lain at the bottom of the river plate estuary in uruguay since it sank during world war ii will begin this week , weather conditions permitting .
salvage work to exhume large segments of the admiral graf spee from the silt in which it has resided for the best part of 60 years is expected to start either on thursday or friday .
the start depends on the status of the high winds and choppy waters which are making preparations difficult on the broad waterway separating uruguay from argentina .
crippled during battle of the river plate once a vessel feared by the british navy , the graf spee was regarded as a symbol of german naval might early in the war , as it prowled the south atlantic chasing and sinking as many as nine allied merchant ships while always allowing the crews time to evacuate the ships .
it was crippled by british warships on december 13 , 1939 , in one of the fiercest opening naval exchanges of world war ii . the pocket battleship - smaller , lighter versions of conventional warships which were designed to outrun battleships and outgun heavy cruisers - limped into montevideo harbor after it had received several direct hits .
it was pursued into the river plate estuary by a british battle group consisting of the british light cruisers hms exeter and hms ajax , and the hms achilles of new zealand . under the international conventions of the time , a damaged vessel had a total of 72 hours to make necessary repairs while sheltering in a neutral harbour .
after being allowed to bury their dead , the crew of the graf spee was unable to salvage the battleship in the time allowed and , under intense pressure from britain , neutral uruguay forced the graf spee to set out to sea once more . captain 's decision to sink the graf spee ship ’ s captain hans langsdorff decided that , instead of facing capture or destruction at the hands of the allied battle group , he would take the ship and sink it .
evacuating his crew onto ships bound for argentina , langsdorff scuttled the graf spee in waters less than 25 feet deep on december 17th before rejoining his shipmates in buenos aires .
langsdorff committed suicide two days later .
very few of the battleship ’ s crew are still alive and only octogenarians in the uruguayan capital of montevideo can recall the memory of seeing the battle of the river plate unfold just seven kilometers off their sleepy shores .
but the battle and the story of the graf spee is well documented , as much for the demise of such a revolutionary and innovative vessel as the ferocity of the conflict .
a historical example of naval innovation " it was a masterpiece in its time , " said mensun bound , a marine archaeologist from oxford university who is co-ordinating the project with uruguayan salvage expert hector bado , in an interview with argentine newspaper , clarin .
“ and it does n't have a dark history .
its captain was a man of great dignity and honour .
it was a battle in which both sides came out with their honour intact . ”
after the partners discovered that the wreck was in better shape than first thought back in 1997 , plans were drawn up to raise the ship a bit at a time .
bado said the recovery team would first try to remove a 27-ton communications tower equipped with early radar and what was then sophisticated sighting equipment for its 11-inch guns . “ the radar was one of the first to be used in that era , ” said bado , whose group has private funding and uruguayan government backing for the operation which could take years .
“ -lrb- the graf spee -rrb- will be rebuilt on land and will be the best ship museum in the world , " said bado .

berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .
touching stars , high cuddling factor – it ’ s all been done . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made it !
my own favorite berlinale moment ?
happened three years ago .
on the spur of the moment i went to the last screening of the festival and met friends in an a-list spot in the ticket line .
i got in and watched “ 2001 : a space odyssey . ”
afterwards , they handed out the berlinale awards in front of the screen where kubrick ’ s masterpiece had just been shown .

berlin ’ s 54th international film festival may have lost a few movies to its french rival in cannes , but there ’ s still plenty to see with almost 400 films scheduled to screen during the ten-day event starting feb .
5 . nicole kidman wo n't be coming to berlin after all , but celebrities are still bound to crowd the berlin festival ’ s red carpets to promote their movies : jack nicholson and nick nolte are expected to show up , cate blanchett and juliette binoche will drop by as well . focus on south africa and latin america the french actress binoche stars in “ country of my skull , ” a movie about south africa ’ s truth and reconciliation commission .
the film is one of 23 productions competing for the festival ’ s top honor , the golden bear , which is awarded by an international jury under the presidency of oscar-winning actress frances mcdormand this year . the berlinale ’ s special focus this year is on south africa as the country celebrates the tenth anniversary of the end of apartheid .
latin america will also receive extra attention : argentine director fernando solanas will receive an honorary golden bear for life-time achievement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from " maria , llena eres de gracia " in the competition , his countryman daniel burman ’ s “ el abrazo partido ” -lrb- lost embrace -rrb- focuses on a life in a seedy buenos aires shopping center .
the u.s.-colombian co-production “ maria , llena eres de gracia ” -lrb- maria full of grace , photo -rrb- by joshua marston , which just won the dramatic audience award at the sundance film festival , tells the story of a young woman who becomes a drug runner to escape life on a flower plantation . festival organizers , who received 3,117 submissions this year , also included two german movies in the competition : “ gegen die wand ” -lrb- head-on -rrb- by turkish-german director fatih akin and “ die nacht singt ihre lieder ” -lrb- nightsongs -rrb- by romuald karmakar . u.s. competition entries are patty jenkins ’ “ monster ” with golden globe winner charlize theron , richard linklater ’ s “ before sunset , ” and ron howard ’ s “ the missing . ”
the winner will be announced on feb .
14 . talents , markets , retrospectives apart from the competition , the festival also includes a range of other events such as a short film festival , a section for upcoming art house movies called panorama and screenings of the latest offerings in “ german cinema . ”
the traditional children ’ s film festival has been expanded to include movies for those 14 and older . this year ’ s retrospective is called “ new hollywood 1967 – 1976 : trouble in wonderland ” and includes classics such as martin scorcese ’ s “ taxi driver , ” francis ford coppola ’ s “ the godfather i / ii ” and dennis hopper ’ s “ easy rider . ”
another retrospective entitled “ selling democracy – welcome mr. marshall ” shows post-world war ii productions aimed at creating support for u.s. reconstruction efforts . berlinale organizers have also invited 520 film makers from 84 countries to attend the so-called talent campus , where they will work with accomplished colleagues such as “ cold mountain ” director anthony minghella , cinematographer michael ballhaus -lrb- “ gangs of new york ” -rrb- and composer zbigniew preisner -lrb- “ blue , ” “ white , ” “ red , ” -rrb- among others .
some participants will also be given a chance to market their own films in the festival ’ s new co-production market , which brings them together with producers and financers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director dieter kosslick at monday 's berlinale press conference .
another event is called “ hollywood in nigeria ” : it looks at the west african country ’ s booming movie industry , where about 1,200 films are produced each year .
“ we thought that africa ’ s been a little underexposed , ” festival director dieter kosslick said , adding that nigerian movie makers had offered to produce films specifically for each of the festival ’ s categories . three go to cannes unlike their nigerian colleagues , three other film makers and production companies decided to pull out their movies from the festival and sent them to cannes later in the spring even as berlinale programs were already getting printed . kosslick admitted to losing some sleep over the loss of walter salles ’ “ the motorcycle diaries , ” based on the journal of revolutionary che guevara .
but referring to the berlinale ’ s rivalry with its more glamorous french counterpart , he added that this was just proof of the high quality of berlinale films . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale log : " and the winner is ...

some participants will also be given a chance to market their own films in the festival ’ s new co-production market , which brings them together with producers and financers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : festival director dieter kosslick at monday 's berlinale press conference .
another event is called “ hollywood in nigeria ” : it looks at the west african country ’ s booming movie industry , where about 1,200 films are produced each year .
“ we thought that africa ’ s been a little underexposed , ” festival director dieter kosslick said , adding that nigerian movie makers had offered to produce films specifically for each of the festival ’ s categories . three go to cannes unlike their nigerian colleagues , three other film makers and production companies decided to pull out their movies from the festival and sent them to cannes later in the spring even as berlinale programs were already getting printed . kosslick admitted to losing some sleep over the loss of walter salles ’ “ the motorcycle diaries , ” based on the journal of revolutionary che guevara .
but referring to the berlinale ’ s rivalry with its more glamorous french counterpart , he added that this was just proof of the high quality of berlinale films . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale log : " and the winner is ...

berlin ’ s film festival is a glamorous affair , but not for this average movie-fan , who is having a tough time getting access .
a not completely serious berlinale survival guide . geographically speaking , the berlinale is the northeasternmost a-list film festival .
the location has few ramifications for the program , but many for the festival ’ s climate .
in 1978 , the then-berlinale director decided to move his show from early summer to february . this proved to be a wise step in terms of getting publicity mainly because no other european film festival takes place in winter .
but at what price ?
it ’ s usually bitter cold in berlin in february , which is probably why the berlinale mainly takes place inside .
there ’ s no festival promenade , but a high cuddling factor instead . antifreeze for the movie theater a few years ago , quite a number of festival-lovers dropped the intellectual black dress code for a more cheerful affirmation of all things colorful .
there ’ s clearly no better way than winter accessories to brighten things up : caps , scarves , gloves , knitted things to throw around you .
as wardrobes on deposit still haven ’ t achieved hip-dom , this stuff – along with woolen coats and down jackets – gets dragged inside the theater , where it ’ s strategically placed around the seat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's cold in berlin .
anyone arriving late to claim his seat in the middle of a row is therefore forced to climb over these mountains of “ antifreeze ” and has to endure evil snarls for stepping on precious gucci shawls .
but there ’ s no point in engaging in a berliner ’ s stereotypically favorite past-time – complaining .
think positive : just like at home , watching a movie at the berlinale guarantees entertainment with a “ blanket ” for cuddling on the side . but we ’ ve still got a long way to go to get there .
choosing a film , or putting together a list of personal favorites , is the first hurdle .
fortunately there ’ s the berlinale magazine with short introductions to all the movies to make things easier .
the berlinale-berliner grabs it and rushes to one of the many café-latte-islands to show it off and comprise a wish list . a lot of people already start getting depressed at this point as they remember that they ’ ve once again failed to get a press pass .
that ’ s a sure way to be kept out of the a-list events , leaving only the hope of pushing aside the mouth-protecting scarf and screaming at celebrities on the red carpet from afar . socialist ticket lines buying the tickets is best described as pure torture .
grab your magazine and pen , race to one of the berlinale ticket booths , despair for a moment over lines reminiscent of those common under socialist rule , take up position 128 and start waiting .
while doing so , the snow on your feet will turn to small puddles around your shoes and leave ugly marks on the leather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : standing in line is a favorite berlinale activity .
it ’ s time for a reality check : most films will be sold out – ticket sellers will let you know by crossing out the movie title with red ink .
be prepared to experience this several times while waiting .
once you ’ ve reached the front of the line , it ’ s possible that the last film on your wish list has just received the red cross treatment . but you ’ re not about to leave without a ticket and end up taking anything – some b-movie that will make you wonder afterwards why so many people went to see it -lrb- until you start recognizing people who were waiting in line with you -rrb- .
again , think positive : the whole standing-in-line-business gives you plenty of opportunities to flirt – and end up getting some cuddling of your own . is weimar more sophisticated ? as a berliner , one is always eager to bring some culture to those less fortunate and invites friends from the provinces to experience the metropolitan berlinale .
better be careful .
for reasons stated above , tickets for a – supposedly excellent – lesbian pirate movie are the only ones left in this particular case , which involves a visitor from the culturally-sophisticated eastern german town of weimar . the movie turns out to star a lot of hormonally-bred moustaches on rather rough female upper lips .
the sound could be better , the air conditioning isn ’ t working and blankets and similar devices don ’ t help to stay awake .
“ did you enjoy it , ” one cautiously asks the non-berliner after the credits .
“ the jury at the student film festival in weimar decided not to show this film , ” comes the proud answer .
ouch ! celebrity sightings are another berlinale dream .
meeting a-list stars is out of the question for the average festival-goer , but those ranking a few letters below are attainable .
even that ’ s not completely without risk .
stuck again with left-over tickets , you ’ re sitting in yet another fetish movie .
this time the director shows how californians get all sorts of things shoved through ear lobes , mouths and other skin parts .
the companion , who has disappeared underneath a blanket in his seat , is surprisingly excited about this , ends up talking to the director and doesn ’ t surface again for a day .

thanks to his run for the vice presidency alongside al gore in 2000 , many americans at least had a vague idea of who he was .
and in the crowded field of nine candidates vying for the democratic party nomination , name recognition is no mean thing .
but it was not enough to launch him ahead in any of the early primaries or caucuses , and he pulled out of the race after failing to make any impact in the super seven votes on 3 february .
religious questions he sold himself as the least left-wing of all the democrat candidates .
he liked to joke he was from the electable wing of the democratic party .
he campaigned as a centrist who he said will appeal not only to the base of his party but also to independent voters and even some republicans .
joe lieberman facts 1942 : born in stamford , connecticut 1970 : elected to connecticut state senate 1983 : elected as connecticut attorney general 1989 : wins bid for us senate 2000 : first jewish candidate for vice president better known than his politics though is his religion : senator lieberman is an orthodox jew .
in this most religiously tolerant of countries his jewishness raises few eyebrows , though it does lead to the odd question about how he would handle the middle east .
at a campaign stop at a cafe in new hampshire , one voter asked mr lieberman : " how are we going to stop the muslim countries from looking at you as an orthodox jew and not as a president ? "
the senator says that when he travels to the middle east , " i 'm greeted as an american senator who happens to be jewish . "
household name ' despite his strong showing in national polls based on his name recognition , senator lieberman was stuck in the middle tier of candidates .
voters were unenthused by lieberman 's campaign " he 's got enough money to survive .
he 's got the respect to survive , " says journalist david lightman .
but , he adds , his moderate views are not necessarily what play well with democrat voters .
and that is certainly true when it comes to the issue of iraq , a war many grassroots democrats opposed but which senator lieberman strongly supported .
when he launched his campaign in january 2003 , the senator said he was grateful to president bush for focusing on iraq and saddam hussein .
this time the senator and his party headed in different directions .

and in the crowded field of nine candidates vying for the democratic party nomination , name recognition is no mean thing .
but it was not enough to launch him ahead in any of the early primaries or caucuses , and he pulled out of the race after failing to make any impact in the super seven votes on 3 february .
religious questions he sold himself as the least left-wing of all the democrat candidates .
he liked to joke he was from the electable wing of the democratic party .
he campaigned as a centrist who he said will appeal not only to the base of his party but also to independent voters and even some republicans .

at a campaign stop at a cafe in new hampshire , one voter asked mr lieberman : " how are we going to stop the muslim countries from looking at you as an orthodox jew and not as a president ? "
the senator says that when he travels to the middle east , " i 'm greeted as an american senator who happens to be jewish . "

voters were unenthused by lieberman 's campaign " he 's got enough money to survive .

but , he adds , his moderate views are not necessarily what play well with democrat voters .
and that is certainly true when it comes to the issue of iraq , a war many grassroots democrats opposed but which senator lieberman strongly supported .
when he launched his campaign in january 2003 , the senator said he was grateful to president bush for focusing on iraq and saddam hussein .

an insurance expert outlines some easy steps you can take to cut premiums .
motor insurance can be expensive , and the biggest factors that influence your premium are age , gender and where you live .
of course , these are things you can not easily alter , but as with all insurance , these are not the only factors that influence your premium .
there are many things that you can actively do to help reduce your motor insurance costs .
pay a higher excess many insurers will insist on a minimum amount that you have to contribute to any claim .
this is commonly called an excess payment .
as a rule of thumb , insurers ask mature drivers to contribute £ 50 or £ 100 towards the cost of a claim while younger drivers can often be asked to pay more .
by offering to pay a higher excess , you can cut your premium substantially .
protect your no-claims bonus a full no-claims bonus can knock up to two-thirds off an insurance premium .
if you have a garage then use it ... your car is less likely to be stolen from your garage or from your drive than if it is parked in the street many drivers find that after they have made a claim their premiums increase dramatically , in part because they have lost their no-claims bonus .
if you have a no claims bonus , ask your insurer whether you can pay a small additional premium to protect this bonus .
although it may add to the cost initially , it will give you peace of mind that you can still make a major claim without sending your premiums rocketing the following year .
clubbing together membership of clubs , societies and trade unions can give you access to some special deals .
it is worth digging out any newsletters and literature to see what is available before you buy elsewhere .
many companies will give you another discount if you already have insurance with them .
for example , norwich union direct will discount your car insurance by 10 % if you have a home insurance policy with them .
named drivers add a named older driver to your insurance policy .
if your parents will occasionally drive your car then adding them as named additional drivers can save you another 10 % on your premium .
likewise , remove any younger named drivers if they will no longer be driving your car from time to time .
security fit extra security to your vehicle .
thatcham-approved alarms are recognised by all insurers and most will discount your premium if you have these fitted .
when you come to renew your policy , do not accept the price offered by your insurer at face value - shop around if you have a garage then use it .
your car is less likely to be stolen from your garage or from your drive than if it is parked in the street .
insurance companies recognise this and charge you less .
pay your premium in one go most insurers will charge you interest of around 15 % apr to allow you to pay your premium in monthly instalments .
however , some insurers charge up to 30 % interest for paying in monthly instalments , making it a very expensive form of credit .
all in all , it is much cheaper to pay your premium in one lump sum .
improve your driving skills consider taking an advanced driving course as many insurers will offer a reduced premium for better qualified drivers .
however , you should research the possible savings taking an advanced driving course will bring before committing to the cost .
shop around the average customer can save 35 % on their insurance premium by simply comparing several insurance companies against each other , according to the association of british insurers .
when you come to renew your policy , do not accept the price offered by your insurer at face value - shop around .
even if you feel loathe to switch insurer you should still see if you can get a better quote and give your current insurer the chance to beat it .
the views expressed are solely those of mr mason and are for general information only .

an insurance expert outlines some easy steps you can take to cut premiums .
motor insurance can be expensive , and the biggest factors that influence your premium are age , gender and where you live .
of course , these are things you can not easily alter , but as with all insurance , these are not the only factors that influence your premium .
there are many things that you can actively do to help reduce your motor insurance costs .
pay a higher excess many insurers will insist on a minimum amount that you have to contribute to any claim .
this is commonly called an excess payment .
as a rule of thumb , insurers ask mature drivers to contribute £ 50 or £ 100 towards the cost of a claim while younger drivers can often be asked to pay more .
by offering to pay a higher excess , you can cut your premium substantially .
protect your no-claims bonus a full no-claims bonus can knock up to two-thirds off an insurance premium .
if you have a garage then use it ... your car is less likely to be stolen from your garage or from your drive than if it is parked in the street many drivers find that after they have made a claim their premiums increase dramatically , in part because they have lost their no-claims bonus .
if you have a no claims bonus , ask your insurer whether you can pay a small additional premium to protect this bonus .
although it may add to the cost initially , it will give you peace of mind that you can still make a major claim without sending your premiums rocketing the following year .
clubbing together membership of clubs , societies and trade unions can give you access to some special deals .
it is worth digging out any newsletters and literature to see what is available before you buy elsewhere .
many companies will give you another discount if you already have insurance with them .
for example , norwich union direct will discount your car insurance by 10 % if you have a home insurance policy with them .
named drivers add a named older driver to your insurance policy .
if your parents will occasionally drive your car then adding them as named additional drivers can save you another 10 % on your premium .
likewise , remove any younger named drivers if they will no longer be driving your car from time to time .
security fit extra security to your vehicle .
thatcham-approved alarms are recognised by all insurers and most will discount your premium if you have these fitted .
when you come to renew your policy , do not accept the price offered by your insurer at face value - shop around if you have a garage then use it .
your car is less likely to be stolen from your garage or from your drive than if it is parked in the street .
insurance companies recognise this and charge you less .
pay your premium in one go most insurers will charge you interest of around 15 % apr to allow you to pay your premium in monthly instalments .
however , some insurers charge up to 30 % interest for paying in monthly instalments , making it a very expensive form of credit .
all in all , it is much cheaper to pay your premium in one lump sum .
improve your driving skills consider taking an advanced driving course as many insurers will offer a reduced premium for better qualified drivers .
however , you should research the possible savings taking an advanced driving course will bring before committing to the cost .
shop around the average customer can save 35 % on their insurance premium by simply comparing several insurance companies against each other , according to the association of british insurers .
when you come to renew your policy , do not accept the price offered by your insurer at face value - shop around .

ding junhui , who is just 16 and is playing on the major circuit for the first time , is already being tipped as a star by some of the biggest names in the snooker world .
" i believe ding will be world champion one day , " said ronnie o 'sullivan .
ding , the youngest ever player to compete at the conference centre in the 29-year history of the competition , defeated world number 16 joe perry , from chatteris , cambridgeshire , 6-3 on monday .
i have been playing the game for pretty much 20 years now and i have never seen anything like it peter ebdon but on tuesday night he took on world number five stephen lee in the second round and was defeated 6-5 .
snooker is very popular in china and ding took up the game at the age of nine when he had nothing to do at his home in shanghai .

the snooker sensation , who now practices up to eight hours a day , admits : " sometimes it is tiring .
" but i have to push myself if i want to become world champion one day . "

help the aged said council tax bills had increased by 80 % since 1993 - twice the rise in the state pension .
its petition will urge ministers to set up an expert body to examine the fairness of the existing system and look at the viability of replacements .
the scottish executive said it was committed to reviewing the tax .
a spokesman said the partnership agreement struck after last year 's election contained a promise to review local government finance - and that the council tax would form part of that process .
local authorities north of the border are preparing to set their bills for 2004/2005 next week .
deputy environment minister allan wilson announced details of water charges - which will fall by 3.4 % for customers in the north of scotland but rise by 5.1 % in the east and west - on tuesday .
pensioners south of the border have already shown their opposition to the current system .
last month a 35,000-strong petition calling for an end to the tax was handed in to downing street . "
the forthcoming review of local government finance provides the perfect forum to consider how the system could be improved " stuart hay help the aged help the aged 's scottish petition , which will be officially launched later this month , is seeking the support of major pensioners ' groups across the country .
the petition will say that pensioners are being " unfairly discriminated against " under the council tax compared with other households .
it calls for the establishment of an independent expert body , as part of the review of local government finance , to consider the fairness of the existing tax and possible replacements .
the aim is to submit the document to holyrood 's petitions committee .
a report for help the aged suggested that the council tax had risen by 80 % in scotland in the decade since its introduction in 1993 .
in the same period , the basic state pension rose by 40 % .
tax on income the rise in charges topped 90 % if water and sewerage bills were added into the equation , the report found .
last year 's average 3.9 % increase in council tax bills across scotland compared with a 2.5 % rise in pensions .
stuart hay , help the aged 's policy and parliamentary officer , said that the average council tax bill was equivalent to 25.5 % of the state pension - compared with less than 4 % of gross annual earnings .
figures for 2001/2002 suggested that council tax bills accounted for 5 % of pensioner households ' income , compared with 3 % for non-pensioner households .
mr hay said : " this has the same impact as making pensioners pay 2p tax on their income . "
research suggested that the take-up rate for council tax benefits was about 65 % among pensioners , falling to 45 % among those who owned their own homes .
mr hay said that meant that up to 148,000 pensioners may not be receiving what they are entitled to - which could add up to £ 58.5m in lost benefits .
" the forthcoming review of local government finance provides the perfect forum to consider how the system could be improved or whether there is a case for comprehensive reform or introducing new forms of taxation , " he said .
the isitfair campaign is also organising a petition in scotland , calling for the scrapping of the council tax .
range of issues an executive spokesman said a commitment had been given to review local government finance .
" that will take a look at a whole range of issues , including the council tax , " he said .
it is expected that the review will look at alternatives to the council tax , in addition to the existing system .

help the aged said council tax bills had increased by 80 % since 1993 - twice the rise in the state pension .
its petition will urge ministers to set up an expert body to examine the fairness of the existing system and look at the viability of replacements .
the scottish executive said it was committed to reviewing the tax .
a spokesman said the partnership agreement struck after last year 's election contained a promise to review local government finance - and that the council tax would form part of that process .
tell us how the council tax affects you ?
local authorities north of the border are preparing to set their bills for 2004/2005 next week .
deputy environment minister allan wilson announced details of water charges - which will fall by 3.4 % for customers in the north of scotland but rise by 5.1 % in the east and west - on tuesday .
pensioners south of the border have already shown their opposition to the current system .
last month a 35,000-strong petition calling for an end to the tax was handed in to downing street .
the forthcoming review of local government finance provides the perfect forum to consider how the system could be improved stuart hay help the aged help the aged 's scottish petition , which will be officially launched later this month , is seeking the support of major pensioners ' groups across the country .
the petition will say that pensioners are being " unfairly discriminated against " under the council tax compared with other households .
it calls for the establishment of an independent expert body , as part of the review of local government finance , to consider the fairness of the existing tax and possible replacements .
the aim is to submit the document to holyrood 's petitions committee .
a report for help the aged suggested that the council tax had risen by 80 % in scotland in the decade since its introduction in 1993 .
in the same period , the basic state pension rose by 40 % .
tax on income the rise in charges topped 90 % if water and sewerage bills were added into the equation , the report found .
last year 's average 3.9 % increase in council tax bills across scotland compared with a 2.5 % rise in pensions .
stuart hay , help the aged 's policy and parliamentary officer , said that the average council tax bill was equivalent to 25.5 % of the state pension - compared with less than 4 % of gross annual earnings .
figures for 2001/2002 suggested that council tax bills accounted for 5 % of pensioner households ' income , compared with 3 % for non-pensioner households .
council tax bills have risen faster than pensions mr hay said : " this has the same impact as making pensioners pay 2p tax on their income . "
research suggested that the take-up rate for council tax benefits was about 65 % among pensioners , falling to 45 % among those who owned their own homes .
mr hay said that meant that up to 148,000 pensioners may not be receiving what they are entitled to - which could add up to £ 58.5m in lost benefits .
" the forthcoming review of local government finance provides the perfect forum to consider how the system could be improved or whether there is a case for comprehensive reform or introducing new forms of taxation , " he said .
the isitfair campaign is also organising a petition in scotland , calling for the scrapping of the council tax .
range of issues an executive spokesman said a commitment had been given to review local government finance .
" that will take a look at a whole range of issues , including the council tax , " he said .
it is expected that the review will look at alternatives to the council tax , in addition to the existing system .

john kerry : front runner but not outright winner the night confirmed his status as front-runner but left room for john edwards to continue his challenge .
answering the criticism that he is a north-eastern liberal with limited appeal , john kerry has now shown that he can win across the nation - north , south , east and west .
the overriding issue in this election for democrats is who they believe can beat george bush .
and while mr edwards still has a chance , democrats will be looking to end this primary battle sooner rather than later so they can start the daunting task of challenging president bush .
choosing their battles until last week , john kerry had campaigned rarely in any of the five states he won on tuesday .
his victories were in large part due to the tremendous momentum he gained after his victories in the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primaries .
what are the super seven ?
seven states held primaries or caucuses : arizona delaware missouri new mexico north dakota oklahoma south carolina -lrb- click on state for profile -rrb- only registered democrat voters can take part the seven states represent more than 12 % of the delegates needed to claim the nomination election calendar candidates and issues the other candidates knew they could not match mr kerry blow for blow so they chose states where they thought they could make their stand .
the strategy worked well for john edwards .
he said that he had to win in his native state of south carolina - and win he did .
it just barely worked for wesley clark who squeaked out a victory in oklahoma just ahead of john edwards and john kerry .
the strategy failed miserably for joe lieberman who had pinned his hopes on a win in delaware , even though the small state would have been little more than a concession prize .
fallen front-runner howard dean , running low on money , chose in effect to bypass these states and make his stand in washington and michigan on saturday .
few believe he has much of a prayer , but he had written off tuesday 's races pre-emptively .
but the results were disappointing even with lowered expectations , finishing third in four of the races but a distant fifth in oklahoma and south carolina .
anybody but bush what is clearly emerging is that the democrats , above all , are looking for electability .
they desperately want to beat george bush .
there is great anger amongst the democrats .
in the primary , the democratic candidates have been fighting furiously against one another .
all the while , president bush 's approval numbers have been going down and down and down .
edwards will get a second look from democrats he is looking weaker , but is john kerry is the man to beat him ?
that is the question that democrats are still asking themselves .
and it is why john edwards still has a remote chance .
if there is a dark horse , he is the one .
people still question whether john kerry can energise the population to defeat george bush .
whereas , john edwards , with his charisma and his appeal in the south , has some voters still willing to gamble on him .
but voters may not have to choose .
there is a lot of talk about a kerry-edwards ticket .
the bush political machine while president bush is looking anaemic in the polls at present , he still has not wheeled out his big guns .
bush-cheney ' 04 remains a very daunting , potent political machine with a mountain of money .
while howard dean used to boast of his national political organisation , no democratic candidate has a truly nationwide organisation that can rival the president 's .
they have a huge hill to climb , which is why the powers that be in the democratic party would very much like this battle to be over so they can start the work of raising money and begin building a presence in key swing states .

chris woodhead , who lives close to ripple primary school near dover , says the consultation into its future has implications for all village schools .
kent county council has said the school , which has only 35 pupils , is not financially viable .
mr woodhead says the council needs to make a decision for the good of the entire county rather than one school .
i used to ask if the focus of the community was the church , shop , school or pub and always received different answers chris woodhead he said : " i was involved in discussions about small schools and they were always seen as essential to the community .
" i used to ask if the focus of the community was the church , shop , school or pub and always received different answers !
" but to be serious the school is very important to the survival of a rural community so this is an important issue not just for ripple but for the whole of kent .
" in principle i 'm on the side of diversity and the state giving the local community what they want but in practise that can only be done within the constraints of what is financially possible and kent county council can only do so much . "
a meeting to discuss the public consultation has been scheduled for 11 february .

quentin tarantino 's kill bill features both japanese swordplay and chinese martial arts - one of the many hollywood blockbusters that either borrows or steals from far eastern cinema .
not the first time tarantino has had this charge levelled against him - reservoir dogs was claimed to have large parts of it taken from the hong kong movie city of fire .
but as well as the two-part kill bill , other recent blockbusters which borrow heavily from the region include the last samurai , paycheck , and the concluding part of the matrix trilogy , the matrix revolutions - and that is just in the last few months .
the matrix series in particular is heavily influenced by the far east , and especially hong kong .
the fight scenes were choreographed by hong kong 's finest action director , yuen wo-ping .
much of the gunplay is taken from the films of john woo .
there is buddhism in the script .
indeed , the hero of the matrix films , neo anderson - played by keanu reeves - is strongly influenced by an ancient chinese figure , the wu xia warrior .
this was a supernatural knight , who first appeared in literature over 2,000 years ago .
the knight " is one who is morally upright , who possesses certain attributes " , cheng-sim lim , curator of the university of california , los angeles film archive told bbc world service 's masterpiece programme .
" they can jump tall buildings in a single leap , they can fly , they can shoot bolts of chi - the bodily force - out from the palms of their hands .
they can move huge boulders , and they can punch other people from a distance . "
legend the presence of such strong influences from just one city in so many films is remarkable - however it has surprising origins .
according to legend , kung fu was brought to china by an indian buddhist who settled in the north of the country in the tang dynasty , over 1,000 years ago .
he is said to have set up a shaolin temple , and taught martial arts to his disciples .
but the origins of the kung fu that is part of popular culture are from around 100 years ago when a soldier , who had learned from the shaolin monks , was forced to hide in a cantonese opera troupe .
it is said that eventually he taught the moves to the members .
" they ca n't use actual fighting on stage , so they transform it into some kind of dance-like action , " explained hong kong film archive programmer law kar .
" then the cantonese actors brought the tradition into chinese cinema .
" so in early cantonese cinema , in the 1960s and even in the 1970s , the scenes of fighting in films are in fact opera-stage fighting .
they 're not real kung fu . "
instead , the kung fu seen on screen is more balletic , and based on movement .
cheng-sim lim said that this was what made it exciting on film - and why it had proved so influential .
" there is a clarity to the way they construct these scenes , " she said .
" you do n't just move the camera in a blur to suggest action - you actually show the action .
" that 's what 's so incredible , because you see people - even though they may be wearing wires and all that kind of stuff - you see the body in motion , and it 's beautiful . "
' romantic ' far eastern cinema first become popular in the us as a result of world war ii , when a number of american gis were stationed in the pacific .
but the films really took off because of one man - the legendary bruce lee .
" in the 1960s and 1970s , you had the social movements for ethnic pride that followed the black civil rights movement of the 1950s , " cheng-sim lim said .
" you had a figure like bruce lee becoming really popular among african americans , and i think that happened because in bruce lee , a lot of minority communities in the us found a symbol of ethnic pride - in this self-assured asian man who could stand up to his oppressors . "
nowadays the influence of the region is so mainstream that jackie chan is a bona fide hollywood star , with comedies like rush hour and shanghai noon to his name .
director john woo , the name behind a number of hit hong kong films in the early 1990s , including the killer and hard-boiled , was lured by hollywood into shooting such films as mission impossible 2 , face / off and paycheck .
but both admit to themselves having had strong western influences .
chan has buster keaton as one of his heroes , while john woo is a big fan of alfred hitchcock .
" i love all of his movies , " he said recently in an interview about his film paycheck .
" i find in all hitchcock movies very romantic .
so i wanted also to make this movie romantic , and pretty much like a love story . "

quentin tarantino 's kill bill features both japanese swordplay and chinese martial arts - one of the many hollywood blockbusters that either borrows or steals from far eastern cinema .
not the first time tarantino has had this charge levelled against him - reservoir dogs was claimed to have large parts of it taken from the hong kong movie city of fire .
but as well as the two-part kill bill , other recent blockbusters which borrow heavily from the region include the last samurai , paycheck , and the concluding part of the matrix trilogy , the matrix revolutions - and that is just in the last few months .
the matrix series in particular is heavily influenced by the far east , and especially hong kong .
the fight scenes were choreographed by hong kong 's finest action director , yuen wo-ping .
much of the gunplay is taken from the films of john woo .
there is buddhism in the script .
indeed , the hero of the matrix films , neo anderson - played by keanu reeves - is strongly influenced by an ancient chinese figure , the wu xia warrior .
this was a supernatural knight , who first appeared in literature over 2,000 years ago .
the knight " is one who is morally upright , who possesses certain attributes " , cheng-sim lim , curator of the university of california , los angeles film archive told bbc world service 's masterpiece programme .
" they can jump tall buildings in a single leap , they can fly , they can shoot bolts of chi - the bodily force - out from the palms of their hands .
they can move huge boulders , and they can punch other people from a distance . "
legend the presence of such strong influences from just one city in so many films is remarkable - however it has surprising origins .
the matrix series borrows heavily from china according to legend , kung fu was brought to china by an indian buddhist who settled in the north of the country in the tang dynasty , over 1,000 years ago .
he is said to have set up a shaolin temple , and taught martial arts to his disciples .
but the origins of the kung fu that is part of popular culture are from around 100 years ago when a soldier , who had learned from the shaolin monks , was forced to hide in a cantonese opera troupe .
it is said that eventually he taught the moves to the members .
" they ca n't use actual fighting on stage , so they transform it into some kind of dance-like action , " explained hong kong film archive programmer law kar .
" then the cantonese actors brought the tradition into chinese cinema .
" so in early cantonese cinema , in the 1960s and even in the 1970s , the scenes of fighting in films are in fact opera-stage fighting .
they 're not real kung fu . "
instead , the kung fu seen on screen is more balletic , and based on movement .
cheng-sim lim said that this was what made it exciting on film - and why it had proved so influential .
" there is a clarity to the way they construct these scenes , " she said .
" you do n't just move the camera in a blur to suggest action - you actually show the action .
" that 's what 's so incredible , because you see people - even though they may be wearing wires and all that kind of stuff - you see the body in motion , and it 's beautiful . "

under the dcp , australia is set to spend a total of $ 38bn , continuing a steady upward trend in defence funding .
mr hill said the dcp - the result of a 12-month review of the armed forces - also envisaged : replacing the army 's 40-year-old leopard tanks with the latest german leopard , the us abrams or the british challenger 2 acquiring three new destroyers and two new landing vessels ; upgrading the air force 's f / a-18 hornet fighter planes and acquiring a new airborne early warning and control aircraft the defence plan did not make specific provisions for australia 's participation in the controversial us missile defence shield project , but mr hill said canberra was " committed to the concept " .
" the global situation has also brought our responsibilities , as an alliance partner of the united states , into sharper focus , " he said .
australia - which recently has seen an unprecedented level of its troops deployments oversees - was one the staunchest allies of the us-led war in iraq last year .
capacity boost the dcp makes a six-fold increase in funding for a squadron of us-made northrop grumman global hawk unmanned aerial vehicles -lrb- uavs -rrb- which would patrol australia 's borders and could be used further afield .
australia says it is committed to the us missile defence shield " the success of the aircraft such as global hawk in operations over both iraq and afghanistan have demonstrated the huge capacity boost these assets can bring , " mr hill said .
" you can put an unmanned vehicle up that can travel for up to 24 hours over a huge distance , you can basically have a continual surveillance capability with a squadron , " he said .
mr hill added that the drones " would also be able to assist with civil tasks such as bush fire detection and response " .
no prime contractors for the new aircraft had been identified in the dcp , but the plan envisaged to have the drones operational between 2009-2011 .

the low-cost airline has been given discounted landing charges by newquay airport since it started services to cornwall in march 2002 .
but airport bosses claim the reduced rates have forced the airport into a £ 750,000 debt .
executive members of cornwall county council , which runs the airport , are expected to meet on wednesday to discuss the future of the airport .
north cornwall mp mr tyler , whose constituency includes newquay , said the deal with ryanair should never have been agreed .
we do n't want a subsidised airport which pours money into the profits of any one particular airline paul tyler , mp he said : " at the moment we are paying a huge amount so subsidise ryanair 's profits and their passenger fares and the only people that seem to be benefiting is ryanair .
" i am sure we would get another low-cost airline to come in , but bribing an airline to give us a cut-price deal does n't make long-term sense for the county .
" what we need are viable airlines with viable services and a viable airport .
" we do n't want a subsidised airport which pours money into the profits of any one particular airline . "
ec ruling the number of passengers at newquay has soared in the past two years , from 85,000 a year to nearly 250,000 .
it is estimated that the airport brought in more than £ 17m into the cornish economy last year .
but mr tyler said it should not be at the expense of council tax payers .
" i do n't think we should be in anyone 's pocket and we should be looking around at who can produce the best deal , not just for passengers going in and out of cornwall , but for the council tax payers in the county . "
mr tyler 's concerns follow a european commission ruling that subsidies paid to ryanair by a belgian airport are illegal .
ryanair has refused to comment on the future of the newquay to stansted service in the light of the ruling .

the ship went down in the barents sea 30 years ago but new technology has offered experts a better idea about the weather the ship experienced .
suspicions the vessel was being used to spy on soviet ships have been dismissed .
the ship went down in 1974 with the loss of all 36 men on board .
expert witnesses the model tests were conducted by marin , the maritime research institute of the netherlands .
the inquiry has been given a brief presentation of the model tests by the institute , but now expert witnesses will pick through the detailed findings .
after a survey of the gaul 's wreck on the sea bed in 2002 , experts were able to assess what state she was in .
they believe the waste chutes and factory access door were open on the surface , but it is unclear whether the engine room escape hatch or fish and net hatches fell open as she descended to the sea bed .
water tank experts are unclear whether the hatches were open to the storm on the day the ship went down .
using this information the marin team built a model with various openings allowing water to spill into the factory spaces of the model .
an underwater camera reveals the wheelhouse of the sunken gaul a water tank then simulated the waves and winds to the scales the gaul is likely to have encountered in february 1974 .
the inquiry has heard there has been speculation for more than 30 years on the possible cause of the gaul 's sinking and a belief that the ship had been seized by the soviet union and the crew imprisoned , or that the vessel had been torpedoed or accidentally sunk by a russian submarine .
most of the men who died on the gaul were from hull , but six were from north shields , tyne and wear , and one was from nelson , lancashire .
the reopened inquiry was ordered by deputy prime minister john prescott in 1999 , after the wreck of the gaul was found on the seabed and surveyed .
the first 1974 inquiry into the sinking concluded that the ship was overwhelmed by mountainous seas .

they have called in an expert - a sort of " elephant-whisperer " - from the united states to help them .
elke riesterer has done therapy on all sorts of animals , but elephants , she says , are among her favourites .
as she speaks she moves her hands over the rough , hairy flank of gangara , a huge bull elephant , one of 30 captive elephants living in a colony near the yamuna river in delhi .
the elephants are busy most days , working at wedding parties and celebrations , earning their mahouts up to $ 100 a day .
elke has been invited by the wildlife trust of india from her home in santa cruz in california to assess the stress levels of some of the thousands of captive elephants in india .
their hide may feel rough , but it 's incredibly sensitive to the touch elke riesterer gangara seems unconcerned by the attention he is getting .
elke runs her hands over his trunk and head and legs while gangara munches on a few sugar canes .
" i am keeping my hands on him and he 's getting more confident of my presence and he 's now leaning into my hands , " elke , a german national , told the bbc .
" this animal is very stressed .
i can tell that there 's something bothering him .
look at his eyes .
" he does n't look well , they are weeping .
i think there 's too much dust and this is not a good environment . "
poor health dr anand , a vet with the wildlife trust of india , says the condition of the elephants in delhi is very poor .
elke and gangara this animal is very stressed " they have a poor diet , poor water and they are kept standing around for far too long , chained by their back legs . "
the elephants in the indian capital live in a filthy environment beneath a bridge , over which runs a six-lane trunk road into the city .
many have been injured in accidents with cars and motorcycles in the mad bustle of delhi traffic .
they drink water and bathe in one of the most polluted rivers in india .
it is hardly surprising they are not in good condition .
dr anand says elephants in captivity elsewhere in india are also suffering .
he says some are in better condition than the delhi animals , but few are as fit or well as they should be .
touch therapy elke riesterer , who has been working on a project at oakland zoo in california , says she 's been asked to look at dozens of elephants in six cities across india .
the elephants are used for ceremonial purposes she will treat them with her touch therapy and give her diagnosis of their health .
the tellington touch therapy she practises was developed by a british woman , linda tellington jones , and it 's used widely in the equine world to calm and restore stressed horses .
elke riesterer says it works well on elephants as well .
" there 's a misconception that elephants have thick , insensitive skins , " she says .

they have called in an expert - a sort of " elephant-whisperer " - from the united states to help them .
elke riesterer has done therapy on all sorts of animals , but elephants , she says , are among her favourites .
as she speaks she moves her hands over the rough , hairy flank of gangara , a huge bull elephant , one of 30 captive elephants living in a colony near the yamuna river in delhi .
the elephants are busy most days , working at wedding parties and celebrations , earning their mahouts up to $ 100 a day .
elke has been invited by the wildlife trust of india from her home in santa cruz in california to assess the stress levels of some of the thousands of captive elephants in india . "
their hide may feel rough , but it 's incredibly sensitive to the touch " elke riesterer gangara seems unconcerned by the attention he is getting .
elke runs her hands over his trunk and head and legs while gangara munches on a few sugar canes .
" i am keeping my hands on him and he 's getting more confident of my presence and he 's now leaning into my hands , " elke told the bbc .
" this animal is very stressed .
i can tell that there 's something bothering him .
look at his eyes .
" he does n't look well , they are weeping .
i think there 's too much dust and this is not a good environment . "
poor health dr anand , a vet with the wildlife trust of india , says the condition of the elephants in delhi is very poor .
elke and gangara " this animal is very stressed " " they have a poor diet , poor water and they are kept standing around for far too long , chained by their back legs . "
the elephants in the indian capital live in a filthy environment beneath a bridge , over which runs a six-lane trunk road into the city .
many have been injured in accidents with cars and motorcycles in the mad bustle of delhi traffic .
they drink water and bathe in one of the most polluted rivers in india .
it is hardly surprising they are not in good condition .
dr anand says elephants in captivity elsewhere in india are also suffering .
he says some are in better condition than the delhi animals , but few are as fit or well as they should be .
touch therapy elke riesterer , who has been working on a project at oakland zoo in california , says she 's been asked to look at dozens of elephants in six cities across india .
she will treat them with her touch therapy and give her diagnosis of their health .
the tellington touch therapy she practises was developed by a british woman , linda tellington jones , and it 's used widely in the equine world to calm and restore stressed horses .
elke riesterer says it works well on elephants as well .
" there 's a misconception that elephants have thick , insensitive skins , " she says .
" their hide may feel rough , but it 's incredibly sensitive to the touch . "
