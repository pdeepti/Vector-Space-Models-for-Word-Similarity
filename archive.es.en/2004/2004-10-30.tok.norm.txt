dog lovers say the pass just wouldn ’ t be the same without them - ven if they do n't tote brandy . the highest church in europe lies in the swiss mountains .
the handful of augustine monks who live here see it as an oasis of tranquillity , where travelers can seek shelter and spiritual solace .
but for hundreds of years , this hospice has also been home to a dozen saint bernard dogs .
traditionally used to rescue people trapped by avalanches , they now attract thousands of tourists each year .
father ivan kull said they ’ ve become too much for the monks , though .
" we think we ’ ve got enough to do , caring for people here , " said kull .
" we don ’ t want to look after the dogs anymore .
it takes up too much time and it ’ s costly . "
so the monks declared they would sell them and were stunned by the response .
" absurd ! "
father ivan said the hospice has been besieged for weeks .
" everyone wants to know what we ’ re doing by selling the dogs , " he said .
" i ’ ve had calls every two minutes from people wanting to adopt them ; there are television crews on our doorstep .
it ’ s absurd . "
the st. bernards , however , have already been moved to their winter quarters down in the valley below the church .
the plan is to sell them as a group for breeding .
the price is rumored to be $ 800,000 -lrb- € 630,000 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the matterhorn in switzerland their handler bernard leger isn ’ t sure how long he ’ ll have a job .
he ’ s disappointed the monks want to sell .
" i love these dogs and i love my job , " said leger .
" they are big dogs , but very friendly , good with children , kind and gentle . "
contrary to popular belief , it 's actually been 50 years since a saint bernard rescued anyone lost in the snow .
at 80 kilograms -lrb- 175 pounds -rrb- , the breed is just too heavy for modern helicopters .
and that barrel of brandy around the dog ’ s neck is a myth .
no saint bernard ever carried one .
dogs = tourists the plans to sell the famous dogs puts more than just tradition at stake .
switzerland ’ s saint bernard region is not rich .
without thousands of tourists travelling up the pass to see the dogs , many locals believe their businesses will go under .
tourism director dominic fumeaux said the dogs must stay in the area .
" we are not prepared to let them go , " said fumeaux .
" it ’ s just too important .
we ’ ve got to find a solution even if we have to buy them ourselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks want to spend more time on the tourists and less on the dogs martine villetaz , who runs a hotel and gift shop on the road up to the pass , is already worrying .
she thinks the monks need to pay a bit more attention to the real world .
" the saint bernard is a symbol for everything swiss , " she said .
" it ’ s like the matterhorn and zermatt . "
according to villetaz , the region needs the st bernards .
" the monks can ’ t just think about religion , " she said .
" the dog is important for the economy and without it , i ’ m not sure we could survive . "
nothing to worry about the monks are surprised by the anger their plan 's have sarked among the locals .
father ivan said people are worrying unnecessarily .
" the saint bernards are not on the brink of extinction , " he said .
" there are plenty of them around the world and others in switzerland . "
the buyer would be required to bring the dogs up to the hospice every summer .
" so i don ’ t think there ’ s anything to worry about , " he said .
the hospice on the saint bernard pass is a thousand years old , and some things , like the daily calls to prayer , haven ’ t changed at all .
many hope the hospice ’ s most famous symbol won ’ t change either .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .
he said his party would also be prepared to work with the republikaner , another extreme-right party who have so far refused the offer of an alliance .
time for revolutionary change the npd shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern state of saxony last month , and is aiming to repeat that success on a national level in the 2006 parliamentary elections .
on saturday night , hardliners from the neo-nazi scene are expected to be voted into the national party leadership .
observers say the move is an effort by the npd , which has traditionally rejected links to neo-nazis , of tapping into the scene to form a " people 's front from the right , " as voigt put it .
addressing the conference in this small eastern town which was heavily guarded by police , voigt said : " the time has come for a revolutionary change in germany , and this process started in saxony . "
ambitious plans greeted with skepticism political scientists , however , do n't believe the right-wing party can repeat its success on a national level .
they say the lack of a cohesive party program and media support would doom the party , as would the lack of finances .
under the alliance with the dvu , the two parties will enter a joint list of candidates for the national elections and will not stand against each other .
only one extremist right-wing party has won seats in the bundestag lower house of parliament since world war ii and that was immediately after the war .
protesters fight police in protest against a neo-nazi march in potsdam on saturday , thousands of left-wing activists clashed with police officers .
the activists were there to protest the 350 neo-nazis who marched with police escort through downtown potsdam .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .
he said his party would also be prepared to work with the republikaner , another extreme-right party who have so far refused the offer of an alliance .
time for revolutionary change the npd shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern state of saxony last month , and is aiming to repeat that success on a national level in the 2006 parliamentary elections .
on saturday night , hardliners from the neo-nazi scene are expected to be voted into the national party leadership .

ambitious plans greeted with skepticism political scientists , however , do n't believe the right-wing party can repeat its success on a national level .
they say the lack of a cohesive party program and media support would doom the party , as would the lack of finances .
under the alliance with the dvu , the two parties will enter a joint list of candidates for the national elections and will not stand against each other .
only one extremist right-wing party has won seats in the bundestag lower house of parliament since world war ii and that was immediately after the war .
protesters fight police in protest against a neo-nazi march in potsdam on saturday , thousands of left-wing activists clashed with police officers .
the activists were there to protest the 350 neo-nazis who marched with police escort through downtown potsdam .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .
he said his party would also be prepared to work with the republikaner , another extreme-right party who have so far refused the offer of an alliance .
time for revolutionary change the npd shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern state of saxony last month , and is aiming to repeat that success on a national level in the 2006 parliamentary elections .
on saturday night , hardliners from the neo-nazi scene are expected to be voted into the national party leadership .
observers say the move is an effort by the npd , which has traditionally rejected links to neo-nazis , of tapping into the scene to form a " people 's front from the right , " as voigt put it .
addressing the conference in this small eastern town which was heavily guarded by police , voigt said : " the time has come for a revolutionary change in germany , and this process started in saxony . "
ambitious plans greeted with skepticism political scientists , however , do n't believe the right-wing party can repeat its success on a national level .
they say the lack of a cohesive party program and media support would doom the party , as would the lack of finances .
under the alliance with the dvu , the two parties will enter a joint list of candidates for the national elections and will not stand against each other .
only one extremist right-wing party has won seats in the bundestag lower house of parliament since world war ii and that was immediately after the war .
protesters fight police in protest against a neo-nazi march in potsdam on saturday , thousands of left-wing activists clashed with police officers .
the activists were there to protest the 350 neo-nazis who marched with police escort through downtown potsdam .
things quickly got out of hand and police had to beat back the anarchists with water cannons .

dog lovers say the pass just wouldn ’ t be the same without them - ven if they do n't tote brandy . the highest church in europe lies in the swiss mountains .
the handful of augustine monks who live here see it as an oasis of tranquillity , where travelers can seek shelter and spiritual solace .
but for hundreds of years , this hospice has also been home to a dozen saint bernard dogs .
traditionally used to rescue people trapped by avalanches , they now attract thousands of tourists each year .
father ivan kull said they ’ ve become too much for the monks , though .
" we think we ’ ve got enough to do , caring for people here , " said kull .
" we don ’ t want to look after the dogs anymore .
it takes up too much time and it ’ s costly . "
so the monks declared they would sell them and were stunned by the response .
" absurd ! "
father ivan said the hospice has been besieged for weeks .
" everyone wants to know what we ’ re doing by selling the dogs , " he said .
" i ’ ve had calls every two minutes from people wanting to adopt them ; there are television crews on our doorstep .
it ’ s absurd . "
the st. bernards , however , have already been moved to their winter quarters down in the valley below the church .
the plan is to sell them as a group for breeding .
the price is rumored to be $ 800,000 -lrb- € 630,000 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the matterhorn in switzerland their handler bernard leger isn ’ t sure how long he ’ ll have a job .
he ’ s disappointed the monks want to sell .
" i love these dogs and i love my job , " said leger .
" they are big dogs , but very friendly , good with children , kind and gentle . "
contrary to popular belief , it 's actually been 50 years since a saint bernard rescued anyone lost in the snow .
at 80 kilograms -lrb- 175 pounds -rrb- , the breed is just too heavy for modern helicopters .
and that barrel of brandy around the dog ’ s neck is a myth .
no saint bernard ever carried one .
dogs = tourists the plans to sell the famous dogs puts more than just tradition at stake .
switzerland ’ s saint bernard region is not rich .
without thousands of tourists travelling up the pass to see the dogs , many locals believe their businesses will go under .
tourism director dominic fumeaux said the dogs must stay in the area .
" we are not prepared to let them go , " said fumeaux .
" it ’ s just too important .
we ’ ve got to find a solution even if we have to buy them ourselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks want to spend more time on the tourists and less on the dogs martine villetaz , who runs a hotel and gift shop on the road up to the pass , is already worrying .
she thinks the monks need to pay a bit more attention to the real world .
" the saint bernard is a symbol for everything swiss , " she said .
" it ’ s like the matterhorn and zermatt . "
according to villetaz , the region needs the st bernards .
" the monks can ’ t just think about religion , " she said .
" the dog is important for the economy and without it , i ’ m not sure we could survive . "
nothing to worry about the monks are surprised by the anger their plan 's have sarked among the locals .
father ivan said people are worrying unnecessarily .
" the saint bernards are not on the brink of extinction , " he said .
" there are plenty of them around the world and others in switzerland . "
the buyer would be required to bring the dogs up to the hospice every summer .
" so i don ’ t think there ’ s anything to worry about , " he said .
the hospice on the saint bernard pass is a thousand years old , and some things , like the daily calls to prayer , haven ’ t changed at all .
many hope the hospice ’ s most famous symbol won ’ t change either .
but that will depend on finding a buyer who can afford the dogs , who will keep them in the region , breed them , and take them up to the pass summer after summer . imogen foulkes -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .
he said his party would also be prepared to work with the republikaner , another extreme-right party who have so far refused the offer of an alliance .
time for revolutionary change the npd shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern state of saxony last month , and is aiming to repeat that success on a national level in the 2006 parliamentary elections .
on saturday night , hardliners from the neo-nazi scene are expected to be voted into the national party leadership .
observers say the move is an effort by the npd , which has traditionally rejected links to neo-nazis , of tapping into the scene to form a " people 's front from the right , " as voigt put it .
addressing the conference in this small eastern town which was heavily guarded by police , voigt said : " the time has come for a revolutionary change in germany , and this process started in saxony . "
ambitious plans greeted with skepticism political scientists , however , do n't believe the right-wing party can repeat its success on a national level .
they say the lack of a cohesive party program and media support would doom the party , as would the lack of finances .
under the alliance with the dvu , the two parties will enter a joint list of candidates for the national elections and will not stand against each other .
only one extremist right-wing party has won seats in the bundestag lower house of parliament since world war ii and that was immediately after the war .
protesters fight police in protest against a neo-nazi march in potsdam on saturday , thousands of left-wing activists clashed with police officers .
the activists were there to protest the 350 neo-nazis who marched with police escort through downtown potsdam .
things quickly got out of hand and police had to beat back the anarchists with water cannons .

dog lovers say the pass just wouldn ’ t be the same without them - ven if they do n't tote brandy . the highest church in europe lies in the swiss mountains .
the handful of augustine monks who live here see it as an oasis of tranquillity , where travelers can seek shelter and spiritual solace .
but for hundreds of years , this hospice has also been home to a dozen saint bernard dogs .
traditionally used to rescue people trapped by avalanches , they now attract thousands of tourists each year .
father ivan kull said they ’ ve become too much for the monks , though .
" we think we ’ ve got enough to do , caring for people here , " said kull .
" we don ’ t want to look after the dogs anymore .
it takes up too much time and it ’ s costly . "
so the monks declared they would sell them and were stunned by the response .
" absurd ! "
father ivan said the hospice has been besieged for weeks .
" everyone wants to know what we ’ re doing by selling the dogs , " he said .
" i ’ ve had calls every two minutes from people wanting to adopt them ; there are television crews on our doorstep .
it ’ s absurd . "
the st. bernards , however , have already been moved to their winter quarters down in the valley below the church .
the plan is to sell them as a group for breeding .
the price is rumored to be $ 800,000 -lrb- € 630,000 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the matterhorn in switzerland their handler bernard leger isn ’ t sure how long he ’ ll have a job .
he ’ s disappointed the monks want to sell .
" i love these dogs and i love my job , " said leger .
" they are big dogs , but very friendly , good with children , kind and gentle . "
contrary to popular belief , it 's actually been 50 years since a saint bernard rescued anyone lost in the snow .
at 80 kilograms -lrb- 175 pounds -rrb- , the breed is just too heavy for modern helicopters .
and that barrel of brandy around the dog ’ s neck is a myth .
no saint bernard ever carried one .
dogs = tourists the plans to sell the famous dogs puts more than just tradition at stake .
switzerland ’ s saint bernard region is not rich .
without thousands of tourists travelling up the pass to see the dogs , many locals believe their businesses will go under .
tourism director dominic fumeaux said the dogs must stay in the area .
" we are not prepared to let them go , " said fumeaux .
" it ’ s just too important .
we ’ ve got to find a solution even if we have to buy them ourselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks want to spend more time on the tourists and less on the dogs martine villetaz , who runs a hotel and gift shop on the road up to the pass , is already worrying .
she thinks the monks need to pay a bit more attention to the real world .
" the saint bernard is a symbol for everything swiss , " she said .
" it ’ s like the matterhorn and zermatt . "
according to villetaz , the region needs the st bernards .
" the monks can ’ t just think about religion , " she said .
" the dog is important for the economy and without it , i ’ m not sure we could survive . "
nothing to worry about the monks are surprised by the anger their plan 's have sarked among the locals .
father ivan said people are worrying unnecessarily .
" the saint bernards are not on the brink of extinction , " he said .
" there are plenty of them around the world and others in switzerland . "
the buyer would be required to bring the dogs up to the hospice every summer .
" so i don ’ t think there ’ s anything to worry about , " he said .
the hospice on the saint bernard pass is a thousand years old , and some things , like the daily calls to prayer , haven ’ t changed at all .
many hope the hospice ’ s most famous symbol won ’ t change either .
but that will depend on finding a buyer who can afford the dogs , who will keep them in the region , breed them , and take them up to the pass summer after summer . imogen foulkes -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

dog lovers say the pass just wouldn ’ t be the same without them - ven if they do n't tote brandy . the highest church in europe lies in the swiss mountains .
the handful of augustine monks who live here see it as an oasis of tranquillity , where travelers can seek shelter and spiritual solace .
but for hundreds of years , this hospice has also been home to a dozen saint bernard dogs .
traditionally used to rescue people trapped by avalanches , they now attract thousands of tourists each year .
father ivan kull said they ’ ve become too much for the monks , though .
" we think we ’ ve got enough to do , caring for people here , " said kull .
" we don ’ t want to look after the dogs anymore .
it takes up too much time and it ’ s costly . "
so the monks declared they would sell them and were stunned by the response .
" absurd ! "
father ivan said the hospice has been besieged for weeks .
" everyone wants to know what we ’ re doing by selling the dogs , " he said .
" i ’ ve had calls every two minutes from people wanting to adopt them ; there are television crews on our doorstep .
it ’ s absurd . "
the st. bernards , however , have already been moved to their winter quarters down in the valley below the church .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .
he said his party would also be prepared to work with the republikaner , another extreme-right party who have so far refused the offer of an alliance .
time for revolutionary change the npd shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern state of saxony last month , and is aiming to repeat that success on a national level in the 2006 parliamentary elections .
on saturday night , hardliners from the neo-nazi scene are expected to be voted into the national party leadership .
observers say the move is an effort by the npd , which has traditionally rejected links to neo-nazis , of tapping into the scene to form a " people 's front from the right , " as voigt put it .
addressing the conference in this small eastern town which was heavily guarded by police , voigt said : " the time has come for a revolutionary change in germany , and this process started in saxony . "
ambitious plans greeted with skepticism political scientists , however , do n't believe the right-wing party can repeat its success on a national level .
they say the lack of a cohesive party program and media support would doom the party , as would the lack of finances .
under the alliance with the dvu , the two parties will enter a joint list of candidates for the national elections and will not stand against each other .
only one extremist right-wing party has won seats in the bundestag lower house of parliament since world war ii and that was immediately after the war .
protesters fight police in protest against a neo-nazi march in potsdam on saturday , thousands of left-wing activists clashed with police officers .
the activists were there to protest the 350 neo-nazis who marched with police escort through downtown potsdam .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.10.2004 switzerland 's famous saint bernards for sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times without tasso plans by the monks on switzerland 's saint bernard pass to sell their famous dogs has caused an uproar .
dog lovers say the pass just wouldn ’ t be the same without them - ven if they do n't tote brandy . the highest church in europe lies in the swiss mountains .
the handful of augustine monks who live here see it as an oasis of tranquillity , where travelers can seek shelter and spiritual solace .
but for hundreds of years , this hospice has also been home to a dozen saint bernard dogs .
traditionally used to rescue people trapped by avalanches , they now attract thousands of tourists each year .
father ivan kull said they ’ ve become too much for the monks , though .
" we think we ’ ve got enough to do , caring for people here , " said kull .
" we don ’ t want to look after the dogs anymore .
it takes up too much time and it ’ s costly . "
so the monks declared they would sell them and were stunned by the response .
" absurd ! "
father ivan said the hospice has been besieged for weeks .
" everyone wants to know what we ’ re doing by selling the dogs , " he said .
" i ’ ve had calls every two minutes from people wanting to adopt them ; there are television crews on our doorstep .
it ’ s absurd . "
the st. bernards , however , have already been moved to their winter quarters down in the valley below the church .
the plan is to sell them as a group for breeding .
the price is rumored to be $ 800,000 -lrb- € 630,000 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the matterhorn in switzerland their handler bernard leger isn ’ t sure how long he ’ ll have a job .
he ’ s disappointed the monks want to sell .
" i love these dogs and i love my job , " said leger .
" they are big dogs , but very friendly , good with children , kind and gentle . "
contrary to popular belief , it 's actually been 50 years since a saint bernard rescued anyone lost in the snow .
at 80 kilograms -lrb- 175 pounds -rrb- , the breed is just too heavy for modern helicopters .
and that barrel of brandy around the dog ’ s neck is a myth .
no saint bernard ever carried one .
dogs = tourists the plans to sell the famous dogs puts more than just tradition at stake .
switzerland ’ s saint bernard region is not rich .
without thousands of tourists travelling up the pass to see the dogs , many locals believe their businesses will go under .
tourism director dominic fumeaux said the dogs must stay in the area .
" we are not prepared to let them go , " said fumeaux .
" it ’ s just too important .
we ’ ve got to find a solution even if we have to buy them ourselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks want to spend more time on the tourists and less on the dogs martine villetaz , who runs a hotel and gift shop on the road up to the pass , is already worrying .
she thinks the monks need to pay a bit more attention to the real world .
" the saint bernard is a symbol for everything swiss , " she said .
" it ’ s like the matterhorn and zermatt . "
according to villetaz , the region needs the st bernards .
" the monks can ’ t just think about religion , " she said .
" the dog is important for the economy and without it , i ’ m not sure we could survive . "
nothing to worry about the monks are surprised by the anger their plan 's have sarked among the locals .
father ivan said people are worrying unnecessarily .
" the saint bernards are not on the brink of extinction , " he said .
" there are plenty of them around the world and others in switzerland . "
the buyer would be required to bring the dogs up to the hospice every summer .
" so i don ’ t think there ’ s anything to worry about , " he said .
the hospice on the saint bernard pass is a thousand years old , and some things , like the daily calls to prayer , haven ’ t changed at all .
many hope the hospice ’ s most famous symbol won ’ t change either .
but that will depend on finding a buyer who can afford the dogs , who will keep them in the region , breed them , and take them up to the pass summer after summer . imogen foulkes -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .
he said his party would also be prepared to work with the republikaner , another extreme-right party who have so far refused the offer of an alliance .
time for revolutionary change the npd shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern state of saxony last month , and is aiming to repeat that success on a national level in the 2006 parliamentary elections .
on saturday night , hardliners from the neo-nazi scene are expected to be voted into the national party leadership .
observers say the move is an effort by the npd , which has traditionally rejected links to neo-nazis , of tapping into the scene to form a " people 's front from the right , " as voigt put it .
addressing the conference in this small eastern town which was heavily guarded by police , voigt said : " the time has come for a revolutionary change in germany , and this process started in saxony . "
ambitious plans greeted with skepticism political scientists , however , do n't believe the right-wing party can repeat its success on a national level .
they say the lack of a cohesive party program and media support would doom the party , as would the lack of finances .
under the alliance with the dvu , the two parties will enter a joint list of candidates for the national elections and will not stand against each other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.10.2004 switzerland 's famous saint bernards for sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tough times without tasso plans by the monks on switzerland 's saint bernard pass to sell their famous dogs has caused an uproar .
dog lovers say the pass just wouldn ’ t be the same without them - ven if they do n't tote brandy . the highest church in europe lies in the swiss mountains .
the handful of augustine monks who live here see it as an oasis of tranquillity , where travelers can seek shelter and spiritual solace .
but for hundreds of years , this hospice has also been home to a dozen saint bernard dogs .
traditionally used to rescue people trapped by avalanches , they now attract thousands of tourists each year .
father ivan kull said they ’ ve become too much for the monks , though .
" we think we ’ ve got enough to do , caring for people here , " said kull .
" we don ’ t want to look after the dogs anymore .
it takes up too much time and it ’ s costly . "
so the monks declared they would sell them and were stunned by the response .
" absurd ! "
father ivan said the hospice has been besieged for weeks .
" everyone wants to know what we ’ re doing by selling the dogs , " he said .
" i ’ ve had calls every two minutes from people wanting to adopt them ; there are television crews on our doorstep .
it ’ s absurd . "
the st. bernards , however , have already been moved to their winter quarters down in the valley below the church .
the plan is to sell them as a group for breeding .
the price is rumored to be $ 800,000 -lrb- € 630,000 -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the matterhorn in switzerland their handler bernard leger isn ’ t sure how long he ’ ll have a job .
he ’ s disappointed the monks want to sell .
" i love these dogs and i love my job , " said leger .
" they are big dogs , but very friendly , good with children , kind and gentle . "
contrary to popular belief , it 's actually been 50 years since a saint bernard rescued anyone lost in the snow .
at 80 kilograms -lrb- 175 pounds -rrb- , the breed is just too heavy for modern helicopters .
and that barrel of brandy around the dog ’ s neck is a myth .
no saint bernard ever carried one .
dogs = tourists the plans to sell the famous dogs puts more than just tradition at stake .
switzerland ’ s saint bernard region is not rich .
without thousands of tourists travelling up the pass to see the dogs , many locals believe their businesses will go under .
tourism director dominic fumeaux said the dogs must stay in the area .
" we are not prepared to let them go , " said fumeaux .
" it ’ s just too important .
we ’ ve got to find a solution even if we have to buy them ourselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the monks want to spend more time on the tourists and less on the dogs martine villetaz , who runs a hotel and gift shop on the road up to the pass , is already worrying .
she thinks the monks need to pay a bit more attention to the real world .
" the saint bernard is a symbol for everything swiss , " she said .
" it ’ s like the matterhorn and zermatt . "
according to villetaz , the region needs the st bernards .
" the monks can ’ t just think about religion , " she said .
" the dog is important for the economy and without it , i ’ m not sure we could survive . "
nothing to worry about the monks are surprised by the anger their plan 's have sarked among the locals .
father ivan said people are worrying unnecessarily .
" the saint bernards are not on the brink of extinction , " he said .
" there are plenty of them around the world and others in switzerland . "
the buyer would be required to bring the dogs up to the hospice every summer .
" so i don ’ t think there ’ s anything to worry about , " he said .
the hospice on the saint bernard pass is a thousand years old , and some things , like the daily calls to prayer , haven ’ t changed at all .
many hope the hospice ’ s most famous symbol won ’ t change either .
but that will depend on finding a buyer who can afford the dogs , who will keep them in the region , breed them , and take them up to the pass summer after summer . imogen foulkes -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bavarian haute couture goes to the dogs the owner of a shop selling traditional german clothing has put her talents in the service of man 's best friend , designing lederhosen and other typically bavarian garb for canines .

dog lovers say the pass just wouldn ’ t be the same without them - ven if they do n't tote brandy . the highest church in europe lies in the swiss mountains .
the handful of augustine monks who live here see it as an oasis of tranquillity , where travelers can seek shelter and spiritual solace .
but for hundreds of years , this hospice has also been home to a dozen saint bernard dogs .
traditionally used to rescue people trapped by avalanches , they now attract thousands of tourists each year .
father ivan kull said they ’ ve become too much for the monks , though .
" we think we ’ ve got enough to do , caring for people here , " said kull .
" we don ’ t want to look after the dogs anymore .
it takes up too much time and it ’ s costly . "
so the monks declared they would sell them and were stunned by the response .
" absurd ! "
father ivan said the hospice has been besieged for weeks .
" everyone wants to know what we ’ re doing by selling the dogs , " he said .
" i ’ ve had calls every two minutes from people wanting to adopt them ; there are television crews on our doorstep .
it ’ s absurd . "
the st. bernards , however , have already been moved to their winter quarters down in the valley below the church .
the plan is to sell them as a group for breeding .
the price is rumored to be $ 800,000 -lrb- € 630,000 -rrb- .

according to villetaz , the region needs the st bernards .
" the monks can ’ t just think about religion , " she said .

the buyer would be required to bring the dogs up to the hospice every summer .

the hospice on the saint bernard pass is a thousand years old , and some things , like the daily calls to prayer , haven ’ t changed at all .

traditionally used to rescue people trapped by avalanches , they now attract thousands of tourists each year .
father ivan kull said they ’ ve become too much for the monks , though .
" we think we ’ ve got enough to do , caring for people here , " said kull .
" we don ’ t want to look after the dogs anymore .
it takes up too much time and it ’ s costly . "
so the monks declared they would sell them and were stunned by the response .
" absurd ! "
father ivan said the hospice has been besieged for weeks .
" everyone wants to know what we ’ re doing by selling the dogs , " he said .
" i ’ ve had calls every two minutes from people wanting to adopt them ; there are television crews on our doorstep .
it ’ s absurd . "
the st. bernards , however , have already been moved to their winter quarters down in the valley below the church .
the plan is to sell them as a group for breeding .
the price is rumored to be $ 800,000 -lrb- € 630,000 -rrb- .

switzerland ’ s saint bernard region is not rich .
without thousands of tourists travelling up the pass to see the dogs , many locals believe their businesses will go under .
tourism director dominic fumeaux said the dogs must stay in the area .
" we are not prepared to let them go , " said fumeaux .
" it ’ s just too important .
we ’ ve got to find a solution even if we have to buy them ourselves . "

according to villetaz , the region needs the st bernards .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .
he said his party would also be prepared to work with the republikaner , another extreme-right party who have so far refused the offer of an alliance .
time for revolutionary change the npd shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern state of saxony last month , and is aiming to repeat that success on a national level in the 2006 parliamentary elections .
on saturday night , hardliners from the neo-nazi scene are expected to be voted into the national party leadership .
observers say the move is an effort by the npd , which has traditionally rejected links to neo-nazis , of tapping into the scene to form a " people 's front from the right , " as voigt put it .
addressing the conference in this small eastern town which was heavily guarded by police , voigt said : " the time has come for a revolutionary change in germany , and this process started in saxony . "
ambitious plans greeted with skepticism political scientists , however , do n't believe the right-wing party can repeat its success on a national level .
they say the lack of a cohesive party program and media support would doom the party , as would the lack of finances .
under the alliance with the dvu , the two parties will enter a joint list of candidates for the national elections and will not stand against each other .
only one extremist right-wing party has won seats in the bundestag lower house of parliament since world war ii and that was immediately after the war .
protesters fight police in protest against a neo-nazi march in potsdam on saturday , thousands of left-wing activists clashed with police officers .
the activists were there to protest the 350 neo-nazis who marched with police escort through downtown potsdam .
things quickly got out of hand and police had to beat back the anarchists with water cannons .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .
he said his party would also be prepared to work with the republikaner , another extreme-right party who have so far refused the offer of an alliance .
time for revolutionary change the npd shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern state of saxony last month , and is aiming to repeat that success on a national level in the 2006 parliamentary elections .
on saturday night , hardliners from the neo-nazi scene are expected to be voted into the national party leadership .
observers say the move is an effort by the npd , which has traditionally rejected links to neo-nazis , of tapping into the scene to form a " people 's front from the right , " as voigt put it .
addressing the conference in this small eastern town which was heavily guarded by police , voigt said : " the time has come for a revolutionary change in germany , and this process started in saxony . "
ambitious plans greeted with skepticism political scientists , however , do n't believe the right-wing party can repeat its success on a national level .
they say the lack of a cohesive party program and media support would doom the party , as would the lack of finances .
under the alliance with the dvu , the two parties will enter a joint list of candidates for the national elections and will not stand against each other .
only one extremist right-wing party has won seats in the bundestag lower house of parliament since world war ii and that was immediately after the war .
protesters fight police in protest against a neo-nazi march in potsdam on saturday , thousands of left-wing activists clashed with police officers .
the activists were there to protest the 350 neo-nazis who marched with police escort through downtown potsdam .
things quickly got out of hand and police had to beat back the anarchists with water cannons .
at least four officers were injured and several activists arrested . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt success of far-right alliance a combined far-right party made up of the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- and the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would stand little chance of success at the 2006 general election , say political experts .

speaking in front of 160 delegates , npd party chairman udo voigt said the alliance with the german people 's union -lrb- dvu -rrb- would make the parties , which are both strongly opposed to immigration , " a strong national entity " .
he said his party would also be prepared to work with the republikaner , another extreme-right party who have so far refused the offer of an alliance .
time for revolutionary change the npd shocked the mainstream political parties by winning 9.2 percent of the votes in a regional elections in the economically-depressed eastern state of saxony last month , and is aiming to repeat that success on a national level in the 2006 parliamentary elections .
on saturday night , hardliners from the neo-nazi scene are expected to be voted into the national party leadership .
observers say the move is an effort by the npd , which has traditionally rejected links to neo-nazis , of tapping into the scene to form a " people 's front from the right , " as voigt put it .
addressing the conference in this small eastern town which was heavily guarded by police , voigt said : " the time has come for a revolutionary change in germany , and this process started in saxony . "
ambitious plans greeted with skepticism political scientists , however , do n't believe the right-wing party can repeat its success on a national level .
they say the lack of a cohesive party program and media support would doom the party , as would the lack of finances .
under the alliance with the dvu , the two parties will enter a joint list of candidates for the national elections and will not stand against each other .
only one extremist right-wing party has won seats in the bundestag lower house of parliament since world war ii and that was immediately after the war .

those living within 100 metres of the cables are more likely to suffer from leukaemia , the study indicates .
the childhood cancer research group at oxford university studied 70,000 children under 15 for the department of health report , half of whom had cancer .
the seven-year study is reported in the times and the independent newspapers .
the research looked at the prevalence of high-voltage power cables near children 's homes .
' surprising ' results children born or living near the power lines were 1.7 times more likely to contract leukaemia than those in the control group , the research found .
some studies have already shown an association between some types of electromagnetic fields and increased childhood leukaemia .
research author dr gerald draper said other research suggested power lines might account for 20 to 30 of 500 cases of childhood leukaemia each year .
but , he said , his work indicated a far smaller number of cases were affected .
the findings were " surprising " and prompted further research , he added .
the department of health said it would not comment on the findings until dr draper submitted his final report .

the leader of the al-qaeda network says the reasons behind the events of 11 september 2001 still exist .
americans go to the polls in four days , but bin laden says their security depends on neither george w bush nor john kerry , but on us foreign policy .
the rivals both reacted angrily to the tape , and both vowed they would stand up to the threat posed by bin laden .
correspondents say that , in its simplest terms , this is a reminder from bin laden that he is still there and he is still a threat .
' another manhattan ' in the tape , bin laden speaks directly to the camera in a quiet , calm voice , making small gestures with his right hand .
he appears in good health .
" oh american people , " the video begins , " my talk to you is about the best way to avoid another manhattan ; about the war , its causes and results . "
he accuses president bush of deceiving the american people in the years since the 11 september attacks . "
your security does not lie in the hands of kerry , bush or al-qaeda .
your security is in your own hands " osama bin laden " bush is still deceiving you and hiding the truth from you , and therefore the reasons are still there to repeat what happened , " he says .
he also accuses mr bush of incompetence , saying the attacks on the us would have been less severe if the president had been more alert , and suggests mr bush abandoned his people in a time of crisis .
he ridicules the president for continuing to read a story to schoolchildren despite having just been informed of the attacks .
the video is bin laden 's clearest claim of responsibility yet for the attacks .
the al-qaeda leader likens the bush administration to arab regimes , saying both are characterised by " hubris , arrogance , greed and unlawful acquisition of money " .
he tries to appropriate the language of the bush administration , dismissing mr bush 's regular claims that al-qaeda militants " hate freedom " .
" we fought you because we are free and do not accept injustice , " he says .
he adds : " your security does not lie in the hands of kerry , bush , or al-qaeda .
your security is in your own hands .
each and every state that does not tamper with our security will have automatically assured its own security . "
bin laden also says he first thought of attacking the us after seeing destroyed tower blocks in lebanon following the israeli invasion in 1982 , which he says the us permitted . "
a blatantly obvious attempt to influence the us elections " robert , us us officials say they believe the tape is authentic .
the tape alludes to mr bush and mr kerry as presidential rivals - indicating that it must have been made in the last few months .
a spokesman for al-jazeera said the station received the tape early on friday , but would not indicate how .
french news agency afp quotes an unnamed us state department official as saying us diplomats in qatar had unsuccessfully attempted to prevent al-jazeera broadcasting the tape .
americans ' united ' the presidential rivals both responded quickly to the tape .
mr bush said : " let me make this very clear .
americans will not be intimidated or influenced by an enemy of our country .
i 'm sure senator kerry agrees with this . "
the american people were at war and would prevail , he said .
the bin laden tapes 29 oct : al-jazeera airs video of bin laden admitting he carried out 11 september attacks 15 april : bin laden audio tape gives europe three months to pull troops out of islamic nations 4 jan : al-jazeera airs audio tape calling on muslims to keep fighting holy war in middle east 10 sept 03 : video footage shows bin laden walking through rocky terrain with al-zawahri , two taped messages accompany video mr kerry , meanwhile , said americans were " absolutely united in our determination to hunt down and destroy osama bin laden and the terrorists " and he would " stop at absolutely nothing " to do so .
us officials have said there will be no change in the country 's terrorism alert status .
correspondents in washington say it is difficult to predict what impact this video will have on the us presidential contest , but it is likely to dominate the rest of the campaign .
this is the first new videotape of bin laden speaking to have surfaced since the us-led war in afghanistan .
however , several audio messages believed to be from him have emerged since then .
the most recent , posted on a website known to be used by islamist militants , strongly criticised the us and coalition forces in iraq and ordered a jihad , or holy war , against them .

he appears in good health .
" oh american people , " the video begins , " my talk to you is about the best way to avoid another manhattan ; about the war , its causes and results . "

the al-qaeda leader likens the bush administration to arab regimes , saying both are characterised by " hubris , arrogance , greed and unlawful acquisition of money " .
he tries to appropriate the language of the bush administration , dismissing mr bush 's regular claims that al-qaeda militants " hate freedom " .
" we fought you because we are free and do not accept injustice , " he says .
he adds : " your security does not lie in the hands of kerry , bush , or al-qaeda .
your security is in your own hands .

french news agency afp quotes an unnamed us state department official as saying us diplomats in qatar had unsuccessfully attempted to prevent al-jazeera broadcasting the tape .
americans ' united ' the presidential rivals both responded quickly to the tape .
mr bush said : " let me make this very clear .
americans will not be intimidated or influenced by an enemy of our country .

us officials have said there will be no change in the country 's terrorism alert status .
correspondents in washington say it is difficult to predict what impact this video will have on the us presidential contest , but it is likely to dominate the rest of the campaign .
this is the first new videotape of bin laden speaking to have surfaced since the us-led war in afghanistan .
however , several audio messages believed to be from him have emerged since then .

bath and north east somerset council wants to limit the number of loudspeakers " polluting " the city and could make buses install headphones .
old , dirty tour buses could also be banned under new legislation aimed at cutting the number of tours clogging up the historic city 's streets .
currently it is very easy to set up a tour bus using an old vehicle .
there are significant tax breaks in place which means operators only need a handful of passengers to break even .
old buses scrapped the council is preparing its case to put to the western area traffic commissioner which would allow it to impose the pollution controls .
the precise details will be subject to the commissioner 's approval , but the council is looking towards the new " euro iv " european standard .
that means only newer vehicles meeting these guidelines would be able to carry out tours , and some of the older ones could have their engines modified to comply .
those that could not be modified , would have to be sold or scrapped .
the proposed legislation means tour operators will have to make commercial decisions as to whether they continue in the market .
more headphones one tour operator told the bbc if legislation was introduced , then they would just " have to deal with it " .
a spokeswoman for first bus , who run commuter and tour services in the city said the company welcomed the changes .

bath and north east somerset council wants to limit the number of loudspeakers " polluting " the city and could make buses install headphones .
old , dirty tour buses could also be banned under new legislation aimed at cutting the number of tours clogging up the historic city 's streets .
currently it is very easy to set up a tour bus using an old vehicle .
there are significant tax breaks in place which means operators only need a handful of passengers to break even .
old buses scrapped the council is preparing its case to put to the western area traffic commissioner which would allow it to impose the pollution controls .
the precise details will be subject to the commissioner 's approval , but the council is looking towards the new " euro iv " european standard .
that means only newer vehicles meeting these guidelines would be able to carry out tours , and some of the older ones could have their engines modified to comply .
those that could not be modified , would have to be sold or scrapped .
the proposed legislation means tour operators will have to make commercial decisions as to whether they continue in the market .
more headphones one tour operator told the bbc if legislation was introduced , then they would just " have to deal with it " .
a spokeswoman for first bus , who run commuter and tour services in the city said the company welcomed the changes .
" we are aware of the limitations of older vehicles in our fleet but have a rolling plan to replace the buses .
