in germany , homeschooling is even illegal .
but around 200 parents here do it anyway . dorothee becker has lost all faith in the german school system .
none of her four children go to public or private schools .
the values that becker wants them to learn just are n't taken seriously in educational institutions , she says .
becker is also opposed to grades .
" the pressure is so enormous that it 's no longer important what the child can do , " she said . after eight years in the philippines , the becker family returned to germany , looking forward to the familiar environment and language and german schools .
but after six months of trying desperately to get used to their new classes , the children were exhausted .
it was difficult for them to integrate into the new class . " although the teachers took pains to help , the children experienced socialization in the school very negatively .
when , for example , our oldest did n't know a german word , everyone laughed and turned around and ran off , " becker explained . sick from school one after another , the children fell ill .
becker put it down to the pressure and frustration of school .
finally , she collected books and lessons plans and decided to take charge of the children 's education herself .
and the beckers informed the head of the school that their kids would no longer be attending classes .
" he said , ' i understand you , i wo n't make any problems for you ' , " becker recalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there was a problem .
whereas in other european countries , such as denmark and france , children are required merely to acquire a certain body of knowledge , in germany they must physically attend school .
the only exceptions are children who are ill and confined to a hospital for a long period or who hail from families who are part of a circus . a truancy officer notified the beckers that he would have the children picked up and escorted to school if needed .
" but my husband said , ' there are four children , so you need four policemen who will stay outside the four classroom doors ' , " becker explained . looking the other way becker and another estimated 200 families who have taken the radical step to homeschool their kids inhabit a legal gray area .
what they do is illegal , but the local authorities turn a blind eye - especially when they see that parents are devoted to teaching their children . although the becker kids , aged 11 to 18 , are homeschooled , they can still earn accepted school degrees .
two of them have already done so thanks to lots of hard work at home . experts say that kids who do n't go to school are n't socially-adjusted and lack assertiveness and the ability to deal with conflicts .
but , becker sees the positive aspects . " they have the freedom to learn , " she said .
" they do n't experience learning as something restrictive , as a constraint that you want to escape from as quickly as possible .

good scripts , quality performances , and a german public once again interested in home-grown movies has the film industry celebrating . to film buffs , they are household names - fassbinder , wenders , lang , herzog , wilder .
they represent the apex of german filmmaking , a high point that for years now , many felt was a thing of the past .
critics and audiences alike had steeled themselves against what was widely perceived as the long , painful decline of german film .
movies were made , of course , but few went to see them .
ignored at home , the international film community did n't pay them much attention either . but that seems to have changed and the german film industry is all smiles these days as it looks back on a very successful 2004 .
it was " one of the best years of the last decade , " johannes klingsporn , general manager of the german association of film distributors , told newsmagazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hmm ... which movie should i go see ?
while 2003 saw the industry chalking up losses , in the first nine months of 2004 , 12.7 percent more visitors went to the movies than they did the year before .
all in all in 2004 , movie theaters took in 10 percent more in box office receipts that they did the previous year . " as far as the economic situation goes , we seem to have finally made it out of the doldrums of the past few years , " peter dinges of the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- told der spiegel .
he added that 2004 was the second most successful year for german film since the fall of the berlin wall . germans watching german film while many of those tickets were sold for big hollywood blockbusters like " spider man 2 " or the latest harry potter adventure , german films have been pulling in audiences in numbers that they have n't seen in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " star trek " spoof " - " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " the most successful german film of 2004 was " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " -lrb- " dreamship surprise - period 1 " -rrb- .
this lampoon on the american 1960s-era " star trek " series featuring a well-known german comedian was seen by 9.2 million .
that was only surpassed by the third installment of the lord of the rings epic , " the return of the king . " in the first nine months of 2005 , according to ffa , 23.5 million germans went to see a german production .
that corresponds to a market share of 20.7 percent , the best results for german film in one year since the ffa began collecting data in 1995 . while it might seem strange to some that the german film industry is celebrating the fact that germans are watching german films , the tidal wave of films coming out of hollywood mean a german filmgoer is much more likely to watch a dubbed american blockbuster than a generally smaller german film . even though receipts from hollywood films still make up the lion 's share of german cinemas ' sales volume , germany played a bigger role this year than usual in several blockbusters out of tinseltown .
german directors wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich were at the helms of " troy " and " the day after tomorrow " respectively . varied subjects while abroad , german film has had the reputation of being serious and often difficult viewing , a new generation of german directors is exploring a wide palette of topics and timbres that have been impressing critics as well as attracting audiences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin makes a speech after his film " head on " won the best film award at the european film awards in barcelona , spain besides spirited farces like " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 , " directors are looking at contemporary issues in german society , such as the turkish immigrant community in " head on " -lrb- german title : " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which won the 2004 european film award -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the edukators " -lrb- german title : " die fetten jahre sind vorbei " -rrb- , an anti-globalization comedy in which young germans fight against societal inequalities , was accepted for the competition in cannes after an 11-year german absence . even topics such as nazi history are being tackled in new ways .
probably the most controversial and talked-about film of the year , " the downfall " -lrb- german title : " der untergang " -rrb- , looks at the final days of hitler 's third reich .
more than 4.2 million people went to see it . " this new generation of german filmmakers have found their own way of looking at german history as well as everyday life in ways that are both ingenious and entertaining , " ffa 's dinges said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu boosts home-grown filmmakers due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .
now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships .

good scripts , quality performances , and a german public once again interested in home-grown movies has the film industry celebrating . to film buffs , they are household names - fassbinder , wenders , lang , herzog , wilder .
they represent the apex of german filmmaking , a high point that for years now , many felt was a thing of the past .
critics and audiences alike had steeled themselves against what was widely perceived as the long , painful decline of german film .
movies were made , of course , but few went to see them .
ignored at home , the international film community did n't pay them much attention either . but that seems to have changed and the german film industry is all smiles these days as it looks back on a very successful 2004 .
it was " one of the best years of the last decade , " johannes klingsporn , general manager of the german association of film distributors , told newsmagazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hmm ... which movie should i go see ?
while 2003 saw the industry chalking up losses , in the first nine months of 2004 , 12.7 percent more visitors went to the movies than they did the year before .
all in all in 2004 , movie theaters took in 10 percent more in box office receipts that they did the previous year . " as far as the economic situation goes , we seem to have finally made it out of the doldrums of the past few years , " peter dinges of the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- told der spiegel .
he added that 2004 was the second most successful year for german film since the fall of the berlin wall . germans watching german film while many of those tickets were sold for big hollywood blockbusters like " spider man 2 " or the latest harry potter adventure , german films have been pulling in audiences in numbers that they have n't seen in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " star trek " spoof " - " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " the most successful german film of 2004 was " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " -lrb- " dreamship surprise - period 1 " -rrb- .
this lampoon on the american 1960s-era " star trek " series featuring a well-known german comedian was seen by 9.2 million .
that was only surpassed by the third installment of the lord of the rings epic , " the return of the king . " in the first nine months of 2005 , according to ffa , 23.5 million germans went to see a german production .
that corresponds to a market share of 20.7 percent , the best results for german film in one year since the ffa began collecting data in 1995 . while it might seem strange to some that the german film industry is celebrating the fact that germans are watching german films , the tidal wave of films coming out of hollywood mean a german filmgoer is much more likely to watch a dubbed american blockbuster than a generally smaller german film . even though receipts from hollywood films still make up the lion 's share of german cinemas ' sales volume , germany played a bigger role this year than usual in several blockbusters out of tinseltown .
german directors wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich were at the helms of " troy " and " the day after tomorrow " respectively . varied subjects while abroad , german film has had the reputation of being serious and often difficult viewing , a new generation of german directors is exploring a wide palette of topics and timbres that have been impressing critics as well as attracting audiences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin makes a speech after his film " head on " won the best film award at the european film awards in barcelona , spain besides spirited farces like " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 , " directors are looking at contemporary issues in german society , such as the turkish immigrant community in " head on " -lrb- german title : " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which won the 2004 european film award -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the edukators " -lrb- german title : " die fetten jahre sind vorbei " -rrb- , an anti-globalization comedy in which young germans fight against societal inequalities , was accepted for the competition in cannes after an 11-year german absence . even topics such as nazi history are being tackled in new ways .
probably the most controversial and talked-about film of the year , " the downfall " -lrb- german title : " der untergang " -rrb- , looks at the final days of hitler 's third reich .
more than 4.2 million people went to see it . " this new generation of german filmmakers have found their own way of looking at german history as well as everyday life in ways that are both ingenious and entertaining , " ffa 's dinges said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu boosts home-grown filmmakers due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .
now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships .

officials say failure to reach a deal could endanger the eu project . the european union 's incoming chairman this week called on the bloc 's richest members to back down on calls for a long-term spending freeze if they want a budget deal by next june .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker also said reforms expected under his six-month presidency to the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro , would make the the pact " more intelligent . " agreement on the 2007-2013 spending round is imperative by the end of luxembourg 's turn in the eu presidency in june if the bloc wants to proceed with its long-term plans , juncker said . " if we do n't arrive at an accord on the outlines by june 2005 , it will be impossible to enact the programs which should be available on january 1 , 2007 , " he told a news conference detailing his plans for the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker juncker said time was needed between next june and the start of 2007 to enact legislation for ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members .
luxembourg plans to begin budget negotiations on jan .
31 at a meeting of eu foreign ministers , according to foreign minister jean asselborn . spending caps the six biggest net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but the eu 's executive commission wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni , arguing that the bloc needs to put its money where its mouth is if it wants to achieve its long-term goals . " i believe there is no possibility of having a unanimous agreement based on the proposal for a cap at 1.0 percent , " juncker said .
" i think that the compromise to be found will lie between the proposal of the six countries and the proposals of the commission .
we have six months to resolve this problem , " he said . if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next eu presidency under britain will be unable to agree the spending round in time given london 's fierce defense of its own financial interests in the bloc . european commission chief jose barroso urged the bloc 's members to clinch a deal during the next six months .
otherwise , he warned , key eu objectives and policies could be in danger . stability pact reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker , left , talks to german finance minister hans eichel in brussels another economic debate that will come to a head under juncker 's presidency is reform of the stability pact , which was left in tatters by the eu 's failure to punish france and germany for repeatedly breaching its deficit rule . infamously dubbed once by former european commission chief romano prodi as " stupid , " the pact will become more supple to deal with countries battling to fix their finances in a downturn , juncker said . " the pact is not stupid , but it will be rendered more intelligent , " he said after holding talks with his belgian counterpart , guy verhofstadt . " that means that its preventive aspects will be reinforced , " juncker said , pointing to expected reforms that will require euro-zone countries to work harder on bringing down their deficits when economic times are good . reforms to the pact are expected to be adopted at an eu summit in march chaired by juncker , who from jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2005 berlin film festival set for scandal eu boosts home-grown filmmakers the best of germany 's silver screen berlinale joins european big three culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.12.2004 a bumper year for german film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film is popular again , and not just due to scenes like this after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .
good scripts , quality performances , and a german public once again interested in home-grown movies has the film industry celebrating . to film buffs , they are household names - fassbinder , wenders , lang , herzog , wilder .
they represent the apex of german filmmaking , a high point that for years now , many felt was a thing of the past .
critics and audiences alike had steeled themselves against what was widely perceived as the long , painful decline of german film .
movies were made , of course , but few went to see them .
ignored at home , the international film community did n't pay them much attention either . but that seems to have changed and the german film industry is all smiles these days as it looks back on a very successful 2004 .
it was " one of the best years of the last decade , " johannes klingsporn , general manager of the german association of film distributors , told newsmagazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hmm ... which movie should i go see ?
while 2003 saw the industry chalking up losses , in the first nine months of 2004 , 12.7 percent more visitors went to the movies than they did the year before .
all in all in 2004 , movie theaters took in 10 percent more in box office receipts that they did the previous year . " as far as the economic situation goes , we seem to have finally made it out of the doldrums of the past few years , " peter dinges of the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- told der spiegel .
he added that 2004 was the second most successful year for german film since the fall of the berlin wall . germans watching german film while many of those tickets were sold for big hollywood blockbusters like " spider man 2 " or the latest harry potter adventure , german films have been pulling in audiences in numbers that they have n't seen in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " star trek " spoof " - " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " the most successful german film of 2004 was " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " -lrb- " dreamship surprise - period 1 " -rrb- .
this lampoon on the american 1960s-era " star trek " series featuring a well-known german comedian was seen by 9.2 million .
that was only surpassed by the third installment of the lord of the rings epic , " the return of the king . " in the first nine months of 2005 , according to ffa , 23.5 million germans went to see a german production .
that corresponds to a market share of 20.7 percent , the best results for german film in one year since the ffa began collecting data in 1995 . while it might seem strange to some that the german film industry is celebrating the fact that germans are watching german films , the tidal wave of films coming out of hollywood mean a german filmgoer is much more likely to watch a dubbed american blockbuster than a generally smaller german film . even though receipts from hollywood films still make up the lion 's share of german cinemas ' sales volume , germany played a bigger role this year than usual in several blockbusters out of tinseltown .

probably the most controversial and talked-about film of the year , " the downfall " -lrb- german title : " der untergang " -rrb- , looks at the final days of hitler 's third reich .
more than 4.2 million people went to see it . " this new generation of german filmmakers have found their own way of looking at german history as well as everyday life in ways that are both ingenious and entertaining , " ffa 's dinges said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu boosts home-grown filmmakers due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .

officials say failure to reach a deal could endanger the eu project . the european union 's incoming chairman this week called on the bloc 's richest members to back down on calls for a long-term spending freeze if they want a budget deal by next june .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker also said reforms expected under his six-month presidency to the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro , would make the the pact " more intelligent . " agreement on the 2007-2013 spending round is imperative by the end of luxembourg 's turn in the eu presidency in june if the bloc wants to proceed with its long-term plans , juncker said . " if we do n't arrive at an accord on the outlines by june 2005 , it will be impossible to enact the programs which should be available on january 1 , 2007 , " he told a news conference detailing his plans for the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker juncker said time was needed between next june and the start of 2007 to enact legislation for ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members .
luxembourg plans to begin budget negotiations on jan .
31 at a meeting of eu foreign ministers , according to foreign minister jean asselborn . spending caps the six biggest net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but the eu 's executive commission wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni , arguing that the bloc needs to put its money where its mouth is if it wants to achieve its long-term goals . " i believe there is no possibility of having a unanimous agreement based on the proposal for a cap at 1.0 percent , " juncker said .
" i think that the compromise to be found will lie between the proposal of the six countries and the proposals of the commission .
we have six months to resolve this problem , " he said . if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next eu presidency under britain will be unable to agree the spending round in time given london 's fierce defense of its own financial interests in the bloc . european commission chief jose barroso urged the bloc 's members to clinch a deal during the next six months .
otherwise , he warned , key eu objectives and policies could be in danger . stability pact reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker , left , talks to german finance minister hans eichel in brussels another economic debate that will come to a head under juncker 's presidency is reform of the stability pact , which was left in tatters by the eu 's failure to punish france and germany for repeatedly breaching its deficit rule . infamously dubbed once by former european commission chief romano prodi as " stupid , " the pact will become more supple to deal with countries battling to fix their finances in a downturn , juncker said . " the pact is not stupid , but it will be rendered more intelligent , " he said after holding talks with his belgian counterpart , guy verhofstadt . " that means that its preventive aspects will be reinforced , " juncker said , pointing to expected reforms that will require euro-zone countries to work harder on bringing down their deficits when economic times are good . reforms to the pact are expected to be adopted at an eu summit in march chaired by juncker , who from jan .

officials say failure to reach a deal could endanger the eu project . the european union 's incoming chairman this week called on the bloc 's richest members to back down on calls for a long-term spending freeze if they want a budget deal by next june .
luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker also said reforms expected under his six-month presidency to the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro , would make the the pact " more intelligent . " agreement on the 2007-2013 spending round is imperative by the end of luxembourg 's turn in the eu presidency in june if the bloc wants to proceed with its long-term plans , juncker said . " if we do n't arrive at an accord on the outlines by june 2005 , it will be impossible to enact the programs which should be available on january 1 , 2007 , " he told a news conference detailing his plans for the next six months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker juncker said time was needed between next june and the start of 2007 to enact legislation for ambitious infrastructure projects and subsidies for the bloc 's newest and relatively poorer members .
luxembourg plans to begin budget negotiations on jan .
31 at a meeting of eu foreign ministers , according to foreign minister jean asselborn . spending caps the six biggest net contributors to the eu budget - austria , britain , france , germany , the netherlands and sweden - have called for the 2007-2013 budget to absorb no more than 1.0 percent of the eu 's gross national income -lrb- gni -rrb- . but the eu 's executive commission wants the level raised to 1.14 percent of gni , arguing that the bloc needs to put its money where its mouth is if it wants to achieve its long-term goals . " i believe there is no possibility of having a unanimous agreement based on the proposal for a cap at 1.0 percent , " juncker said .
" i think that the compromise to be found will lie between the proposal of the six countries and the proposals of the commission .
we have six months to resolve this problem , " he said . if there is no deal by june , many fear that the next eu presidency under britain will be unable to agree the spending round in time given london 's fierce defense of its own financial interests in the bloc . european commission chief jose barroso urged the bloc 's members to clinch a deal during the next six months .
otherwise , he warned , key eu objectives and policies could be in danger . stability pact reform bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude juncker , left , talks to german finance minister hans eichel in brussels another economic debate that will come to a head under juncker 's presidency is reform of the stability pact , which was left in tatters by the eu 's failure to punish france and germany for repeatedly breaching its deficit rule . infamously dubbed once by former european commission chief romano prodi as " stupid , " the pact will become more supple to deal with countries battling to fix their finances in a downturn , juncker said .

good scripts , quality performances , and a german public once again interested in home-grown movies has the film industry celebrating . to film buffs , they are household names - fassbinder , wenders , lang , herzog , wilder .
they represent the apex of german filmmaking , a high point that for years now , many felt was a thing of the past .
critics and audiences alike had steeled themselves against what was widely perceived as the long , painful decline of german film .
movies were made , of course , but few went to see them .
ignored at home , the international film community did n't pay them much attention either . but that seems to have changed and the german film industry is all smiles these days as it looks back on a very successful 2004 .
it was " one of the best years of the last decade , " johannes klingsporn , general manager of the german association of film distributors , told newsmagazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hmm ... which movie should i go see ?
while 2003 saw the industry chalking up losses , in the first nine months of 2004 , 12.7 percent more visitors went to the movies than they did the year before .
all in all in 2004 , movie theaters took in 10 percent more in box office receipts that they did the previous year . " as far as the economic situation goes , we seem to have finally made it out of the doldrums of the past few years , " peter dinges of the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- told der spiegel .
he added that 2004 was the second most successful year for german film since the fall of the berlin wall . germans watching german film while many of those tickets were sold for big hollywood blockbusters like " spider man 2 " or the latest harry potter adventure , german films have been pulling in audiences in numbers that they have n't seen in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " star trek " spoof " - " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " the most successful german film of 2004 was " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " -lrb- " dreamship surprise - period 1 " -rrb- .
this lampoon on the american 1960s-era " star trek " series featuring a well-known german comedian was seen by 9.2 million .
that was only surpassed by the third installment of the lord of the rings epic , " the return of the king . " in the first nine months of 2005 , according to ffa , 23.5 million germans went to see a german production .
that corresponds to a market share of 20.7 percent , the best results for german film in one year since the ffa began collecting data in 1995 . while it might seem strange to some that the german film industry is celebrating the fact that germans are watching german films , the tidal wave of films coming out of hollywood mean a german filmgoer is much more likely to watch a dubbed american blockbuster than a generally smaller german film . even though receipts from hollywood films still make up the lion 's share of german cinemas ' sales volume , germany played a bigger role this year than usual in several blockbusters out of tinseltown .
german directors wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich were at the helms of " troy " and " the day after tomorrow " respectively . varied subjects while abroad , german film has had the reputation of being serious and often difficult viewing , a new generation of german directors is exploring a wide palette of topics and timbres that have been impressing critics as well as attracting audiences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin makes a speech after his film " head on " won the best film award at the european film awards in barcelona , spain besides spirited farces like " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 , " directors are looking at contemporary issues in german society , such as the turkish immigrant community in " head on " -lrb- german title : " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which won the 2004 european film award -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the edukators " -lrb- german title : " die fetten jahre sind vorbei " -rrb- , an anti-globalization comedy in which young germans fight against societal inequalities , was accepted for the competition in cannes after an 11-year german absence . even topics such as nazi history are being tackled in new ways .
probably the most controversial and talked-about film of the year , " the downfall " -lrb- german title : " der untergang " -rrb- , looks at the final days of hitler 's third reich .
more than 4.2 million people went to see it . " this new generation of german filmmakers have found their own way of looking at german history as well as everyday life in ways that are both ingenious and entertaining , " ffa 's dinges said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu boosts home-grown filmmakers due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .

in germany , homeschooling is even illegal .
but around 200 parents here do it anyway . dorothee becker has lost all faith in the german school system .
none of her four children go to public or private schools .
the values that becker wants them to learn just are n't taken seriously in educational institutions , she says .
becker is also opposed to grades .
" the pressure is so enormous that it 's no longer important what the child can do , " she said . after eight years in the philippines , the becker family returned to germany , looking forward to the familiar environment and language and german schools .
but after six months of trying desperately to get used to their new classes , the children were exhausted .
it was difficult for them to integrate into the new class . " although the teachers took pains to help , the children experienced socialization in the school very negatively .
when , for example , our oldest did n't know a german word , everyone laughed and turned around and ran off , " becker explained . sick from school one after another , the children fell ill .
becker put it down to the pressure and frustration of school .
finally , she collected books and lessons plans and decided to take charge of the children 's education herself .
and the beckers informed the head of the school that their kids would no longer be attending classes .
" he said , ' i understand you , i wo n't make any problems for you ' , " becker recalled . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but there was a problem .
whereas in other european countries , such as denmark and france , children are required merely to acquire a certain body of knowledge , in germany they must physically attend school .
the only exceptions are children who are ill and confined to a hospital for a long period or who hail from families who are part of a circus . a truancy officer notified the beckers that he would have the children picked up and escorted to school if needed .
" but my husband said , ' there are four children , so you need four policemen who will stay outside the four classroom doors ' , " becker explained . looking the other way becker and another estimated 200 families who have taken the radical step to homeschool their kids inhabit a legal gray area .
what they do is illegal , but the local authorities turn a blind eye - especially when they see that parents are devoted to teaching their children . although the becker kids , aged 11 to 18 , are homeschooled , they can still earn accepted school degrees .
two of them have already done so thanks to lots of hard work at home . experts say that kids who do n't go to school are n't socially-adjusted and lack assertiveness and the ability to deal with conflicts .
but , becker sees the positive aspects . " they have the freedom to learn , " she said .
" they do n't experience learning as something restrictive , as a constraint that you want to escape from as quickly as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2005 berlin film festival set for scandal eu boosts home-grown filmmakers the best of germany 's silver screen berlinale joins european big three culture & lifestyle -pipe- 25.12.2004 a bumper year for german film großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german film is popular again , and not just due to scenes like this after years of decline , german film appears to have made a comeback in 2004 .
good scripts , quality performances , and a german public once again interested in home-grown movies has the film industry celebrating . to film buffs , they are household names - fassbinder , wenders , lang , herzog , wilder .
they represent the apex of german filmmaking , a high point that for years now , many felt was a thing of the past .
critics and audiences alike had steeled themselves against what was widely perceived as the long , painful decline of german film .
movies were made , of course , but few went to see them .
ignored at home , the international film community did n't pay them much attention either . but that seems to have changed and the german film industry is all smiles these days as it looks back on a very successful 2004 .
it was " one of the best years of the last decade , " johannes klingsporn , general manager of the german association of film distributors , told newsmagazine der spiegel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hmm ... which movie should i go see ?
while 2003 saw the industry chalking up losses , in the first nine months of 2004 , 12.7 percent more visitors went to the movies than they did the year before .
all in all in 2004 , movie theaters took in 10 percent more in box office receipts that they did the previous year . " as far as the economic situation goes , we seem to have finally made it out of the doldrums of the past few years , " peter dinges of the german federal film board -lrb- ffa -rrb- told der spiegel .
he added that 2004 was the second most successful year for german film since the fall of the berlin wall . germans watching german film while many of those tickets were sold for big hollywood blockbusters like " spider man 2 " or the latest harry potter adventure , german films have been pulling in audiences in numbers that they have n't seen in a decade . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " star trek " spoof " - " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " the most successful german film of 2004 was " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 " -lrb- " dreamship surprise - period 1 " -rrb- .
this lampoon on the american 1960s-era " star trek " series featuring a well-known german comedian was seen by 9.2 million .
that was only surpassed by the third installment of the lord of the rings epic , " the return of the king . " in the first nine months of 2005 , according to ffa , 23.5 million germans went to see a german production .
that corresponds to a market share of 20.7 percent , the best results for german film in one year since the ffa began collecting data in 1995 . while it might seem strange to some that the german film industry is celebrating the fact that germans are watching german films , the tidal wave of films coming out of hollywood mean a german filmgoer is much more likely to watch a dubbed american blockbuster than a generally smaller german film . even though receipts from hollywood films still make up the lion 's share of german cinemas ' sales volume , germany played a bigger role this year than usual in several blockbusters out of tinseltown .
german directors wolfgang petersen and roland emmerich were at the helms of " troy " and " the day after tomorrow " respectively . varied subjects while abroad , german film has had the reputation of being serious and often difficult viewing , a new generation of german directors is exploring a wide palette of topics and timbres that have been impressing critics as well as attracting audiences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin makes a speech after his film " head on " won the best film award at the european film awards in barcelona , spain besides spirited farces like " -lrb- t -rrb- raumschiff surprise - periode 1 , " directors are looking at contemporary issues in german society , such as the turkish immigrant community in " head on " -lrb- german title : " gegen die wand " -rrb- , which won the 2004 european film award -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the edukators " -lrb- german title : " die fetten jahre sind vorbei " -rrb- , an anti-globalization comedy in which young germans fight against societal inequalities , was accepted for the competition in cannes after an 11-year german absence . even topics such as nazi history are being tackled in new ways .
probably the most controversial and talked-about film of the year , " the downfall " -lrb- german title : " der untergang " -rrb- , looks at the final days of hitler 's third reich .
more than 4.2 million people went to see it . " this new generation of german filmmakers have found their own way of looking at german history as well as everyday life in ways that are both ingenious and entertaining , " ffa 's dinges said . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu boosts home-grown filmmakers due to an eu initiative that promotes films abroad , european films are increasingly popular .
now experts are debating whether filmmakers should define themselves in contrast to hollywood or seek beneficial partnerships .

heavy rain meant alain robert took four hours to climb the 508m -lrb- 1,667-foot -rrb- tower , almost double his estimate .
mr robert , 42 , has previously scaled the eiffel tower and around 30 of the world 's tallest buildings .
taipei 101 , due to open on new year 's eve , is 56m taller than kuala lumpur 's petronas tower , the previous highest .
light rain and strong winds hampered mr robert 's ascent , which was part of a series of events to mark the opening of the tower .
using a safety belt secured to a rope , he hauled himself up the tower - named because it is 101 storeys high - 10 floors at a time , resting between each ascent .
eight floors from the top mr robert stopped and chatted with the president of the tower .
arrest after beginning his ascent at 1000 local time -lrb- 0200 gmt -rrb- , he reached the top at around 1400 -lrb- 0600 gmt -rrb- .
mr robert climbed onto the top , which was partly shrouded in cloud and lashed by wind and rain , and waved to supporters and crowds at the bottom of the tower .
mr robert 's previous conquests include a host of the world 's most famous buildings .
he climbed new york 's empire state building in 1994 and the petronas towers in 1997 .
he has also scaled the sydney opera house , chicago 's sears tower , the montparnasse tower in paris and a host of others .
while many of his climbs are officially sanctioned , he has faced arrest in the past for climbing without permission , including an anti-war protest at the top of the eiffel tower in 2003 .
taipei 101 , which will open to the public and business early in 2005 , has been built at a cost of $ 1.8 billion -lrb- £ 1bn -rrb- .
as well as claiming the world record for tallest building , it also has two of the world 's fastest elevators .
they travel 1,010m per minute and can go from the ground floor to the 89th floor in 39 seconds .

so much so that , nearly 30 years after his death , he remains one of hollywood 's most intriguing and perplexing figures .
born on christmas eve 1905 in houston , texas , howard robard hughes jr became a millionaire at 18 when he inherited his late father 's hugely profitable machine tool company .
but the young hughes had no interest in drill-bit manufacturing , taking his fortune to california and setting himself up as a movie producer .
his first successful feature , 1927 's two arabian knights , won its director , lewis milestone , an oscar .
but it was his own debut as a director , 1930 's hell 's angels , that made his name .
hughes ' relationship with katharine hepburn was the talk of hollywood the first world war aerial drama took three years to make and , at $ 3.8m -lrb- £ 1.7m -rrb- , became the most expensive picture of its time .
too pricey to break even , it lost $ 1.5m -lrb- £ 775,000 -rrb- and cost three pilots their lives .
hughes nearly died himself when he crashed the stunt plane he was flying .
by this time , however , the aviation bug had taken hold .
in 1932 he formed the hughes aircraft company where he built and test-piloted the h-1 , the world 's most advanced plane .
in 1935 he set a new world speed record of 352 mph .
three years later he flew round the world in a record-breaking three days and 19 hours .
wooing in hollywood , however , he made headlines for different reasons .
his 1932 thriller scarface was released without censor approval , while the outlaw caused an outcry in 1943 with its provocative , sexually explicit content .
an overtly sexual jane russell caused an uproar in hughes ' the outlaw hughes and his aircraft engineers famously designed a special cantilevered bra for the film 's busty star , jane russell .
the then 20-year-old model was working as a receptionist for hughes ' dentist when he discovered her .
in return , she joined the growing list of hollywood beauties to be wooed and won by the dashing tycoon .
katharine hepburn , ava gardner and hell 's angels actress jean harlow all fell under his spell .
he was also rumoured to have romanced ginger rogers , bette davis and lana turner .
during the 1940s , however , hughes ' life began to spiral out of control .
his fear of germs and contamination led to increasingly erratic , obsessive-compulsive behaviour that his wealth allowed him to indulge .
moreover , his hopes of making hughes aircraft a major player in the industry took a knock when he was unable to deliver on two lucrative government contracts .
unpredictable in 1946 he suffered horrific injuries when he crashed the xf-11 , a reconnaissance plane of his own design , in beverly hills .
hughes was an obsessed genius when it came to planes and in 1947 , the h-4 hercules - a gigantic flying boat that came to be dubbed the spruce goose - was mothballed after just one maiden flight .
hughes fared no better in hollywood , gaining controlling interest of rko only to run the legendary studio into the ground with his eccentric , absentee management .
indeed , while he had periods of lucidity in the next few decades , he would eventually cut himself off completely from the outside world .
in 1966 he moved into the desert inn hotel in las vegas , taking up residence in the penthouse suite and ultimately buying the establishment to avoid being evicted .
demise there he ran a vast empire that encompassed casinos , hotels , tv stations and the twa airline .
albert r broccoli , a personal friend , used him as the basis for the willard whyte character in the 1971 bond film diamonds are forever .
jean harlow was just one of many stars who fell for hughes before his decline the final years of hughes ' life make grim reading .
addicted to valium and codeine , he locked himself away in darkened rooms where he kept his urine in jars , used tissue boxes as shoes and let his nails grow to grotesque lengths .
when he died in 1976 at the age of 70 , his appearance was so altered his fingerprints were used to confirm his identity .
x-rays showed fragments of hypodermic needles broken off in his arms , while his emaciated body was said to have resembled that of a japanese prisoner of war .

so much so that , nearly 30 years after his death , he remains one of hollywood 's most intriguing and perplexing figures .
born on christmas eve 1905 in houston , texas , howard robard hughes jr became a millionaire at 18 when he inherited his late father 's hugely profitable machine tool company .
but the young hughes had no interest in drill-bit manufacturing , taking his fortune to california and setting himself up as a movie producer .
his first successful feature , 1927 's two arabian knights , won its director , lewis milestone , an oscar .
but it was his own debut as a director , 1930 's hell 's angels , that made his name .
hughes ' relationship with katharine hepburn was the talk of hollywood the first world war aerial drama took three years to make and , at $ 3.8m -lrb- £ 1.7m -rrb- , became the most expensive picture of its time .
too pricey to break even , it lost $ 1.5m -lrb- £ 775,000 -rrb- and cost three pilots their lives .
hughes nearly died himself when he crashed the stunt plane he was flying .
by this time , however , the aviation bug had taken hold .
in 1932 he formed the hughes aircraft company where he built and test-piloted the h-1 , the world 's most advanced plane .
in 1935 he set a new world speed record of 352 mph .
three years later he flew round the world in a record-breaking three days and 19 hours .
wooing in hollywood , however , he made headlines for different reasons .
his 1932 thriller scarface was released without censor approval , while the outlaw caused an outcry in 1943 with its provocative , sexually explicit content .
an overtly sexual jane russell caused an uproar in hughes ' the outlaw hughes and his aircraft engineers famously designed a special cantilevered bra for the film 's busty star , jane russell .
the then 20-year-old model was working as a receptionist for hughes ' dentist when he discovered her .
in return , she joined the growing list of hollywood beauties to be wooed and won by the dashing tycoon .
katharine hepburn , ava gardner and hell 's angels actress jean harlow all fell under his spell .
he was also rumoured to have romanced ginger rogers , bette davis and lana turner .
during the 1940s , however , hughes ' life began to spiral out of control .
his fear of germs and contamination led to increasingly erratic , obsessive-compulsive behaviour that his wealth allowed him to indulge .
moreover , his hopes of making hughes aircraft a major player in the industry took a knock when he was unable to deliver on two lucrative government contracts .
unpredictable in 1946 he suffered horrific injuries when he crashed the xf-11 , a reconnaissance plane of his own design , in beverly hills .
hughes was an obsessed genius when it came to planes and in 1947 , the h-4 hercules - a gigantic flying boat that came to be dubbed the spruce goose - was mothballed after just one maiden flight .
hughes fared no better in hollywood , gaining controlling interest of rko only to run the legendary studio into the ground with his eccentric , absentee management .
indeed , while he had periods of lucidity in the next few decades , he would eventually cut himself off completely from the outside world .
in 1966 he moved into the desert inn hotel in las vegas , taking up residence in the penthouse suite and ultimately buying the establishment to avoid being evicted .
demise there he ran a vast empire that encompassed casinos , hotels , tv stations and the twa airline .
albert r broccoli , a personal friend , used him as the basis for the willard whyte character in the 1971 bond film diamonds are forever .
jean harlow was just one of many stars who fell for hughes before his decline the final years of hughes ' life make grim reading .
addicted to valium and codeine , he locked himself away in darkened rooms where he kept his urine in jars , used tissue boxes as shoes and let his nails grow to grotesque lengths .
when he died in 1976 at the age of 70 , his appearance was so altered his fingerprints were used to confirm his identity .
x-rays showed fragments of hypodermic needles broken off in his arms , while his emaciated body was said to have resembled that of a japanese prisoner of war .
it was a far cry from the larger-than-life legend who had taken hollywood , and america , by storm .

australia 's cate blanchett perfectly mimics hepburn 's distinctive voice blanchett 's mannered performance imbues the film with pace and a lightness of tone , echoing a golden era for hughes as he shatters flying records and defies hollywood censors .
it is the collapse of his relationship with hepburn , followed by a mesmerising air crash over beverly hills , that signals a turning point in hughes ' mental state , and in the screenplay .

a visual triumph , this generous portrait of hughes recounts the most prolific period in his life from the mid-1920s through the 1940s , when the millionaire challenged the boundaries of the motion picture industry and the future of flight .
chief among its delights is the brilliant digital technology used to recreate the two-strip and three-strip technicolor of hughes ' heyday .
not only is the result stunning , but it lends immediacy to an age of glamour and discovery .
after a salient opening sequence in which a young howard is warned of the festering consequences of germs , the action moves swiftly to the set of hell 's angels .
pop star gwen stefani plays starlet jean harlow in the biopic as its budget spirals out of control , scorsese spectacularly recreates scenes from the $ 4m -lrb- £ 2m -rrb- movie , with hughes taking to the skies to film groundbreaking action sequences from the cockpit .
as the young hughes , leonardo dicaprio ably captures his pioneering spirit and playboy lifestyle , while hinting at the dark obsessions that dogged hughes in later years .
hughes ' seduction of jean harlow -lrb- gwen stefani -rrb- and hells angels ' extravagant premiere , with its hungry hollywood press and dazzling flashbulb " pops " , beautifully conjure the womanising hughes and the lavish film world of the 1930s .
but it is the arrival of katharine hepburn - and a stand-out performance from cate blanchett - that lifts the film to a new level .
through hepburn 's eyes , and the couple 's shared eccentricities , emerges a more lucid and sympathetic hughes - a man dogged by contradictions , his need for privacy in sharp contrast to his entrepreneurial lust for adventure .
australia 's cate blanchett perfectly mimics hepburn 's distinctive voice blanchett 's mannered performance imbues the film with pace and a lightness of tone , echoing a golden era for hughes as he shatters flying records and defies hollywood censors .
it is the collapse of his relationship with hepburn , followed by a mesmerising air crash over beverly hills , that signals a turning point in hughes ' mental state , and in the screenplay .
hughes ' descent into paranoia and madness thrust the film into a darker dimension .
but while hughes ' growing panoply of phobias intrigues , the encroaching tragedy is curiously unmoving .
dicaprio is hampered by his baby-face , and no manner of tics , or bizarre behaviours elicit sympathy in what seems to be a very cinematic rendering of madness .
british actress kate beckinsale plays screen icon ava gardner perhaps it is the lack of human interaction that makes this third section drag .
elsewhere the film is sustained by strong performances and soaring action sequences .
yet , after the earlier technicolour glories - the resplendent hollywood gowns and sleek metal aeroplanes - hughes ' twilight retreat into solitude fails to engage .
only his spectacular showdown at the senate and a brief return to form at the helm of the grandiose spruce goose plane offer relief in what feels an increasingly laborious finale .
the aviator opens in london on 26 december 2004 , across the uk on 6 january 2005 and in the us on 25 december .

i would like to send a special message to all of you in the services spending christmas on active duty away from home .
very many of you listening today will be separated from your families this christmas which is hard for both you and those who are left at home .
it has been a very demanding year .
i am proud of the way that you have risen to the challenges with typical professionalism .
the varied tasks you take on in all parts of the world may be changing , but what remains the same is the spirit , good humour , courage and commitment you show every day , often in the most arduous conditions .
the conflict in iraq has dominated the headlines at home , but i am only too aware that whilst many of you have been deployed there , others have been working tirelessly in many other theatres .
whichever service you belong to , peace-keeping and humanitarian missions - helping to safeguard the innocent and offer them renewed hope for a better life - are as much a part of your duties today as combat operations , whether in the balkans , afghanistan , or elsewhere .
wherever you are , i would like to express my gratitude for your service this year , and i send each and every one of you my good wishes for christmas and the new year .

i am proud of the way that you have risen to the challenges with typical professionalism .
the varied tasks you take on in all parts of the world may be changing , but what remains the same is the spirit , good humour , courage and commitment you show every day , often in the most arduous conditions .
the conflict in iraq has dominated the headlines at home , but i am only too aware that whilst many of you have been deployed there , others have been working tirelessly in many other theatres .
whichever service you belong to , peace-keeping and humanitarian missions - helping to safeguard the innocent and offer them renewed hope for a better life - are as much a part of your duties today as combat operations , whether in the balkans , afghanistan , or elsewhere .
wherever you are , i would like to express my gratitude for your service this year , and i send each and every one of you my good wishes for christmas and the new year .
