schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .

they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2004 europe struggling to find organ donors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 12 percent of germans carry donor cards advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries . in germany alone , for example , roughly 12,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for new organs – many of whom will be forced to wait more than a year . some experts say hospitals themselves are to blame , others point the figure at the government .
but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2004 europe struggling to find organ donors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 12 percent of germans carry donor cards advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries . in germany alone , for example , roughly 12,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for new organs – many of whom will be forced to wait more than a year . some experts say hospitals themselves are to blame , others point the figure at the government .
but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2004 europe struggling to find organ donors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 12 percent of germans carry donor cards advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries . in germany alone , for example , roughly 12,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for new organs – many of whom will be forced to wait more than a year . some experts say hospitals themselves are to blame , others point the figure at the government .
but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

that 's because a majority of state premiers seem set on rejecting the lower saxonian premier 's call to throw out the german spelling reform and return to the old rules . several weeks ago , wulff had proposed to do so , saying that most germans had been confused by the new rules and were not accepting them .
he requested that he and his colleagues would discuss the matter at their next meeting on oct .
7 . but it looks like he might only get support from two other states : while the premiers of the western state of saarland and the eastern state of saxony-anhalt side with wulff , 13 other premiers oppose switching back to the old orthography , according to the magazine . as a result , premiers are likely to confirm august 2005 as the time when german students will be required to write according to the new rules .
so far , the old spelling has still been acceptable as well . the conference of german state education ministers meanwhile plans to announce a new " council on orthography " in september .
the group of experts is meant to monitor german spelling and adjust the rules accordingly . representatives from austria and switzerland , where the new rules have also been introduced , are expected to participate in the council as well . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis summit planned over spelling reform education policy chiefs want to hold a meeting in vienna in august in order to discuss a current debate over spelling and grammar reforms of the german language .

the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal .

but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2004 europe struggling to find organ donors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 12 percent of germans carry donor cards advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries . in germany alone , for example , roughly 12,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for new organs – many of whom will be forced to wait more than a year . some experts say hospitals themselves are to blame , others point the figure at the government .
but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2004 europe struggling to find organ donors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 12 percent of germans carry donor cards advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries . in germany alone , for example , roughly 12,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for new organs – many of whom will be forced to wait more than a year . some experts say hospitals themselves are to blame , others point the figure at the government .
but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.08.2004 schröder 's best " pr campaign " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud new parents the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .
schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .

that 's because a majority of state premiers seem set on rejecting the lower saxonian premier 's call to throw out the german spelling reform and return to the old rules . several weeks ago , wulff had proposed to do so , saying that most germans had been confused by the new rules and were not accepting them .
he requested that he and his colleagues would discuss the matter at their next meeting on oct .
7 . but it looks like he might only get support from two other states : while the premiers of the western state of saarland and the eastern state of saxony-anhalt side with wulff , 13 other premiers oppose switching back to the old orthography , according to the magazine . as a result , premiers are likely to confirm august 2005 as the time when german students will be required to write according to the new rules .
so far , the old spelling has still been acceptable as well . the conference of german state education ministers meanwhile plans to announce a new " council on orthography " in september .
the group of experts is meant to monitor german spelling and adjust the rules accordingly . representatives from austria and switzerland , where the new rules have also been introduced , are expected to participate in the council as well . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis summit planned over spelling reform education policy chiefs want to hold a meeting in vienna in august in order to discuss a current debate over spelling and grammar reforms of the german language .

the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2004 europe struggling to find organ donors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 12 percent of germans carry donor cards advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries . in germany alone , for example , roughly 12,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for new organs – many of whom will be forced to wait more than a year . some experts say hospitals themselves are to blame , others point the figure at the government .
but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .
but europe is moving to introduce a clamp down .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .
kiss-and-tell revelations hardly ever surface in the german media , not least because of the legal implications they may have . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .

that 's because a majority of state premiers seem set on rejecting the lower saxonian premier 's call to throw out the german spelling reform and return to the old rules . several weeks ago , wulff had proposed to do so , saying that most germans had been confused by the new rules and were not accepting them .
he requested that he and his colleagues would discuss the matter at their next meeting on oct .
7 . but it looks like he might only get support from two other states : while the premiers of the western state of saarland and the eastern state of saxony-anhalt side with wulff , 13 other premiers oppose switching back to the old orthography , according to the magazine . as a result , premiers are likely to confirm august 2005 as the time when german students will be required to write according to the new rules .
so far , the old spelling has still been acceptable as well . the conference of german state education ministers meanwhile plans to announce a new " council on orthography " in september .
the group of experts is meant to monitor german spelling and adjust the rules accordingly . representatives from austria and switzerland , where the new rules have also been introduced , are expected to participate in the council as well . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de crisis summit planned over spelling reform education policy chiefs want to hold a meeting in vienna in august in order to discuss a current debate over spelling and grammar reforms of the german language .
-lrb- aug .
9 , 2004 -rrb- major german media reject spelling reform rejecting a six-year-old spelling reform , several publishing companies have announced they would switch back to the old system .
the move comes shortly after leading conservative politicians had proposed a reversal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.08.2004 schröder 's best " pr campaign " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud new parents the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .
schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .
kiss-and-tell revelations hardly ever surface in the german media , not least because of the legal implications they may have . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new woman in schröder 's life gerhard schröder is no stranger to sharing his life with members of the opposite sex .

but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .

" nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2004 europe struggling to find organ donors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 12 percent of germans carry donor cards advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries . in germany alone , for example , roughly 12,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for new organs – many of whom will be forced to wait more than a year . some experts say hospitals themselves are to blame , others point the figure at the government .
but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2004 europe struggling to find organ donors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 12 percent of germans carry donor cards advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries . in germany alone , for example , roughly 12,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for new organs – many of whom will be forced to wait more than a year . some experts say hospitals themselves are to blame , others point the figure at the government .
but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.08.2004 europe struggling to find organ donors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only 12 percent of germans carry donor cards advertising campaigns aimed at dealing with the growing backlog of patients awaiting lifesaving organ transplant operations , are having little effect in some european countries . in germany alone , for example , roughly 12,000 people are stuck on waiting lists for new organs – many of whom will be forced to wait more than a year . some experts say hospitals themselves are to blame , others point the figure at the government .
but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .
on the other hand , the polish government is blessed with a much easier task in that nearly 90 percent of the population are all for donating their organs after death . this stems from the popularity of catholicism there : it ’ s the pope ’ s opinion that everybody should donate their organs after dying . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trading organs for money the illegal organ trade is flourishing , especially in eastern europe , where traders know that the promise of a few thousand dollars is too much to refuse .

but many people are simply not prepared to let their organs be removed after death . in france , about 250 people died last year because they missed out on receiving a new organ .
more than 10,000 french patients have been placed on waiting lists for a donated liver , kidney or heart . this is happening despite the fact that an organ can be legally removed from a dead person ’ s body for a transplantation in france if the person did not explicitly objected to this while still alive .
such legislation also exists in the czech republic , hungary , italy , portugal , spain , austria and belgium . liver donors especially needed patients in need of a new liver face the longest wait , according to jörg nevens from the leeuwen university hospital in belgium . “ there is an ever increasing number of jaundice patients , whose livers have been completely damaged by hepatitis c , " he told deutsche welle .
" that ’ s why we liver specialists are desperately in search of organ donors . " nevens added that the problem did n't exist 10 years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surgeons transplant a kidney at a hospital in the eastern german town of jena " we can take care of kidney patients with dialysis during the waiting time , " he said .
" but this isn ’ t possible though for liver patients .
if they don ’ t receive a new organ , they simply die . ” more donors are also needed in the united kingdom .
here , more than 7,000 patients are waiting for kidney transplantations .
however , only 1,400 operations can be performed each year . the british government ’ s been trying to introduce legislation similar to that in france and other country , making every person who dies a potential organ donor unless they have filled out an objection form . currently , relatives of the deceased can decide for them if the opposing documentation doesn ’ t exist .
this rule also applies in norway , sweden , denmark , finland , greece , the netherlands and germany . few donors in germany although 80 percent of germans are in favor of organ donating according to research , only about 12 percent hold a donor identification card .
this result is quite poor in comparison to the rest of europe . hospitals are also to blame for this , elisabeth pott , the director-general of the federal center for health education in cologne , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a patient is brought to the emergency room “ if well informed people are generally willing to donate their organs , but aren ’ t even approached because the hospital doesn ’ t take part in organ donating or because the hospital thinks it ’ s just too difficult , too complicated or too expensive to organize , this poses a major structural problem , ” she said . swedish success story it ’ s a different story in sweden , where the government has seen some success with its latest advertising campaign .
the radio , television and internet commercials encourage people to join the country ’ s register of organ donors , saying that it ’ s a matter of life and death . registrations have risen from around 8,000 to more than 100,000 within almost a year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.08.2004 schröder 's best " pr campaign " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : proud new parents the german chancellor 's decision to adopt a young child has unleashed massive media coverage .
schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image . " i hope that his decision to adopt a child has nothing to do with his political image , " said one woman . recent polls indicate that only a minority of germans see a link between politicians ’ private behavior and their public actions .

schröder 's been fighting revelations about his private life but the current attention could help rather than harm his career . german chancellor gerhard schröder and his wife doris earlier this week revealed that they had adopted a three-year-old child from an orphanage in st. petersburg in russia .
schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image .

schröder who ’ s fought the odd legal battle against the media over revelations about his private life is now being confronted with a new wave of coverage on his family life particularly in the tabloid press . but the tight-lipped german chancellor will surely have noticed this time around that the current coverage is largely improving his image in the population – an image which has been tainted in recent months by his harsh social reform drive . strict privacy laws germany has some of the world ’ s strictest privacy laws which also largely affect the way the media are allowed to deal with details from the lives of prominent public figures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not dyed , schröder insists in the middle of the 2002 general election campaign in germany , schröder took a news agency to court over their allegations that he ’ d dyed his hair , and he won the case .
the agency concerned described the ruling as a gagging order and an attack on media freedom . currently , germany ’ s mass circulation bild tabloid is bending over backwards to inform its readers about the schröders ’ move to adopt a little girl from russia .
the chancellor himself regards the matter as his private business and has said only so much . “ i can certainly confirm that we ’ ve adopted a child , " schröder said .
" but you ’ ll have to accept that i ’ m not at all willing to join a debate about the whys and what fors . ” popularity ratings up while not being on speaking terms with bild , schröder will have no intentions this time around to seek legal action : the side-effects of his child adoption are in fact very pleasant for him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for his 60th birthday earlier this year , bild published a mock front page on the back of the paper with good news stories about the chancellor he ’ s getting the best press coverage in months as attention is being distracted away from his unpopular agenda 2010 – a reform package geared to overhauling the country ’ s overburdened welfare system , but one accompanied by harsh social cuts . the rare media focus on the human side of the government leader is yielding first results .
schröder ’ s popularity ratings are rising from their historic lows , and with them those of his social democrats . little public interest ? unlike people in the anglo-saxon world , germans by tradition are relatively uninterested in gossip about politicians .
they did take notice of the child adoption , but most aren ’ t interested in any further details and believe that matter is the schröders ’ own , and only the schröders ’ business . " i 'm not so much interested , " said one man .
" i congratulate the schröders to the child . " another woman said it was the schröder 's private matter . " otherwise i think he 's a little bit old for a three-years old child , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most people here are giving no currency to some media people ’ s inkling that the schröders ’ move to adopt a child was a carefully timed measure to polish up the chancellor 's media image .

" i invite my countrymen to talk , even to my most bitter enemies i offer my hand , " said hugo chavez , whose populist policies have split venezuelan opinion .
mr chavez officially won 59 % of the vote , sparking allegations of vote-rigging from the opposition .
the country 's electoral authorities say preliminary results of an audit on the vote show there was no fraud .
the result has also been endorsed by international election monitors .
mr chavez said his opponents were " embarrassing themselves in front of the whole world " .
" these are absurd charges of a fraud that has not appeared anywhere and will not appear anywhere , " he said during a late-night broadcast .
allegations electoral authorities say more than 30 % of 150 randomly chosen polling sites have been checked so far - confirming the outcome of the vote there .
the outcome of the audit is expected to be published over the weekend .
the venezuelan opposition is crying foul it is being carried out by the official electoral authority - the venezuelan national electoral council - and international observers from the carter center and the organization of american states -lrb- oas -rrb- .
they are checking the results produced by voting machines in 150 polling stations against paper records , in the presence of government and opposition representatives .
the main opposition parties have refused to send representatives , saying the review would not properly investigate their allegations of massive fraud in the vote .
they are calling for checks to include touch-screen voting machines , saying many were rigged - allegations rejected by electoral officials .
tireless campaign announcing the audit on tuesday , former us president jimmy carter said he and the oas had suggested the move to allay fears over the validity of the outcome .
he stressed that he himself had " no reason to doubt the integrity of the electoral process or the accuracy of the referendum itself " .
the opposition has fought a tireless campaign to see mr chavez ousted .
the president survived a short-lived coup in april 2002 and a two-month strike that badly damaged the economy later that year .
the referendum was called after the opposition collected signatures from 20 % of the population - a recall mechanism inserted into the venezuelan constitution by mr chavez in 1999 .

they say some of scotland 's rarest species are under threat in an area where they should be protected .
scotland 's west coast is home to 24 types of whale , dolphin and porpoise .
basking sharks also visit these waters .
more than 50 field workers and conservationists will be combining their knowledge on saturday in an event on a royal navy boat .
as part of the new initiative , conservation bodies such as the rspb will team up with police .
they will aim to make existing patrols more effective by combining science and law enforcement .
police are also urging sailors to keep their distance from the mammals , which are protected by law , after reports that they have been disturbed .
code of conduct sergeant john simpson , wildlife crime officer with the ministry of defence police , said : " this event will tackle a number of long standing issues from lack of biological knowledge of marine fauna to identifying hotspots of wildlife and environmental crimes in and along the clyde coast .
" there have been many recent sightings of cetaceans and basking sharks along the inner clyde coast , kilcreggan , gourock and loch long but some significant problems are already being identified too .
" recreational sailors have been seen pursuing and disturbing cetaceans and sharks that have appeared in the clyde .
police are appealing to sailing clubs to follow the code of conduct when encountering these animals as it is illegal to disturb basking sharks in british waters " .
on west coast shorelines , rare birds such as the redshank are also under threat .
detectives say they are concerned by the number of birds illegally shot .

as part of the new initiative , conservation bodies such as the rspb will team up with police .
they will aim to make existing patrols more effective by combining science and law enforcement .
police are also urging sailors to keep their distance from the mammals , which are protected by law , after reports that they have been disturbed .
code of conduct sergeant john simpson , wildlife crime officer with the ministry of defence police , said : " this event will tackle a number of long standing issues from lack of biological knowledge of marine fauna to identifying hotspots of wildlife and environmental crimes in and along the clyde coast .
" there have been many recent sightings of cetaceans and basking sharks along the inner clyde coast , kilcreggan , gourock and loch long but some significant problems are already being identified too .
" recreational sailors have been seen pursuing and disturbing cetaceans and sharks that have appeared in the clyde .
police are appealing to sailing clubs to follow the code of conduct when encountering these animals as it is illegal to disturb basking sharks in british waters " .
on west coast shorelines , rare birds such as the redshank are also under threat .
detectives say they are concerned by the number of birds illegally shot .

thousands of the sweets will be handed out throughout august in an effort to reduce drunken violence after clubs close their doors .
it is hoped the lollipops will divert club-goers from shouting and arguing and invoke a sense of fun instead .
it is the first time the unconventional scheme has been trialled in wales .
" this initiative is something that people will find quite funny but it 's been tried and tested and it appears that it does have a positive effect on people 's demeanour , " said chief inspector bob wilson from north wales police .
" the idea behind this initiative is to divert people 's minds away from public disorder and reduce the potential for violence and anti-social behaviour , " he added .
anything that helps customers leave safely is a good thing nick barwell , scott 's nightclub manager the 22,000 lollipops have cost £ 500 to buy and have been paid for by the home office .
dominic gillespie , manager of liquid and envy nightclub in the town centre , said his door staff will be handing out lollipops to all their 1,600 clubbers .
" i think it 's an awesome idea .
it 's quite innovative and although there 's not a lot of noise coming out at two in the morning , this is going to reduce it even further , " he said .
mr gillespie said he expected his customers to welcome the free sweets .
" most of them will take it as a laugh i think but it has got a serious purpose because they wo n't be able to sing songs when they 've got lollipops in their mouths .
" some studies have shown that if you 've got your mind on something else , you 're not going to be doing something you should n't . "
nightclub manager nick barwell supports the scheme nick barwell , general manager at wrexham nightclub scott 's , said : " anything that helps customers leave safely is a good thing " .
" i think a lot of people will look at the lollipops and think they 're a little bit strange but anything that distracts them from getting involved in any trouble is a good thing from our point of view , " he added .
the scheme has already had a positive effect in parts of cleveland , leicester and devon .
