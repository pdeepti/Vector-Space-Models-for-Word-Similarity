the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .

" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "

by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .

but things are looking up . it was almost sacriligious .
fans crowding the stadiums for the 2006 world cup would be limited to only one brand of beer to wet their whistles - budweiser , the product of us brewery anheuser busch . the company had laid down $ 40 million -lrb- € 29.8 million -rrb- for the rights to be one of the world cup 's main sponsors , and in return , was given a monopoly on beer sales in the world cup stadiums . while budweiser might be a top seller stateside , in germany - renowned for the variety and purity of its brews - bud is looked down on with scornful disdain .
it 's watery and lacks any " kick , " say german connoisseurs .
for german soccer fans , things were looking grim . bitburger saves the day but politicians and breweries refused to accept defeat , and on tuesday , the head of marketing at german brewery bitburger emerged triumphant .
bitburger has signed an agreement with anheuser busch that will allow its brand of pilsner to be sold alongside budweiser . the ace up bitburger 's sleeve ?
years ago , the brewery had obtained a court ruling in its favor forbidding the advertising of budweiser in germany because there was a danger that german consumers would confuse " bit " with " bud . " what about the bratwurst ? for the sake of the world cup , however , both breweries have agreed to peacefully co-exist , leaving german soccer fans to grumble about an equally weighty problem - what exactly will they be washing down with their bits and buds ? will the traditional bratwurst be on the menu , or will they be forced to resort to american hamburgers ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.12.2004 -pipe- 13:00 utc bundesbank refuses to sell gold the bundesbank refused on monday to bow to pressure from the german government , which has been calling on the central bank to sell a large part of its gold reserves and use the proceeds to bring down germany 's soaring public deficit .
under a recently renewed gold agreement , signed with 14 other european central banks , the bundesbank can sell up to 120 tons of gold from its gold reserves each year for the next five years .
with total gold reserves of 3,400 tons , the german central bank is the world 's second-biggest holder of gold after the us federal reserve .
but the bundesbank announced on monday it would make only very limited use of that option and sell only eight ton of gold in 2004 .
the gold would be sold to the german finance ministry for use in its regular gold coin minting program .
the german government had been hoping the bundesbank would sell a more substantial volume of gold this year to help bring down the german public deficit .
however , the bundesbank is opposed to selling the gold for such purposes .
" the bundesbank 's gold reserves are part of our national wealth and have great symbolic value for the population , " central bank president axel weber said in an interview in the daily die welt on tuesday .
in addition , gold sales should not be seen as an alternative to long-term budgetary consolidation , weber said . dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?
now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country .

munich re holds just over 18 percent in hvb and just under 10 percent in allianz .
" for strategic reasons , we 're still very interested in hvb 's distribution network , but we do n't need a stake of that size for that , " von bomhard told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" it is our aim to reduce balance sheet risks .
we currently have too many bank risks , " the chairman said .
munich re had been approached by a number of potential buyers for the stake , he continued .
with regard to allianz , the munich re chairman said : " i do n't know how big a stake we 'll hold in a year 's time .
but i suppose it 'll be less than we hold now . "
munich re cut its stake in allianz from 12 percent at the beginning of the year to under 10 percent .
the two insurance giants have had close ties ever since they were set up , but decided last year to untangle their tight-knit web of cross-shareholdings .
turning to munich re 's earnings target for the current year , von bomhard said the group was still aiming for net profit of € 1.8-2.0 billion -lrb- $ 2.4-2.7 billion -rrb- .
" that range is still valid and we 're on the way " to achieving it , he said . dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled .

munich re holds just over 18 percent in hvb and just under 10 percent in allianz .
" for strategic reasons , we 're still very interested in hvb 's distribution network , but we do n't need a stake of that size for that , " von bomhard told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" it is our aim to reduce balance sheet risks .
we currently have too many bank risks , " the chairman said .
munich re had been approached by a number of potential buyers for the stake , he continued .
with regard to allianz , the munich re chairman said : " i do n't know how big a stake we 'll hold in a year 's time .
but i suppose it 'll be less than we hold now . "
munich re cut its stake in allianz from 12 percent at the beginning of the year to under 10 percent .
the two insurance giants have had close ties ever since they were set up , but decided last year to untangle their tight-knit web of cross-shareholdings .
turning to munich re 's earnings target for the current year , von bomhard said the group was still aiming for net profit of € 1.8-2.0 billion -lrb- $ 2.4-2.7 billion -rrb- .
" that range is still valid and we 're on the way " to achieving it , he said . dw-world.de bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .

munich re holds just over 18 percent in hvb and just under 10 percent in allianz .
" for strategic reasons , we 're still very interested in hvb 's distribution network , but we do n't need a stake of that size for that , " von bomhard told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .

with regard to allianz , the munich re chairman said : " i do n't know how big a stake we 'll hold in a year 's time .
but i suppose it 'll be less than we hold now . "
munich re cut its stake in allianz from 12 percent at the beginning of the year to under 10 percent .
the two insurance giants have had close ties ever since they were set up , but decided last year to untangle their tight-knit web of cross-shareholdings .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .

parents here are free to call their children " pumuckl " - which germans associate with a series of children 's movies and books about an imp of the same name - since it stems from nepomuk , an accepted german name .

" the girl 's name ' nagina , ' for example , comes from sanskrit , " he said .

"
villas and workshops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the 1920s , the town shipped toys , often handmade , to the rest of the world .
although history played its part in phasing out much of the business during the course of the century - this part of the country became east germany during world war ii - there are still a number of toy makers in the region , and the tradition lives on .
a stroll through the town shows the signs of the wealth the toy business brought : villas of former toy manufacturers , erstwhile trading establishments and workshops , town halls and schools .
there is also the german toy museum , the oldest in the country .
it attracts visitors to sonneberg from all over the world , with some 60,000 items in its collection , 6,000 exhibit pieces , and a unique library of toy history .
there you can read about how arduous a task it was to make the filigree toys from the early 19th century .
the top floor of the toy museum is dedicated to dolls .
competition blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the area around sonneberg , most families were in some way tied to the making of toys .
after the region became part of east germany , the businesses were nationalized .
today , the challenge for the remaining toy makers is to compete on the open market against toys made in low-wage countries .
while toys are important to a german christmas , so are christmas trees - and with the trees , the decorations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauscha also makes these plain red christmas ornaments the cradle of glass christmas tree decorations is the small thuringian city of lauscha .
in 1835 , a human glass eye was made in the town , adding to its international renown for glassmaking .
christmas ornaments in lauscha , the museum of glass art documents the origins of ornament making .
in the beginning , cotton batting was shaped into winter motifs , covered with decorative paper , and covered with clear paste and glittery glass dust .
today in lauscha , " weinachtsland , " or " christmas land , " is open year round .

the icing on the cake for schröder was putin 's announcement that russia is willing to pay back a considerable amount of the foreign debt it owes the 18 creditor nations of the paris club , including germany , ahead of the actual deadline . " russia is ready to solve this issue , " putin said after the talks in schleswig , northern germany on tuesday . observers at the meeting reported that germany could reckon with € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- in russian debt-servicing reimbursement annually from 2005 , but the details would still have to be sorted out with other members of the group . not germany 's concern ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yukos gas station in moscow apart from economic issues , schröder and putin also debated a number of foreign policy issues , but they largely avoided the controversial weekend sale of russian oil giant yukos ' largest production unit , yuganskneftegaz .

" in our talks , putin has left no doubt whatsoever that he 'll accept the outcome of the election re-run without any strings attached . " putin told the media in schleswig he was banking on german help to modernize russia 's domestic energy and transport sectors , lauding the agreement for german engineering giant siemens to deliver 60 high-speed trains to the russian railway as " a new example of our long-term strategic partnership in the economic field . "
held his tongue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops sit atop an apc while patrolling in grozny , chechnya in november .
without touching directly on the human rights situation in chechnya , putin did make clear he was willing to accept a special european dialogue forum as a mediating instrument in the ongoing conflict in the caucasus region .
german opposition leaders had criticized schröder for not buttonholing putin over human rights issues . but alexander rahr , a german expert on russia , backed the chancellor 's cautious approach , saying that putin can also look back on major achievements .
" there 's no denying that putin has stabilized the country in a considerable way and brought fresh impetus to german-russian relations , " rahr said , pointing to russia 's willingness to repay debt .
" berlin is delighted to see russia come to its rescue and help plug the huge holes in the federal budget . " faced with the prospect of such a financial windfall as they grapple with the effects of three years of economic stagnation , it was clear that schröder and his cabinet members would not make tricky human rights issues a priority . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

the icing on the cake for schröder was putin 's announcement that russia is willing to pay back a considerable amount of the foreign debt it owes the 18 creditor nations of the paris club , including germany , ahead of the actual deadline . " russia is ready to solve this issue , " putin said after the talks in schleswig , northern germany on tuesday . observers at the meeting reported that germany could reckon with € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- in russian debt-servicing reimbursement annually from 2005 , but the details would still have to be sorted out with other members of the group . not germany 's concern ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a yukos gas station in moscow apart from economic issues , schröder and putin also debated a number of foreign policy issues , but they largely avoided the controversial weekend sale of russian oil giant yukos ' largest production unit , yuganskneftegaz .
both described the issue as an internal russian problem . at the same time , german media reported that the german government had been putting pressure on energy concern e.on to expand its 6.5 percent stake in russian utility giant to help strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries . schröder and putin did , however , discuss the presidential election re-run in ukraine set for sunday at length , schröder said .

26 , " schröder said .
" in our talks , putin has left no doubt whatsoever that he 'll accept the outcome of the election re-run without any strings attached . " putin told the media in schleswig he was banking on german help to modernize russia 's domestic energy and transport sectors , lauding the agreement for german engineering giant siemens to deliver 60 high-speed trains to the russian railway as " a new example of our long-term strategic partnership in the economic field . "
held his tongue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops sit atop an apc while patrolling in grozny , chechnya in november .
without touching directly on the human rights situation in chechnya , putin did make clear he was willing to accept a special european dialogue forum as a mediating instrument in the ongoing conflict in the caucasus region .
german opposition leaders had criticized schröder for not buttonholing putin over human rights issues . but alexander rahr , a german expert on russia , backed the chancellor 's cautious approach , saying that putin can also look back on major achievements .
" there 's no denying that putin has stabilized the country in a considerable way and brought fresh impetus to german-russian relations , " rahr said , pointing to russia 's willingness to repay debt .
" berlin is delighted to see russia come to its rescue and help plug the huge holes in the federal budget . " faced with the prospect of such a financial windfall as they grapple with the effects of three years of economic stagnation , it was clear that schröder and his cabinet members would not make tricky human rights issues a priority . hardy graupner -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin says he 's ready to talk in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .

some of the works of art were handed to the austrian government .
at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .
when attorneys then filed suit on behalf of the survivors in a us district court in miami in 2001 , the government invoked a statute of limitations and state immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capitol hill pressured government to reach settlement a judge lifted the limitations before ordering the sides to negotiate .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .
that 's when troops intercepted the train in werfen , austria . booty for officers and personnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz according to government documents , some of the property was requisitioned by us military officers to furnish homes and offices , sold in army commissaries or kept by military personnel .
some of the works of art were handed to the austrian government .
at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .
when attorneys then filed suit on behalf of the survivors in a us district court in miami in 2001 , the government invoked a statute of limitations and state immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capitol hill pressured government to reach settlement a judge lifted the limitations before ordering the sides to negotiate .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .

however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .

under a recently renewed gold agreement , signed with 14 other european central banks , the bundesbank can sell up to 120 tons of gold from its gold reserves each year for the next five years .
with total gold reserves of 3,400 tons , the german central bank is the world 's second-biggest holder of gold after the us federal reserve .
but the bundesbank announced on monday it would make only very limited use of that option and sell only eight ton of gold in 2004 .
the gold would be sold to the german finance ministry for use in its regular gold coin minting program .
the german government had been hoping the bundesbank would sell a more substantial volume of gold this year to help bring down the german public deficit .
however , the bundesbank is opposed to selling the gold for such purposes .
" the bundesbank 's gold reserves are part of our national wealth and have great symbolic value for the population , " central bank president axel weber said in an interview in the daily die welt on tuesday .
in addition , gold sales should not be seen as an alternative to long-term budgetary consolidation , weber said . dw-world.de can gold sales stop germany 's brain drain ?
now that europe 's central banks have agreed on how much gold they can sell over the next five years , germany is considering using its profits to stop top researchers from leaving the country .

under a recently renewed gold agreement , signed with 14 other european central banks , the bundesbank can sell up to 120 tons of gold from its gold reserves each year for the next five years .
with total gold reserves of 3,400 tons , the german central bank is the world 's second-biggest holder of gold after the us federal reserve .
but the bundesbank announced on monday it would make only very limited use of that option and sell only eight ton of gold in 2004 .
the gold would be sold to the german finance ministry for use in its regular gold coin minting program .
the german government had been hoping the bundesbank would sell a more substantial volume of gold this year to help bring down the german public deficit .
however , the bundesbank is opposed to selling the gold for such purposes .

"
he said the suggestions had been scrutinized closely in moscow . " we sould like to adopt these suggestions wholeheartedly , " he said , although he did not go into the particulars .
german authorities also would not reveal the exact nature of the suggestions presented to russia . questions about ukraine putin also said he was ready to discuss " all the questions at issue " regarding the cancelled presidential elections in ukraine as well as press freedom and " internal reforms in russia . " although economic cooperation , eu ties and educational exchanges between the two countries figure high on the agenda , it ’ s the uncomfortable issues of the ukrainian presidential election in a week ’ s time and the dismantling of yukos that overshadow the bilateral talks . the re-run of the controversial ukraine election , which pitted the pro-western opposition candidate viktor yushchenko against the kremlin-backed prime minister viktor yanukovych , sent a decisive rift through ties between the european union and russia .
schröder , who enjoys a warm personal friendship with putin in addition to maintaining one of the closest working relationships to russia , has been put in a difficult position over the situation in ukraine . schröder 's ukrainian conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder on a train on tuesday the chancellor likes to see himself as a bridge between the european union and russia , but he has found that role hard to reconcile with putin ’ s support for yanukovych .
unlike other eu leaders , schröder refrained from loudly criticizing putin for endorsing the fraudulent vote which put yanukovych into the presidential seat . instead , schröder telephoned putin twice in the highly charged days following the nov .
21 ballot while russia raged over the west ’ s meddling in ukraine ’ s internal affairs . “ there is no doubt that schröder can raise issues with putin that other eu leaders can ’ t and his two calls to putin showed the respect between the two , ” alexander rahr , a russian specialist at the german council on foreign relations , told afp . minimizing the differences “ but at these talks schröder will not want to make the differences between the two noticeable , for many reasons , such as the energy alliance that europe wants to build with russia , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder is put in the hot seat during a dec .
1 parliamentary debate on the ukrainian election .
schröder will try to minimize the discussions about ukraine and the only public declaration will be one that both sides can support : endorsement for free and fair elections during the re-run on dec .
26 . energy policy another issue unlikely to be aired publicly is the german government ’ s stance on russia ’ s auctioning off of the crown jewel of stricken oil giant yukos on sunday .
during high-profile bidding , a mystery company that is widely believed to be a front for the state-run gas monopoly gazprom , snatched up yuganskneftegaz for $ 9.35 billion -lrb- € 7.02 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yukos ' profitable daughter company , yuganskneftegaz , pumps a milion barrels a day the purchase by the high bidder , a previously unknown baikalfinansgroup , represents a death blow for yukos , whose ambitious billionaire founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested in october 2003 on fraud and tax evasion charges .
if the baikal group turns out to be a front for gazprom , it would put a large slice of the russian energy industry back into government hands . just ahead of the auction , gazprom negotiated with a consortium of european banks headed by deutsche bank to secure a € 10-billion loan to buy yuganskneftegaz , an attempt many experts saw as an effort to renationalize the russian oil industry . “ in reality , this is an example of creeping nationalization of a private industry , ” said frank umbach , an expert for energy security at the körber-center russia . keeping the gas lines open the german government , although aware of the complaints , did not raise any objections to the attempts because , as a spokesman said , “ it involves private economic activity . ”
but by refusing to criticize gazprom ’ s bid , “ the chancellor endorses the politics of putin , ” umbach told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas lines pump natural gas directly from russia to germany is schröder afraid of alienating moscow and risking a change in the russian-german energy policy ?
nearly 40 percent of the country ’ s natural gas imports come from russia – germany is dependent on russia for its energy consumption . the head of the research group for russian studies at the institute for political science , roland götz , told deutsche welle there is no reason for schröder to feel he needs to placate putin . “ it ’ s a myth to think that german politics have to bend to russia , " he said .
" the economy between the two countries would continue to flourish even if the political relations are not so hearty . " however , it ’ s just as unlikely that schröder will raise the issue of energy policy as that of ukraine , said umbach and doubted that the chancellor will try to influence putin in any way . “ schröder is following an energy policy that has little to do with the economic and political interests of germany and the eu , " he said .

but things are looking up . it was almost sacriligious .
fans crowding the stadiums for the 2006 world cup would be limited to only one brand of beer to wet their whistles - budweiser , the product of us brewery anheuser busch . the company had laid down $ 40 million -lrb- € 29.8 million -rrb- for the rights to be one of the world cup 's main sponsors , and in return , was given a monopoly on beer sales in the world cup stadiums . while budweiser might be a top seller stateside , in germany - renowned for the variety and purity of its brews - bud is looked down on with scornful disdain .

for german soccer fans , things were looking grim . bitburger saves the day but politicians and breweries refused to accept defeat , and on tuesday , the head of marketing at german brewery bitburger emerged triumphant .
bitburger has signed an agreement with anheuser busch that will allow its brand of pilsner to be sold alongside budweiser . the ace up bitburger 's sleeve ?
years ago , the brewery had obtained a court ruling in its favor forbidding the advertising of budweiser in germany because there was a danger that german consumers would confuse " bit " with " bud . " what about the bratwurst ? for the sake of the world cup , however , both breweries have agreed to peacefully co-exist , leaving german soccer fans to grumble about an equally weighty problem - what exactly will they be washing down with their bits and buds ? will the traditional bratwurst be on the menu , or will they be forced to resort to american hamburgers ?

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .
" these are very long-term projects that aim to attract a different demographic to wedding , " said birgit hoplitschek from degewo 's marketing department .
skuza , the pet shop owner , did n't seem convinced .
" degewo is just blowing its own trumpet , " he said .
" it 's only interested in media-friendly campaigns when in fact , as a landlord , it does nothing for its tenants . "
" when i wanted to move into one of degewo 's subsidized spaces i was beaten to it by an artists ' collective , " he added .
" they might like artists , but they were n't ready to give a pet shop a chance .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "
bildunterschrift : sinti and roma scrap metal collectors use a horse-drawn carriage to transport an old car through the streets of bucharest .
by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .
but the country 's unemployment rate has remained stable at 6.6 percent , considerably better than in some more wealthy western european states .
and the chance of business and industry relocating to romania from countries further west once it becomes a part of the eu could mean even brighter job prospects on the horizon .
upbeat over eu despite the long-haul ahead , romanians remain upbeat about entering the eu .
some 76 percent of the 21.7 million population claim to have a “ very positive ” or “ fairly positive ” view of the eu , making romania the most eu-happy of all the member states and accession candidates .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.12.2004 romania still has work to finish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president traian basescu wants to lead romania to the eu in 2007 though granted a date to sign the accession treaty and become a member of europe ’ s most exclusive club , the eu has left a back door open in case romania doesn ’ t fulfill all the bloc 's entry criteria . recently elected president traian basescu has plenty of work to do if he wants to keep his election promise of leading romania to european union membership in 2007 .
the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "
bildunterschrift : sinti and roma scrap metal collectors use a horse-drawn carriage to transport an old car through the streets of bucharest .
by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .
but the country 's unemployment rate has remained stable at 6.6 percent , considerably better than in some more wealthy western european states .
and the chance of business and industry relocating to romania from countries further west once it becomes a part of the eu could mean even brighter job prospects on the horizon .
upbeat over eu despite the long-haul ahead , romanians remain upbeat about entering the eu .
some 76 percent of the 21.7 million population claim to have a “ very positive ” or “ fairly positive ” view of the eu , making romania the most eu-happy of all the member states and accession candidates .

but things are looking up . it was almost sacriligious .
fans crowding the stadiums for the 2006 world cup would be limited to only one brand of beer to wet their whistles - budweiser , the product of us brewery anheuser busch . the company had laid down $ 40 million -lrb- € 29.8 million -rrb- for the rights to be one of the world cup 's main sponsors , and in return , was given a monopoly on beer sales in the world cup stadiums . while budweiser might be a top seller stateside , in germany - renowned for the variety and purity of its brews - bud is looked down on with scornful disdain .
it 's watery and lacks any " kick , " say german connoisseurs .
for german soccer fans , things were looking grim . bitburger saves the day but politicians and breweries refused to accept defeat , and on tuesday , the head of marketing at german brewery bitburger emerged triumphant .
bitburger has signed an agreement with anheuser busch that will allow its brand of pilsner to be sold alongside budweiser . the ace up bitburger 's sleeve ?
years ago , the brewery had obtained a court ruling in its favor forbidding the advertising of budweiser in germany because there was a danger that german consumers would confuse " bit " with " bud . " what about the bratwurst ? for the sake of the world cup , however , both breweries have agreed to peacefully co-exist , leaving german soccer fans to grumble about an equally weighty problem - what exactly will they be washing down with their bits and buds ? will the traditional bratwurst be on the menu , or will they be forced to resort to american hamburgers ?

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .

ja , bitte ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't catch goalie oli kahn drinking american beer germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .
but things are looking up . it was almost sacriligious .
fans crowding the stadiums for the 2006 world cup would be limited to only one brand of beer to wet their whistles - budweiser , the product of us brewery anheuser busch . the company had laid down $ 40 million -lrb- € 29.8 million -rrb- for the rights to be one of the world cup 's main sponsors , and in return , was given a monopoly on beer sales in the world cup stadiums . while budweiser might be a top seller stateside , in germany - renowned for the variety and purity of its brews - bud is looked down on with scornful disdain .
it 's watery and lacks any " kick , " say german connoisseurs .
for german soccer fans , things were looking grim . bitburger saves the day but politicians and breweries refused to accept defeat , and on tuesday , the head of marketing at german brewery bitburger emerged triumphant .
bitburger has signed an agreement with anheuser busch that will allow its brand of pilsner to be sold alongside budweiser . the ace up bitburger 's sleeve ?
years ago , the brewery had obtained a court ruling in its favor forbidding the advertising of budweiser in germany because there was a danger that german consumers would confuse " bit " with " bud . " what about the bratwurst ? for the sake of the world cup , however , both breweries have agreed to peacefully co-exist , leaving german soccer fans to grumble about an equally weighty problem - what exactly will they be washing down with their bits and buds ? will the traditional bratwurst be on the menu , or will they be forced to resort to american hamburgers ?

germany is home to some 1,850 foreign residents from the plant and animal world . they 're settlers of a sort , uprooted from their homes not always by choice , making their way in a new , unfamiliar country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but they are n't pioneers crossing the great plains in covered wagons , or refugees from war-torn or economically ravaged countries looking for a better life .
these are raccoons , oysters , crabs , grasses - plants and animals not native to germany , which have ended up in the country and whose arrival has some scientists worried . researchers at the university of rostock have found that some 1,500 foreign animal species have come to germany over the last few centuries along with about 350 plant species .
many fit in quite well to their new homes , but others can be harmful to the local environment , since that can throw the ecosystem out of balance , sandra blömacher , a scientist with the neozoa working group , told ddp news service . raccoons the most prominent of these new furry immigrants is the raccoon , the well-known omnivore from across the atlantic .
raccoons can be found in large numbers from canada to central america .
the greyish-brown mammal with the mask-like markings around the eyes has been in germany for years , brought over to be bred for its fur .
but since some broke out of captivity around 1930 , the adaptable raccoons have spread all over germany . the hunchbacked bandit , while cute from a distance , can be an annoyance to homeowners , who often complain of electrical cables chewed in two , trash cans overturned , or the scampering of little feet in the attic . hunters report coming across more and more foreign species in german forests .
according to the german hunting federation , the number of raccoons shot by hunters rose by 7.6 percent to 21,100 .

hunters reported bagging 15.8 percent more of the animals in 2004 as the year before . german authorities have encouraged hunters to continue to hunt these animals intensely . arrival by sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the primary immigration methods of foreign species is through international shipping .
ballast water , which ships carry for stabilization , often contains a multitude of exotic animals .
it is often dumped when a ship reaches its destination . stephen gollasch , a marine biologist from hamburg , carried out a study in which he found that 69 exotic sea dwellers , from small crabs to fish , arrive at german coastlines every second .
that number appears to be rising . in the meantime , scientists say 80 new species of marine animals have already settled in the north sea , a fact that can have serious consequences .
for example , the pacific oyster , which continues to spread in north sea waters , has begun to crowd out the native blue mussel , according to gollasch . he is calling for new international regulations that would force ships to change their ballast water on the open sea and not in harbors near the coast . no panic but ragnar kinzelbach , a professor at the university of rostock , has warned against panicking about these foreign guests .
central europe has traditionally welcomed many animal and plant species over the centuries and in contrast to some tropical ecosystems , has proved very robust in accommodating the newcomers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild boar , right , and related friend according to josef reichholf of the state zoological collection in munich , the damages that migrant animals and plants cause are fairly minimal compared with the trouble caused by some native species , such as deer or wild boar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deep sea sediment might have sparked evolution german scientists , sifting through dust on the ocean 's floor , have discovered stardust that may have helped initiate human evolution .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .
that 's when troops intercepted the train in werfen , austria . booty for officers and personnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz according to government documents , some of the property was requisitioned by us military officers to furnish homes and offices , sold in army commissaries or kept by military personnel .
some of the works of art were handed to the austrian government .
at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .
when attorneys then filed suit on behalf of the survivors in a us district court in miami in 2001 , the government invoked a statute of limitations and state immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capitol hill pressured government to reach settlement a judge lifted the limitations before ordering the sides to negotiate .
furthermore , various groups and members of congress pressured the department of justice to reach a deal .
one of those members was senator hillary clinton who said she was grateful that the government was " providing long overdue redress to these men and women . "
a finalized agreement is set to be submitted by feb .

"
he said the suggestions had been scrutinized closely in moscow . " we sould like to adopt these suggestions wholeheartedly , " he said , although he did not go into the particulars .
german authorities also would not reveal the exact nature of the suggestions presented to russia . questions about ukraine putin also said he was ready to discuss " all the questions at issue " regarding the cancelled presidential elections in ukraine as well as press freedom and " internal reforms in russia . " although economic cooperation , eu ties and educational exchanges between the two countries figure high on the agenda , it ’ s the uncomfortable issues of the ukrainian presidential election in a week ’ s time and the dismantling of yukos that overshadow the bilateral talks . the re-run of the controversial ukraine election , which pitted the pro-western opposition candidate viktor yushchenko against the kremlin-backed prime minister viktor yanukovych , sent a decisive rift through ties between the european union and russia .
schröder , who enjoys a warm personal friendship with putin in addition to maintaining one of the closest working relationships to russia , has been put in a difficult position over the situation in ukraine . schröder 's ukrainian conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder on a train on tuesday the chancellor likes to see himself as a bridge between the european union and russia , but he has found that role hard to reconcile with putin ’ s support for yanukovych .

schröder will try to minimize the discussions about ukraine and the only public declaration will be one that both sides can support : endorsement for free and fair elections during the re-run on dec .
26 . energy policy another issue unlikely to be aired publicly is the german government ’ s stance on russia ’ s auctioning off of the crown jewel of stricken oil giant yukos on sunday .
during high-profile bidding , a mystery company that is widely believed to be a front for the state-run gas monopoly gazprom , snatched up yuganskneftegaz for $ 9.35 billion -lrb- € 7.02 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yukos ' profitable daughter company , yuganskneftegaz , pumps a milion barrels a day the purchase by the high bidder , a previously unknown baikalfinansgroup , represents a death blow for yukos , whose ambitious billionaire founder mikhail khodorkovsky was arrested in october 2003 on fraud and tax evasion charges .
if the baikal group turns out to be a front for gazprom , it would put a large slice of the russian energy industry back into government hands . just ahead of the auction , gazprom negotiated with a consortium of european banks headed by deutsche bank to secure a € 10-billion loan to buy yuganskneftegaz , an attempt many experts saw as an effort to renationalize the russian oil industry . “ in reality , this is an example of creeping nationalization of a private industry , ” said frank umbach , an expert for energy security at the körber-center russia . keeping the gas lines open the german government , although aware of the complaints , did not raise any objections to the attempts because , as a spokesman said , “ it involves private economic activity . ”

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .
bühlbecker -lrb- photo -rrb- took over the company 28 years ago as sole owner and manager .
he said he feels a deep responsibility for the welfare of his workers and germany in general . this is reflected in some of the numerous awards bühlbecker has won of late .
in 2002 he was honored as the entrepreneur of the year in germany .
one year later , he was added to the list of best entrepreneurs of the world .
all this a small bit of sunshine , like in the company logo , at a time where gloom usually wins the economic headlines in german newspapers . monika lohmüller -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de striking gold with christmas the mountains near the eastern german village of seiffen have long been emptied of their tin and silver , but the people there have found a sustainable gold mine instead : christmas .

and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .

the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "
bildunterschrift : sinti and roma scrap metal collectors use a horse-drawn carriage to transport an old car through the streets of bucharest .
by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .
but the country 's unemployment rate has remained stable at 6.6 percent , considerably better than in some more wealthy western european states .
and the chance of business and industry relocating to romania from countries further west once it becomes a part of the eu could mean even brighter job prospects on the horizon .
upbeat over eu despite the long-haul ahead , romanians remain upbeat about entering the eu .
some 76 percent of the 21.7 million population claim to have a “ very positive ” or “ fairly positive ” view of the eu , making romania the most eu-happy of all the member states and accession candidates .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .
that 's when troops intercepted the train in werfen , austria . booty for officers and personnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz according to government documents , some of the property was requisitioned by us military officers to furnish homes and offices , sold in army commissaries or kept by military personnel .
some of the works of art were handed to the austrian government .
at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .
when attorneys then filed suit on behalf of the survivors in a us district court in miami in 2001 , the government invoked a statute of limitations and state immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capitol hill pressured government to reach settlement a judge lifted the limitations before ordering the sides to negotiate .
furthermore , various groups and members of congress pressured the department of justice to reach a deal .
one of those members was senator hillary clinton who said she was grateful that the government was " providing long overdue redress to these men and women . "
a finalized agreement is set to be submitted by feb .

fans crowding the stadiums for the 2006 world cup would be limited to only one brand of beer to wet their whistles - budweiser , the product of us brewery anheuser busch . the company had laid down $ 40 million -lrb- € 29.8 million -rrb- for the rights to be one of the world cup 's main sponsors , and in return , was given a monopoly on beer sales in the world cup stadiums . while budweiser might be a top seller stateside , in germany - renowned for the variety and purity of its brews - bud is looked down on with scornful disdain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.12.2004 berlin gets creative about waste of space großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " for rent " signs do little to boost a neighborhood 's image innovative projects launched by berlin 's housing bureaus to revamp neglected parts of the city and encourage artists to move in are bearing fruit - but also triggering local resentment . it might border berlin mitte , home to much of the most sought-after real estate in germany .
but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .
" these are very long-term projects that aim to attract a different demographic to wedding , " said birgit hoplitschek from degewo 's marketing department .
skuza , the pet shop owner , did n't seem convinced .
" degewo is just blowing its own trumpet , " he said .
" it 's only interested in media-friendly campaigns when in fact , as a landlord , it does nothing for its tenants . "
" when i wanted to move into one of degewo 's subsidized spaces i was beaten to it by an artists ' collective , " he added .
" they might like artists , but they were n't ready to give a pet shop a chance .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.12.2004 romania still has work to finish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president traian basescu wants to lead romania to the eu in 2007 though granted a date to sign the accession treaty and become a member of europe ’ s most exclusive club , the eu has left a back door open in case romania doesn ’ t fulfill all the bloc 's entry criteria . recently elected president traian basescu has plenty of work to do if he wants to keep his election promise of leading romania to european union membership in 2007 .
the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "
bildunterschrift : sinti and roma scrap metal collectors use a horse-drawn carriage to transport an old car through the streets of bucharest .
by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .
but the country 's unemployment rate has remained stable at 6.6 percent , considerably better than in some more wealthy western european states .
and the chance of business and industry relocating to romania from countries further west once it becomes a part of the eu could mean even brighter job prospects on the horizon .
upbeat over eu despite the long-haul ahead , romanians remain upbeat about entering the eu .
some 76 percent of the 21.7 million population claim to have a “ very positive ” or “ fairly positive ” view of the eu , making romania the most eu-happy of all the member states and accession candidates .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

these are raccoons , oysters , crabs , grasses - plants and animals not native to germany , which have ended up in the country and whose arrival has some scientists worried . researchers at the university of rostock have found that some 1,500 foreign animal species have come to germany over the last few centuries along with about 350 plant species .
many fit in quite well to their new homes , but others can be harmful to the local environment , since that can throw the ecosystem out of balance , sandra blömacher , a scientist with the neozoa working group , told ddp news service . raccoons the most prominent of these new furry immigrants is the raccoon , the well-known omnivore from across the atlantic .
raccoons can be found in large numbers from canada to central america .
the greyish-brown mammal with the mask-like markings around the eyes has been in germany for years , brought over to be bred for its fur .
but since some broke out of captivity around 1930 , the adaptable raccoons have spread all over germany . the hunchbacked bandit , while cute from a distance , can be an annoyance to homeowners , who often complain of electrical cables chewed in two , trash cans overturned , or the scampering of little feet in the attic . hunters report coming across more and more foreign species in german forests .

that number appears to be rising . in the meantime , scientists say 80 new species of marine animals have already settled in the north sea , a fact that can have serious consequences .
for example , the pacific oyster , which continues to spread in north sea waters , has begun to crowd out the native blue mussel , according to gollasch . he is calling for new international regulations that would force ships to change their ballast water on the open sea and not in harbors near the coast . no panic but ragnar kinzelbach , a professor at the university of rostock , has warned against panicking about these foreign guests .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.12.2004 germany wants russia to return rubens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin says the painting was stolen germany and russia on monday discussed the return of " trophy art " seized by the soviet union after world war ii .
still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .
that 's when troops intercepted the train in werfen , austria . booty for officers and personnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz according to government documents , some of the property was requisitioned by us military officers to furnish homes and offices , sold in army commissaries or kept by military personnel .
some of the works of art were handed to the austrian government .
at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .
when attorneys then filed suit on behalf of the survivors in a us district court in miami in 2001 , the government invoked a statute of limitations and state immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capitol hill pressured government to reach settlement a judge lifted the limitations before ordering the sides to negotiate .
furthermore , various groups and members of congress pressured the department of justice to reach a deal .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .
that 's when troops intercepted the train in werfen , austria . booty for officers and personnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz according to government documents , some of the property was requisitioned by us military officers to furnish homes and offices , sold in army commissaries or kept by military personnel .
some of the works of art were handed to the austrian government .
at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .
when attorneys then filed suit on behalf of the survivors in a us district court in miami in 2001 , the government invoked a statute of limitations and state immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capitol hill pressured government to reach settlement a judge lifted the limitations before ordering the sides to negotiate .
furthermore , various groups and members of congress pressured the department of justice to reach a deal .
one of those members was senator hillary clinton who said she was grateful that the government was " providing long overdue redress to these men and women . "

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .
bühlbecker -lrb- photo -rrb- took over the company 28 years ago as sole owner and manager .
he said he feels a deep responsibility for the welfare of his workers and germany in general . this is reflected in some of the numerous awards bühlbecker has won of late .
in 2002 he was honored as the entrepreneur of the year in germany .
one year later , he was added to the list of best entrepreneurs of the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.12.2004 putin says he 's ready to talk großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a strong friendship unites germany and russia in germany for a two-day visit , vladimir putin said he 's ready to work with the eu about the chechnya conflict and is prepared to answer questions about delicate subjects like ukraine and press freedom . chancellor gerhard schröder met russian president in hamburg on monday , the first day of a two-day visit that was initially planned to take place in september but was postponed due to the beslan hostage crisis . on monday evening , after talks with schröder , putin told reporters russia is prepared to work with germany and the european union toward finding a solution for the conflict in chechnya . he said his government had received " suggestions for a greater participation of germany and the eu " for " settlement of the chechnya problem . "
he said the suggestions had been scrutinized closely in moscow . " we sould like to adopt these suggestions wholeheartedly , " he said , although he did not go into the particulars .
german authorities also would not reveal the exact nature of the suggestions presented to russia . questions about ukraine putin also said he was ready to discuss " all the questions at issue " regarding the cancelled presidential elections in ukraine as well as press freedom and " internal reforms in russia . " although economic cooperation , eu ties and educational exchanges between the two countries figure high on the agenda , it ’ s the uncomfortable issues of the ukrainian presidential election in a week ’ s time and the dismantling of yukos that overshadow the bilateral talks . the re-run of the controversial ukraine election , which pitted the pro-western opposition candidate viktor yushchenko against the kremlin-backed prime minister viktor yanukovych , sent a decisive rift through ties between the european union and russia .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .
" these are very long-term projects that aim to attract a different demographic to wedding , " said birgit hoplitschek from degewo 's marketing department .
skuza , the pet shop owner , did n't seem convinced .
" degewo is just blowing its own trumpet , " he said .
" it 's only interested in media-friendly campaigns when in fact , as a landlord , it does nothing for its tenants . "
" when i wanted to move into one of degewo 's subsidized spaces i was beaten to it by an artists ' collective , " he added .
" they might like artists , but they were n't ready to give a pet shop a chance .

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .

he said he feels a deep responsibility for the welfare of his workers and germany in general . this is reflected in some of the numerous awards bühlbecker has won of late .
in 2002 he was honored as the entrepreneur of the year in germany .
one year later , he was added to the list of best entrepreneurs of the world .

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 21.12.2004 germany wants russia to return rubens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin says the painting was stolen germany and russia on monday discussed the return of " trophy art " seized by the soviet union after world war ii .
still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "
bildunterschrift : sinti and roma scrap metal collectors use a horse-drawn carriage to transport an old car through the streets of bucharest .
by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .
but the country 's unemployment rate has remained stable at 6.6 percent , considerably better than in some more wealthy western european states .
and the chance of business and industry relocating to romania from countries further west once it becomes a part of the eu could mean even brighter job prospects on the horizon .
upbeat over eu despite the long-haul ahead , romanians remain upbeat about entering the eu .
some 76 percent of the 21.7 million population claim to have a “ very positive ” or “ fairly positive ” view of the eu , making romania the most eu-happy of all the member states and accession candidates .

the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "
bildunterschrift : sinti and roma scrap metal collectors use a horse-drawn carriage to transport an old car through the streets of bucharest .
by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .
but the country 's unemployment rate has remained stable at 6.6 percent , considerably better than in some more wealthy western european states .
and the chance of business and industry relocating to romania from countries further west once it becomes a part of the eu could mean even brighter job prospects on the horizon .
upbeat over eu despite the long-haul ahead , romanians remain upbeat about entering the eu .
some 76 percent of the 21.7 million population claim to have a “ very positive ” or “ fairly positive ” view of the eu , making romania the most eu-happy of all the member states and accession candidates .

the islamic army in iraq is thought to belong in the latter category , though its only demand relating to the french hostages was that paris repeal a law banning girls from wearing islamic headscarves in french state schools . the french government refused , and that law came into effect in september . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraqi cleric demands release of french reporters an influential radical iraqi cleric demanded on sunday that the two french journalists kidnapped two weeks ago in iraq be immediately set free .

müller works for the society for german language in wiesbaden as an advisor on names , which involves ploughing through the roughly 30 enquiries that land on his desk daily . unlike in the united states , where almost anything goes , german law stipulates that first names must already exist in some language and clearly signify the child 's gender .
it 's müller 's job to ensure that 's the case , though the civil registry offices that use his services are n't obliged to abide by his recommendations . exotic first names have been trendy for some time , making up from 10 to 20 percent of the names in germany , müller said .

parents here are free to call their children " pumuckl " - which germans associate with a series of children 's movies and books about an imp of the same name - since it stems from nepomuk , an accepted german name .
the same goes for " pepsi-carola " as " pepsi " comes from " pepita . " müller said he does try to convince parents to change their minds when he thinks they might have gone too far - even if the name does exist .
" the girl 's name ' nagina , ' for example , comes from sanskrit , " he said .
" you do n't need much of an imagination to distort it .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .
" these are very long-term projects that aim to attract a different demographic to wedding , " said birgit hoplitschek from degewo 's marketing department .
skuza , the pet shop owner , did n't seem convinced .
" degewo is just blowing its own trumpet , " he said .
" it 's only interested in media-friendly campaigns when in fact , as a landlord , it does nothing for its tenants . "
" when i wanted to move into one of degewo 's subsidized spaces i was beaten to it by an artists ' collective , " he added .
" they might like artists , but they were n't ready to give a pet shop a chance .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .
that 's when troops intercepted the train in werfen , austria . booty for officers and personnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz according to government documents , some of the property was requisitioned by us military officers to furnish homes and offices , sold in army commissaries or kept by military personnel .
some of the works of art were handed to the austrian government .
at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .
when attorneys then filed suit on behalf of the survivors in a us district court in miami in 2001 , the government invoked a statute of limitations and state immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capitol hill pressured government to reach settlement a judge lifted the limitations before ordering the sides to negotiate .
furthermore , various groups and members of congress pressured the department of justice to reach a deal .
one of those members was senator hillary clinton who said she was grateful that the government was " providing long overdue redress to these men and women . "
a finalized agreement is set to be submitted by feb .

that 's when troops intercepted the train in werfen , austria . booty for officers and personnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz according to government documents , some of the property was requisitioned by us military officers to furnish homes and offices , sold in army commissaries or kept by military personnel .
some of the works of art were handed to the austrian government .
at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .
when attorneys then filed suit on behalf of the survivors in a us district court in miami in 2001 , the government invoked a statute of limitations and state immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capitol hill pressured government to reach settlement a judge lifted the limitations before ordering the sides to negotiate .
furthermore , various groups and members of congress pressured the department of justice to reach a deal .
one of those members was senator hillary clinton who said she was grateful that the government was " providing long overdue redress to these men and women . "

but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .

after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .

two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .

" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .

the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.12.2004 romania still has work to finish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president traian basescu wants to lead romania to the eu in 2007 though granted a date to sign the accession treaty and become a member of europe ’ s most exclusive club , the eu has left a back door open in case romania doesn ’ t fulfill all the bloc 's entry criteria . recently elected president traian basescu has plenty of work to do if he wants to keep his election promise of leading romania to european union membership in 2007 .
the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "
bildunterschrift : sinti and roma scrap metal collectors use a horse-drawn carriage to transport an old car through the streets of bucharest .
by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .
but the country 's unemployment rate has remained stable at 6.6 percent , considerably better than in some more wealthy western european states .
and the chance of business and industry relocating to romania from countries further west once it becomes a part of the eu could mean even brighter job prospects on the horizon .
upbeat over eu despite the long-haul ahead , romanians remain upbeat about entering the eu .
some 76 percent of the 21.7 million population claim to have a “ very positive ” or “ fairly positive ” view of the eu , making romania the most eu-happy of all the member states and accession candidates .

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .
bühlbecker -lrb- photo -rrb- took over the company 28 years ago as sole owner and manager .
he said he feels a deep responsibility for the welfare of his workers and germany in general . this is reflected in some of the numerous awards bühlbecker has won of late .
in 2002 he was honored as the entrepreneur of the year in germany .
one year later , he was added to the list of best entrepreneurs of the world .
all this a small bit of sunshine , like in the company logo , at a time where gloom usually wins the economic headlines in german newspapers . monika lohmüller -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de striking gold with christmas the mountains near the eastern german village of seiffen have long been emptied of their tin and silver , but the people there have found a sustainable gold mine instead : christmas .

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .

at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

these are raccoons , oysters , crabs , grasses - plants and animals not native to germany , which have ended up in the country and whose arrival has some scientists worried . researchers at the university of rostock have found that some 1,500 foreign animal species have come to germany over the last few centuries along with about 350 plant species .
many fit in quite well to their new homes , but others can be harmful to the local environment , since that can throw the ecosystem out of balance , sandra blömacher , a scientist with the neozoa working group , told ddp news service . raccoons the most prominent of these new furry immigrants is the raccoon , the well-known omnivore from across the atlantic .

that number appears to be rising . in the meantime , scientists say 80 new species of marine animals have already settled in the north sea , a fact that can have serious consequences .
for example , the pacific oyster , which continues to spread in north sea waters , has begun to crowd out the native blue mussel , according to gollasch . he is calling for new international regulations that would force ships to change their ballast water on the open sea and not in harbors near the coast . no panic but ragnar kinzelbach , a professor at the university of rostock , has warned against panicking about these foreign guests .

germany is home to some 1,850 foreign residents from the plant and animal world . they 're settlers of a sort , uprooted from their homes not always by choice , making their way in a new , unfamiliar country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but they are n't pioneers crossing the great plains in covered wagons , or refugees from war-torn or economically ravaged countries looking for a better life .
these are raccoons , oysters , crabs , grasses - plants and animals not native to germany , which have ended up in the country and whose arrival has some scientists worried . researchers at the university of rostock have found that some 1,500 foreign animal species have come to germany over the last few centuries along with about 350 plant species .
many fit in quite well to their new homes , but others can be harmful to the local environment , since that can throw the ecosystem out of balance , sandra blömacher , a scientist with the neozoa working group , told ddp news service . raccoons the most prominent of these new furry immigrants is the raccoon , the well-known omnivore from across the atlantic .
raccoons can be found in large numbers from canada to central america .
the greyish-brown mammal with the mask-like markings around the eyes has been in germany for years , brought over to be bred for its fur .
but since some broke out of captivity around 1930 , the adaptable raccoons have spread all over germany . the hunchbacked bandit , while cute from a distance , can be an annoyance to homeowners , who often complain of electrical cables chewed in two , trash cans overturned , or the scampering of little feet in the attic . hunters report coming across more and more foreign species in german forests .
according to the german hunting federation , the number of raccoons shot by hunters rose by 7.6 percent to 21,100 .
martens , a relative of the weasel , are also making their presence felt .
hunters reported bagging 15.8 percent more of the animals in 2004 as the year before . german authorities have encouraged hunters to continue to hunt these animals intensely . arrival by sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the primary immigration methods of foreign species is through international shipping .
ballast water , which ships carry for stabilization , often contains a multitude of exotic animals .
it is often dumped when a ship reaches its destination . stephen gollasch , a marine biologist from hamburg , carried out a study in which he found that 69 exotic sea dwellers , from small crabs to fish , arrive at german coastlines every second .
that number appears to be rising . in the meantime , scientists say 80 new species of marine animals have already settled in the north sea , a fact that can have serious consequences .
for example , the pacific oyster , which continues to spread in north sea waters , has begun to crowd out the native blue mussel , according to gollasch . he is calling for new international regulations that would force ships to change their ballast water on the open sea and not in harbors near the coast . no panic but ragnar kinzelbach , a professor at the university of rostock , has warned against panicking about these foreign guests .
central europe has traditionally welcomed many animal and plant species over the centuries and in contrast to some tropical ecosystems , has proved very robust in accommodating the newcomers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild boar , right , and related friend according to josef reichholf of the state zoological collection in munich , the damages that migrant animals and plants cause are fairly minimal compared with the trouble caused by some native species , such as deer or wild boar . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deep sea sediment might have sparked evolution german scientists , sifting through dust on the ocean 's floor , have discovered stardust that may have helped initiate human evolution .

"
villas and workshops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the 1920s , the town shipped toys , often handmade , to the rest of the world .
although history played its part in phasing out much of the business during the course of the century - this part of the country became east germany during world war ii - there are still a number of toy makers in the region , and the tradition lives on .
a stroll through the town shows the signs of the wealth the toy business brought : villas of former toy manufacturers , erstwhile trading establishments and workshops , town halls and schools .
there is also the german toy museum , the oldest in the country .
it attracts visitors to sonneberg from all over the world , with some 60,000 items in its collection , 6,000 exhibit pieces , and a unique library of toy history .
there you can read about how arduous a task it was to make the filigree toys from the early 19th century .
the top floor of the toy museum is dedicated to dolls .
competition blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the area around sonneberg , most families were in some way tied to the making of toys .
after the region became part of east germany , the businesses were nationalized .
today , the challenge for the remaining toy makers is to compete on the open market against toys made in low-wage countries .
while toys are important to a german christmas , so are christmas trees - and with the trees , the decorations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauscha also makes these plain red christmas ornaments the cradle of glass christmas tree decorations is the small thuringian city of lauscha .
in 1835 , a human glass eye was made in the town , adding to its international renown for glassmaking .
christmas ornaments in lauscha , the museum of glass art documents the origins of ornament making .
in the beginning , cotton batting was shaped into winter motifs , covered with decorative paper , and covered with clear paste and glittery glass dust .
today in lauscha , " weinachtsland , " or " christmas land , " is open year round .
you can see the breakable artworks being created , and buy them , too : chubby cheeked angels , silvery christmas trees and icicles , colorful birds with feathery tails , exotic fruits , santa claus on a sled or a motorbike - over 10,000 different ornaments in all . gerd schmitz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de striking gold with christmas the mountains near the eastern german village of seiffen have long been emptied of their tin and silver , but the people there have found a sustainable gold mine instead : christmas .

the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .

" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .

the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .

but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .

" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "

by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .
but the country 's unemployment rate has remained stable at 6.6 percent , considerably better than in some more wealthy western european states .
and the chance of business and industry relocating to romania from countries further west once it becomes a part of the eu could mean even brighter job prospects on the horizon .
upbeat over eu despite the long-haul ahead , romanians remain upbeat about entering the eu .

he said the suggestions had been scrutinized closely in moscow . " we sould like to adopt these suggestions wholeheartedly , " he said , although he did not go into the particulars .
german authorities also would not reveal the exact nature of the suggestions presented to russia . questions about ukraine putin also said he was ready to discuss " all the questions at issue " regarding the cancelled presidential elections in ukraine as well as press freedom and " internal reforms in russia . " although economic cooperation , eu ties and educational exchanges between the two countries figure high on the agenda , it ’ s the uncomfortable issues of the ukrainian presidential election in a week ’ s time and the dismantling of yukos that overshadow the bilateral talks . the re-run of the controversial ukraine election , which pitted the pro-western opposition candidate viktor yushchenko against the kremlin-backed prime minister viktor yanukovych , sent a decisive rift through ties between the european union and russia .

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .
bühlbecker -lrb- photo -rrb- took over the company 28 years ago as sole owner and manager .
he said he feels a deep responsibility for the welfare of his workers and germany in general . this is reflected in some of the numerous awards bühlbecker has won of late .
in 2002 he was honored as the entrepreneur of the year in germany .
one year later , he was added to the list of best entrepreneurs of the world .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .
" these are very long-term projects that aim to attract a different demographic to wedding , " said birgit hoplitschek from degewo 's marketing department .
skuza , the pet shop owner , did n't seem convinced .
" degewo is just blowing its own trumpet , " he said .
" it 's only interested in media-friendly campaigns when in fact , as a landlord , it does nothing for its tenants . "
" when i wanted to move into one of degewo 's subsidized spaces i was beaten to it by an artists ' collective , " he added .

" andalucia " was conceived during a spanish vacation and " nemax 's " mother works for the stock exchange . " parents ' imaginations are sometimes boundless when it comes to naming their offspring , " according to gerhard müller , who should know what he 's talking about .
müller works for the society for german language in wiesbaden as an advisor on names , which involves ploughing through the roughly 30 enquiries that land on his desk daily . unlike in the united states , where almost anything goes , german law stipulates that first names must already exist in some language and clearly signify the child 's gender .
it 's müller 's job to ensure that 's the case , though the civil registry offices that use his services are n't obliged to abide by his recommendations . exotic first names have been trendy for some time , making up from 10 to 20 percent of the names in germany , müller said .
he put it down to society 's focus on individualism .
at the moment , indian and native american names are popular , he said . pepsi but no coke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pumuckl but even with the restrictions , seemingly silly names still make the grade .
parents here are free to call their children " pumuckl " - which germans associate with a series of children 's movies and books about an imp of the same name - since it stems from nepomuk , an accepted german name .
the same goes for " pepsi-carola " as " pepsi " comes from " pepita . " müller said he does try to convince parents to change their minds when he thinks they might have gone too far - even if the name does exist .
" the girl 's name ' nagina , ' for example , comes from sanskrit , " he said .
" you do n't need much of an imagination to distort it .
and we all know how mean children can be . "
in the end , " nagina " became the girl 's middle name .
but müller gave the thumbs-down to " mcdonald , " " bierstübel " -lrb- ale house -rrb- and " störenfried " -lrb- troublemaker -rrb- . not only does law prohibit parents from giving their kids the names of products , it limits how many they can have .
a düsseldorf court drew the line at a mother 's plea for permission to give her son twelve names of different origin to show the boy that " people 's hearts know no borders . "
she had wanted to call the boy " chenekwahow migiskau mikapi-hun-nizeo alessandro majim chayara inti ernesto prithibe kioma pathar henriko .

at the cookie manufacturer lambertz in aachen , the factories are running at full capacity to meet the current demands .
the company is the largest german producer of gingerbread cookies and now exports worldwide . unless you have a cold , you will not miss the smell of sweets in the air at the omnipresent christmas markets in german cities and towns .
one unmistakable scent is that of gingerbread .
the lambertz cookie company , based in aachen , germany , makes its money off of it .
with sales over € 400 million -lrb- $ 532 million -rrb- , lambertz is the main player on the german christmas cookie market .
and it is seducing sweet tooths now in north america and eastern europe . lambertz 's ingredients include hazelnuts , walnuts , almonds , candied orange and lemons , honey , flour , sugar , eggs , marzipan and most importantly , spices : anis , ginger , coriander , cloves , cinnamon - just to name a few - are all combined to produce a variety of cookies , including the trademark " printen " cookie .
the origins of the cookie are uncertain .
some proudly speculate that charlemagne , whose throne still stands in aachen , was the inventor of the rectangular cookie .
but that is just speculation . supplier of church and city hall bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lambertz is sole supplier to aachen 's cathedral one thing is certain : the lambertz tradition dates back to 1688 when the family bought the rights to establish a bakery on aachen 's main market .
the name of the bakery was called zur sonne - in reference to the reigning monarch in france at that time , louis xiv , the sun king .
for over three centuries lambertz , who still use the sun in their logo , has been the exclusive supplier to both the aachen cathedral and city hall . in 1820 , the first " printen " was produced , said current sole owner , hermann bühlbecker , a descendant of the lambertz family .
it takes a strong jaw to bite into the cookies .
there is also the chocolate covered variety , created by accident in the late 19th century by one of the family 's daughters . earlier , the cookies were produced laboriously by hand .
the forefathers of the company would be proud of the modern production lines where a scent of christmas emanates from the cookies as they glide past . plants in eastern europe gingerbread or " printen " do not hold a firm foothold just in germany .
in eastern europe , particularly where germans once lived , gingerbread is beloved , bühlbecker said .
the aroma of gingerbread belongs to the christmas tradition in the german-speaking regions in central and eastern europe . besides the six factories in germany , lambertz has a plant in katowice , poland to cater to the markets in poland , the czech republic and hungary .
now , lambertz is also finding out that north americans have grown fond of their various baked goods .
bühlbecker said they print " german cookies " or " european cookies " on the boxes for the large supermarket chains in north america . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hermann bühlbecker some 3,500 employees work for lambertz .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .

at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .

the us was not quick to come clean in the " hungarian gold train " affair . after years of litigation , jewish survivors of the holocaust and us officials have agreed to settle a suit over gold , silver , art and other valuables stolen by the nazis and confiscated by the us after world war ii . during a three-year court battle , holocaust survivors had alleged that us officers looted a train filled with valuables that nazis had seized from hungarian jews .
as many as 30,000 survivors filed the class-action suit , each one having sought a financial award of up to $ 10,000 -lrb- € 7,400 -rrb- .
details of what is believed to be the first suit against the us over property stolen by the nazis are not yet available . " i think everyone is glad that we got to this point and they are appreciative and they feel that -lrb- the agreement -rrb- is appropriate under the circumstances given the length of time for the litigation , " said the plaintiffs ' attorney , samuel dubbin . the treasures had been stolen from hungarian jews by the government of the third reich and were being transported to switzerland during the closing days of the war .
that 's when troops intercepted the train in werfen , austria . booty for officers and personnel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hungarian jews were deported to auschwitz according to government documents , some of the property was requisitioned by us military officers to furnish homes and offices , sold in army commissaries or kept by military personnel .
some of the works of art were handed to the austrian government .
at the time of the seizure , the estimated value of the goods ranged from $ 50 million to $ 200 million and today could be up to 10 times as much . " this settlement is not about restituting money , it 's about restituting history , " said gideon taylor , vice president of the conference on jewish material claims against germany .
" this is a moral step by the us to acknowledge the past . " for some survivors , the case has left a bitter taste in their mouth .
one plaintiff , irene tibor , 82 , said she does not know how much her family lost when they were evicted from their budapest apartment .
she added that she does not understand why the us gives " everything to old enemies – even enemies " but not to the " poor old people " living in miami . us tried to stonewall suit the trial stemmed from a us presidential commission report in 1999 that detailed the events of 1945 .
when attorneys then filed suit on behalf of the survivors in a us district court in miami in 2001 , the government invoked a statute of limitations and state immunity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capitol hill pressured government to reach settlement a judge lifted the limitations before ordering the sides to negotiate .
furthermore , various groups and members of congress pressured the department of justice to reach a deal .
one of those members was senator hillary clinton who said she was grateful that the government was " providing long overdue redress to these men and women . "

these are raccoons , oysters , crabs , grasses - plants and animals not native to germany , which have ended up in the country and whose arrival has some scientists worried . researchers at the university of rostock have found that some 1,500 foreign animal species have come to germany over the last few centuries along with about 350 plant species .
many fit in quite well to their new homes , but others can be harmful to the local environment , since that can throw the ecosystem out of balance , sandra blömacher , a scientist with the neozoa working group , told ddp news service . raccoons the most prominent of these new furry immigrants is the raccoon , the well-known omnivore from across the atlantic .

that number appears to be rising . in the meantime , scientists say 80 new species of marine animals have already settled in the north sea , a fact that can have serious consequences .

"
villas and workshops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the 1920s , the town shipped toys , often handmade , to the rest of the world .
although history played its part in phasing out much of the business during the course of the century - this part of the country became east germany during world war ii - there are still a number of toy makers in the region , and the tradition lives on .
a stroll through the town shows the signs of the wealth the toy business brought : villas of former toy manufacturers , erstwhile trading establishments and workshops , town halls and schools .
there is also the german toy museum , the oldest in the country .
it attracts visitors to sonneberg from all over the world , with some 60,000 items in its collection , 6,000 exhibit pieces , and a unique library of toy history .
there you can read about how arduous a task it was to make the filigree toys from the early 19th century .
the top floor of the toy museum is dedicated to dolls .
competition blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the area around sonneberg , most families were in some way tied to the making of toys .
after the region became part of east germany , the businesses were nationalized .
today , the challenge for the remaining toy makers is to compete on the open market against toys made in low-wage countries .
while toys are important to a german christmas , so are christmas trees - and with the trees , the decorations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauscha also makes these plain red christmas ornaments the cradle of glass christmas tree decorations is the small thuringian city of lauscha .
in 1835 , a human glass eye was made in the town , adding to its international renown for glassmaking .
christmas ornaments in lauscha , the museum of glass art documents the origins of ornament making .
in the beginning , cotton batting was shaped into winter motifs , covered with decorative paper , and covered with clear paste and glittery glass dust .
today in lauscha , " weinachtsland , " or " christmas land , " is open year round .
you can see the breakable artworks being created , and buy them , too : chubby cheeked angels , silvery christmas trees and icicles , colorful birds with feathery tails , exotic fruits , santa claus on a sled or a motorbike - over 10,000 different ornaments in all . gerd schmitz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de striking gold with christmas the mountains near the eastern german village of seiffen have long been emptied of their tin and silver , but the people there have found a sustainable gold mine instead : christmas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 21.12.2004 romania still has work to finish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president traian basescu wants to lead romania to the eu in 2007 though granted a date to sign the accession treaty and become a member of europe ’ s most exclusive club , the eu has left a back door open in case romania doesn ’ t fulfill all the bloc 's entry criteria . recently elected president traian basescu has plenty of work to do if he wants to keep his election promise of leading romania to european union membership in 2007 .
the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .
“ the european commission will continue to monitor closely developments in romania , ” scheele said .
accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "
bildunterschrift : sinti and roma scrap metal collectors use a horse-drawn carriage to transport an old car through the streets of bucharest .
by 2007 romania will have received about € 5 billion in aid or 1.4 percent of its gross domestic product from the eu during its seven-year path from negotiation to member status .
the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .
but the country 's unemployment rate has remained stable at 6.6 percent , considerably better than in some more wealthy western european states .
and the chance of business and industry relocating to romania from countries further west once it becomes a part of the eu could mean even brighter job prospects on the horizon .
upbeat over eu despite the long-haul ahead , romanians remain upbeat about entering the eu .

the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .

but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .

accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .

the funding was used to improve government institutions , revamp the country 's infrastructure and diversify rural economies .
those improvements , however , have not necessarily trickled down to the public .
the average romanian income is 30 percent that of other eu citizens and subject to huge discrepancies throughout the country : people living in bucharest have 140 percent higher incomes than those in rural areas .

accession is not an automatic guarantee just because the negotiations have proceeded so far .
eu-romanian trade increasing on the more positive side , trade between romania and the eu has increased noticeably in the last few years .
european union members received 67.7 percent or € 11.2 billion -lrb- $ 14.9 billion -rrb- worth of romania 's exports in 2003 , an increase of eight percent and contributed 57.6 percent of romania 's imports , bringing the bloc € 12.8 billion , which was 11.5 percent more than 2002 .
" romania is a functioning market economy , " scheele said .
" but its economy does not yet have sufficient strength to withstand the competitive pressures of the single market . "

the former mayor of bucharest campaigned on a plank of prosecuting corruption , one of the eu ’ s chief concerns regarding the eastern european country .
recognizing that it is the country 's biggest problem and affects both the political system and the fledgling market economy , basescu said he would go after the causes of corruption by firing civil servants involved in fraud and restructuring the institutions that investigate and prosecute such grievances .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to see more done to fight corruption " there are real problems of high level corruption in romania and this is an area where the new government needs to act firmly , " said jonathan scheele , head of the european commission 's delegation in romania .
two years left and a lot of work romania began its negotiations with the eu in february 2000 and with last week ’ s agreement concerning a date to sign an accession treaty , the country is on its way to being part of the european club ’ s fifth expansion in 2007 .
but romania will also have to focus on more than just fighting corruption if it plans to keep on track to join the eu in 2007 .
fifteen years after the collapse of the ceausescu dictatorship , the country still has a ways to go to bring it in line with the rest of the european union .
it needs to continue pushing through judiciary and legislative reforms and work more effectively to stop human trafficking , for instance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania 's parliament in bucharest bucharest also has to convince brussels that it is actively applying the new reforms .
laws stopping the discrimination of the roma are already on the books , for example , but the eu has called for the romanian government to do more than pay them lip service and actually put an end to the de facto discrimination against the minority that comprises 2.4 percent of romania 's population .
built-in brakes to make sure romania , like fellow eu aspirant bulgaria , follows through implementing their revamped legislation , their accession treaties include a " safeguard clause " - a type of accession emergency brake the eu executive can pull to slow down membership by one year should any serious shortcomings come to light .
" we have problems at the level of public administration , justice , freedom of the press , lack of competition on the market , " calin tariceany , a possible choice for prime minister told reuters , addressing some of the key issues the eu wants cleared up before romania can be welcomed into the fold of 25 .

"
villas and workshops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the 1920s , the town shipped toys , often handmade , to the rest of the world .
although history played its part in phasing out much of the business during the course of the century - this part of the country became east germany during world war ii - there are still a number of toy makers in the region , and the tradition lives on .
a stroll through the town shows the signs of the wealth the toy business brought : villas of former toy manufacturers , erstwhile trading establishments and workshops , town halls and schools .
there is also the german toy museum , the oldest in the country .
it attracts visitors to sonneberg from all over the world , with some 60,000 items in its collection , 6,000 exhibit pieces , and a unique library of toy history .
there you can read about how arduous a task it was to make the filigree toys from the early 19th century .
the top floor of the toy museum is dedicated to dolls .
competition blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the area around sonneberg , most families were in some way tied to the making of toys .
after the region became part of east germany , the businesses were nationalized .
today , the challenge for the remaining toy makers is to compete on the open market against toys made in low-wage countries .
while toys are important to a german christmas , so are christmas trees - and with the trees , the decorations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauscha also makes these plain red christmas ornaments the cradle of glass christmas tree decorations is the small thuringian city of lauscha .
in 1835 , a human glass eye was made in the town , adding to its international renown for glassmaking .
christmas ornaments in lauscha , the museum of glass art documents the origins of ornament making .
in the beginning , cotton batting was shaped into winter motifs , covered with decorative paper , and covered with clear paste and glittery glass dust .
today in lauscha , " weinachtsland , " or " christmas land , " is open year round .
you can see the breakable artworks being created , and buy them , too : chubby cheeked angels , silvery christmas trees and icicles , colorful birds with feathery tails , exotic fruits , santa claus on a sled or a motorbike - over 10,000 different ornaments in all . gerd schmitz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de striking gold with christmas the mountains near the eastern german village of seiffen have long been emptied of their tin and silver , but the people there have found a sustainable gold mine instead : christmas .

"
villas and workshops bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in the 1920s , the town shipped toys , often handmade , to the rest of the world .
although history played its part in phasing out much of the business during the course of the century - this part of the country became east germany during world war ii - there are still a number of toy makers in the region , and the tradition lives on .
a stroll through the town shows the signs of the wealth the toy business brought : villas of former toy manufacturers , erstwhile trading establishments and workshops , town halls and schools .
there is also the german toy museum , the oldest in the country .
it attracts visitors to sonneberg from all over the world , with some 60,000 items in its collection , 6,000 exhibit pieces , and a unique library of toy history .
there you can read about how arduous a task it was to make the filigree toys from the early 19th century .
the top floor of the toy museum is dedicated to dolls .
competition blues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the area around sonneberg , most families were in some way tied to the making of toys .
after the region became part of east germany , the businesses were nationalized .
today , the challenge for the remaining toy makers is to compete on the open market against toys made in low-wage countries .
while toys are important to a german christmas , so are christmas trees - and with the trees , the decorations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauscha also makes these plain red christmas ornaments the cradle of glass christmas tree decorations is the small thuringian city of lauscha .
in 1835 , a human glass eye was made in the town , adding to its international renown for glassmaking .
christmas ornaments in lauscha , the museum of glass art documents the origins of ornament making .
in the beginning , cotton batting was shaped into winter motifs , covered with decorative paper , and covered with clear paste and glittery glass dust .
today in lauscha , " weinachtsland , " or " christmas land , " is open year round .
you can see the breakable artworks being created , and buy them , too : chubby cheeked angels , silvery christmas trees and icicles , colorful birds with feathery tails , exotic fruits , santa claus on a sled or a motorbike - over 10,000 different ornaments in all . gerd schmitz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de striking gold with christmas the mountains near the eastern german village of seiffen have long been emptied of their tin and silver , but the people there have found a sustainable gold mine instead : christmas .

" prime minister jean-pierre raffarin informed the french senate " with deep joy " that the two , christian chesnot of radio france internationale and georges malbrunot of le figaro newspaper , had been released . the iraqi insurgency group that had been holding the pair , the islamic army in iraq , said it had freed the reporters because of france 's stand against the us-led war in iraq and its support for palestinian statehood , the arabic television station al-jazeera reported . the brother of one of the reporters , thierry chesnot , said the two were in amman late tuesday and would be brought to paris on wednesday . an early christmas " this is a huge relief .

" chesnot , 37 , and malbrunot , 41 - the longest-held western hostages in iraq - were seized on a road south of baghdad on august 20 . several other hostages taken during the iraqi insurgency have been killed by their captors . a french foreign ministry spokesman , herve ladsous , said : " they have been freed .

french officials said they had contact with the islamic army in iraq , but did not say if it was direct or indirect . reasons for liberation according to a statement by the islamic army in iraq quoted by al-jazeera , the pair were freed " because they were proven not to spy for us forces , in response to appeals and demands from islamic institutions and bodies , and in appreciation of the french government 's stand on the iraq issue and the two journalists ' stand on the palestinian cause . " raffarin , who had interrupted a senate debate to announce the reporters ' liberation , said " our joy will be complete when they are safely on national soil . "
the lower house of parliament , in a separate session , greeted the news with applause . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret hassan hostage-taking has become common in iraq , where chaos and bloodshed have taken hold despite efforts by a us-led military coalition to impose security .
foreigners are particularly targeted , and several , including an aid worker with british and iraqi nationality , margaret hassan -lrb- photo9 , have been murdered by their captors . several insurgency groups are believed to be involved in abductions , ranging from religious extremists to well-financed guerrillas .
the islamic army in iraq is thought to belong in the latter category , though its only demand relating to the french hostages was that paris repeal a law banning girls from wearing islamic headscarves in french state schools . the french government refused , and that law came into effect in september . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraqi cleric demands release of french reporters an influential radical iraqi cleric demanded on sunday that the two french journalists kidnapped two weeks ago in iraq be immediately set free .

ja , bitte ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you wo n't catch goalie oli kahn drinking american beer germans revere soccer almost as much as they do their beer , so fans of both found it hard to swallow the news that only american beer would be sold in stadiums when germany hosts the world cup .
but things are looking up . it was almost sacriligious .
fans crowding the stadiums for the 2006 world cup would be limited to only one brand of beer to wet their whistles - budweiser , the product of us brewery anheuser busch . the company had laid down $ 40 million -lrb- € 29.8 million -rrb- for the rights to be one of the world cup 's main sponsors , and in return , was given a monopoly on beer sales in the world cup stadiums . while budweiser might be a top seller stateside , in germany - renowned for the variety and purity of its brews - bud is looked down on with scornful disdain .
it 's watery and lacks any " kick , " say german connoisseurs .
for german soccer fans , things were looking grim . bitburger saves the day but politicians and breweries refused to accept defeat , and on tuesday , the head of marketing at german brewery bitburger emerged triumphant .
bitburger has signed an agreement with anheuser busch that will allow its brand of pilsner to be sold alongside budweiser . the ace up bitburger 's sleeve ?
years ago , the brewery had obtained a court ruling in its favor forbidding the advertising of budweiser in germany because there was a danger that german consumers would confuse " bit " with " bud . " what about the bratwurst ? for the sake of the world cup , however , both breweries have agreed to peacefully co-exist , leaving german soccer fans to grumble about an equally weighty problem - what exactly will they be washing down with their bits and buds ? will the traditional bratwurst be on the menu , or will they be forced to resort to american hamburgers ?

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .
" these are very long-term projects that aim to attract a different demographic to wedding , " said birgit hoplitschek from degewo 's marketing department .
skuza , the pet shop owner , did n't seem convinced .
" degewo is just blowing its own trumpet , " he said .
" it 's only interested in media-friendly campaigns when in fact , as a landlord , it does nothing for its tenants . "
" when i wanted to move into one of degewo 's subsidized spaces i was beaten to it by an artists ' collective , " he added .
" they might like artists , but they were n't ready to give a pet shop a chance .

thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .
" these are very long-term projects that aim to attract a different demographic to wedding , " said birgit hoplitschek from degewo 's marketing department .
skuza , the pet shop owner , did n't seem convinced .
" degewo is just blowing its own trumpet , " he said .
" it 's only interested in media-friendly campaigns when in fact , as a landlord , it does nothing for its tenants . "
" when i wanted to move into one of degewo 's subsidized spaces i was beaten to it by an artists ' collective , " he added .
" they might like artists , but they were n't ready to give a pet shop a chance .

" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .

after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .

however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .
" these are very long-term projects that aim to attract a different demographic to wedding , " said birgit hoplitschek from degewo 's marketing department .
skuza , the pet shop owner , did n't seem convinced .
" degewo is just blowing its own trumpet , " he said .
" it 's only interested in media-friendly campaigns when in fact , as a landlord , it does nothing for its tenants . "
" when i wanted to move into one of degewo 's subsidized spaces i was beaten to it by an artists ' collective , " he added .
" they might like artists , but they were n't ready to give a pet shop a chance .

still , berlin has little hope of recovering a priceless rubens painting owned by a russian businessman . the atmosphere was " good " when german culture secretary christina weiss and her russian counterpart alexander solokov talked about the issue of trophy art , according to news agency ddp .
but it may make no difference in the case of rubens ' masterpiece " tristan and lucretia . " " the painting is the most important work missing from the collection of berlin 's museum and gardens foundation , " a spokesman for weiss said monday .
" we would like it back . " weiss said over the weekend the government was considering taking private legal action in russia to recover the canvas flemish master peter paul rubens painted of the mythological rape of lucretia between 1609 and 1612 .
a legal assessment commissioned by weiss had determined that russian businessman vladimir logvinenko was not the work 's rightful owner .
bildunterschrift : sanssouci palace until 1942 the painting hung in sanssouci palace in potsdam , near berlin : prussian king frederick the great had bought it in 1765 for his collection .
subsequently it may have adorned the walls of the country mansion of joseph goebbels , the nazi propaganda minister .
after the red army 's victory over the nazis , the painting is thought to have been plundered by a soviet officer .
the man brought the masterpiece to russia and hung it on his living room wall . russia accepts stealing not only was plundering common after world war ii , but both the soviet state and , in 1997 , the russian parliament declared that trophy art appropriated from germany legally belonged to the war 's victors .
however , private plundering was never sanctioned . logvinenko insists he is the painting 's rightful owner , having bought it from an antique dealer in 1999 , a stance that was confirmed by russia 's prosecutor general earlier this year .
a court in germany ruled in october that the government had not shown enough evidence to prove the painting was stolen . trophy art has been an issue between germany and russia for years , and despite berlin 's efforts and occasional expressions of good will from moscow , only a handful of the two million books , one million artwork and three kilometers of artifacts germany believes to be in russian hands have been returned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and putin met monday in hamburg thus , the cards appear to be stacked against weiss recovering the rubens , even if she does pursue legal action in russia unless chancellor gerhard schröder takes up the issue with russian president vladimir putin .
so far , though , he has n't made any indication he will . experts value " tristan and lucretia " at around € 80 million -lrb- $ 107 million -rrb- .
the painting had long been considered lost when logvinenko offered to sell it to the foundation for prussian palaces and gardens in feb .

but the run-down district of wedding is a far cry from the back-to-back cafés , galleries and designer stores of central berlin .
with an ever-increasing immigrant population and up to 15 percent of its commercial space empty , the neighborhood has something of a reputation as berlin 's badlands .
steffen skuza owns a local pet shop in the area .
as far as he 's concerned , the degewo group , which owns many of the tenement blocks in wedding , is indifferent to the neighborhood 's decline because at least tenants claiming housing benefits can be relied on to pay their rent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wedding has become a ghetto " a lot of the original residents have moved away in the last few years because this neighborhood has gone downhill so much , " he said .
" degewo does n't care who moves into its properties so long as the rent gets paid .
it 's become a ghetto . "
reclaim the shops degewo , however , insists that urban renewal is its first priority .
and whatever its tenants say about its reliability as a landlord , it 's found inventive ways of dealing with the neighborhood 's unused apartments and commercial space , in the process helping to change wedding 's pitiful profile .
three years ago , it entered into a partnership with a local initiative called " kolonie wedding , " a project dreamt up by wedding 's " quartiersmanagement , " one of berlin 's 17 local eu-funded offices responsible for urban development .
the scheme invited young artists to cross to the wrong side of the tracks and rent empty shop fronts at no expense other than running costs for a trial run .
degewo 's willingness to accept reduced rents adds up to support of some € 70,000 -lrb- $ 93,700 -rrb- a year .
the artists get cheap studio space , an opportunity to exhibit their work and a longer-term aim of obtaining a permanent lease , while the area - including the house-owners - reaps the benefits of the gentrification so often heralded by the arrival of art galleries .
lukas born from " kolonie wedding " said he feels that the degewo initiative is exemplary .
" they 've understood how to improve a neighborhood 's reputation , " he said .
" they 're using empty commercial space as an instrument in a way other housing bureaus are n't , and it 's a very legitimate move . "
ushering in gentrification similar projects are now up-and-running in other berlin districts previously overlooked by urban developers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : central berlin is thriving a sister initiative , the " boxion " project launched in 2001 in the friedrichshain district of former east berlin , was a major contributing factor to its emergence as berlin 's current " in " neighborhood .
the resulting slew of local art galleries , boutiques and graphic design studios put friedrichshain firmly on the cultural map .
in 2003 , " boxion " expanded into the neighboring district of kreuzberg with the opening of " project wrangler , " which entailed the opening of five new projects , including a legal practice .
the housing surplus over a decade of ambitious , well-subsidized city planning has left berlin with a surfeit of shop fronts , which are either too expensive to attract tenants or too off-the-beaten-track in modern , mall-ridden berlin .
thorsten tonndorf from the berlin senate for urban planning said that 23 new shopping malls have been built in berlin since 1990 and many more are still in a planning phase .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has seen a building boom in the last decade the problem is that in the last decade , the building boom failed to go hand-in-hand with an economic boom and consumer spending habits took unexpected turns , he added .
" what we never expected were such structural changes to the way people shop , " he said .
" we expected to see existing structures retained . "
instead , people headed in their droves to the malls and one by one , small local retailers were forced to close shop .
making a virtue of necessity today , some 160,000 apartments in berlin stand empty .
as lukas born from " kolonie wedding " pointed out , degewo has little to lose by lending artists free space .
bildunterschrift : further degewo projects include offering 500 apartments in wedding at a 50 percent discount to students for two semesters and an upcoming campaign romantically entitled " wedding dress . "
a fashion competition judged by a jury , the project will afford 15 winning designers free local store and studio space .
" these are very long-term projects that aim to attract a different demographic to wedding , " said birgit hoplitschek from degewo 's marketing department .
skuza , the pet shop owner , did n't seem convinced .
" degewo is just blowing its own trumpet , " he said .
" it 's only interested in media-friendly campaigns when in fact , as a landlord , it does nothing for its tenants . "
" when i wanted to move into one of degewo 's subsidized spaces i was beaten to it by an artists ' collective , " he added .
" they might like artists , but they were n't ready to give a pet shop a chance .

budget carrier ryanair appealed against a london county court ruling in january that airlines were responsible .
bob ross from islington , north london , was awarded £ 1,336 after he challenged an £ 18 charge to use a wheelchair at stansted airport in essex .
ryanair claimed the airport owner baa imposed the charge .
at the appeal hearing in november , romie tager qc , representing ryanair , said the airline was prepared to absorb the cost of paying for someone to push a wheelchair through the airport even though this meant that , on the £ 10 one-way ticket to perpignan which mr ross paid , the airline would make a loss .
surcharge added he said ryanair had not charged mr ross for the wheelchair and pusher - it was the airport which had charged .
" the responsible authority should be the airport operator which at stansted was a ' highly profitable ' business which had made a £ 137m profit in the last year . "
the airline was found to have breached the disability discrimination act .
ryanair has added a surcharge of 35p to tickets because of the ruling .
but the airline believes that the owner of the building that is responsible for disabled access .
